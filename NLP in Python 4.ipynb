    "So far, all of the analysis we've done has been pretty generic - looking at counts, creating scatter plots, etc. These techniques could be applied to numeric data as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to text data, there are a few popular techniques that we'll be going through in the next few notebooks, starting with sentiment analysis. A few key points to remember with sentiment analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **TextBlob Module:** Linguistic researchers have labeled the sentiment of words based on their domain expertise. Sentiment of words can vary based on where it is in a sentence. The TextBlob module allows us to take advantage of these labels.\n",
    "2. **Sentiment Labels:** Each word in a corpus is labeled in terms of polarity and subjectivity (there are more labels as well, but we're going to ignore them for now). A corpus' sentiment is the average of these.\n",
    "   * **Polarity**: How positive or negative a word is. -1 is very negative. +1 is very positive.\n",
    "   * **Subjectivity**: How subjective, or opinionated a word is. 0 is fact. +1 is very much an opinion.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more info on how TextBlob coded up its [sentiment function](https://planspace.org/20150607-textblob_sentiment/).\n",

    "Let's take a look at the sentiment of the various transcripts, both overall and throughout the comedy routine."

       "[['Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never kno',\n",
       "  'w when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!” My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you kno',\n",
       "  'w? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck u',\n",
       "  'p! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper ',\n",
       "  \"two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.” My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, \",\n",
       "  'your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!” ♪ A whole new world ♪ It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.” I’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pin',\n",
       "  'eapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. St',\n",
       "  \"iviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!” I don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image\",\n",
       "  ' of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am',\n",
       "  ' not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.” I can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy. You know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin. So, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

       " ['Yes! Thank you so much, Chicago. Thank you. I used to do something\\xa0a lot of comics do. I would blame my disgusting behavior on the city I was in. You know how people would be like, “Chicago, you got me so fucked up last night!” You know? And the crowd was like, “Okay. We were not here last night.” “Denver! You made me fuck that stranger, no condom. You’re crazy, Denver!” “Armed robbery? Philly, you silly.” “No, ma’am. We are concerned for you.” That’s all over now. Because I’m fucking pregnant! Yeah, I did it. I’m amazing. I laid there, and… that’s it. Usually, when someone in the public eye gets pregnant, there’s, like, a couple of months where there’s some rumors about them, you know? There’s some, like, “Oop, bump alert!” Right? Uh-oh. Uh… I was well into my second trimester. Not one fucking rumor about me. Nothing. I was photographed. Belly out. They’re like, “There’s Amy!” “Looking happy. I don’t know. Doing her.” And then so once people knew, they were like, “Is she showing?” They were like, “No more than normal. Kinda… It just kinda looks like she took her Spanx off.” There are all these rules about pregnancy that are unsaid. Where is it written that when you’re\\xa0pregnant, you have\\xa0to cup your little bump in every picture? It’s so obnoxious, guys. Every picture. Here… It’s all right. Some people do the two hand. I was like, okay, fuck it. I’ll do it, but I’m going to do it for the rest of my life. I’m going to be 90 years old like this, with a cigarette\\xa0in my mouth like… I do it. I cup the bump… in pictures, but I just do it a little bit lower. I just go right here. ‘Cause this is the area that got me in trouble in the first place. All the questions everyone… “What are\\xa0you having? Do you know what you’re having?” Hemorrhoids. Any other questions? Why do they ask, “What are you craving? What are you craving? Are you craving anything?” Cock! Just me and my angel. People always want to see the bump. That’s like the thing. “Just show me that\\xa0fucking bump, bitch.” And my belly button is getting so misshapen with this baby inside that I\\xa0had to put two Band-Aids over my belly\\xa0button tonight. That’s more than you bargained for, right? Somebody’s neglecting their bikini area. I… I’ll tell you who it’s not fun to be pregnant at the exact same time as. Meghan Markle. I think we’re, like, to the day the same amount pregnant. And she’s out there in, like, six-inch heels, adorable outfits, and she has like… There’s been no bump. Like, there’s been… She, like, cups where the bump will be, you know.\\xa0She’s like… “Here. Here’s where the baby will be.” People see me, they’re like, “The last couple of weeks are the hardest, right? Are you crowning? I think I can see an ear. Is that an ear?” If I were Meghan Markle… and I am… ‘Cause she hangs out with the Queen now. Like, they hang out and have conversations. If I were Meghan, no matter what the Queen\\xa0asked me, and I can’t do a great\\xa0British accent, but, you know, if she said something like, “La, la, la. Oh! Pip-pip! Would you like a spot of lemon?” Like probably exactly that, she probably says. No matter what, if I were Meghan, I would\\xa0answer everything she asks with, “Yas, Queen! Yas.” I just came so close to shitting myself. You guys don’t… This special almost became a real\\xa0special. That would have… What would I have done? Kind of just kicked it, and… trusted that you guys would be cool. Is that what I would have done? I have not had an easy pregnancy. I have hyperemesis,',\n",
       "  ' which I’d never even\\xa0heard of. It’s extreme nausea and vomiting. If you’ve ever had food poisoning, it’s that. I’ve had that every day for five months. No, and people are like, “You’re so strong. Look\\xa0at you out there. You’re on the road.” I’m contractually obligated to be out here, guys. I’m not like, “I don’t care. The show must\\xa0go on.” I’m like, “I will be sued by Live Nation.” That’s why I’m here. But I feel pretty good tonight, to be honest with you, so… I didn’t throw up today. Uh… Yeah, but I didn’t know that being pregnant could be really hard. Like… I didn’t know that because you\\xa0bitches all lie about it. Women don’t tell you how hard it is. I should have Googled it. I should have Googled being pregnant. ‘Cause it’s been really awful. ‘Cause in movies, they don’t show you. There’s just a montage where the girl’s in her office and she’s typing, and then\\xa0she’s like… And she runs to the bathroom, she throws up once! And then in the next scene, she’s in overalls painting a barn. Like, “Yay!” ♪ I can’t wait to meet you ♪ You know? I throw up an exorcist amount every day. And I feel like, you know, if you had\\xa0a good pregnancy, if you’re someone who enjoyed being pregnant, I just hope\\xa0your car flips over. That’s… That’s what I wish for you. Your car kind of Chappaquiddicks into a\\xa0lake, and you just kinda… …slowly… drown. Is that fair to say? Because here’s the thing. You’re pregnant, but you don’t change. I hate women who start to act really just precious and like, “Yes, now I’m… I’m a saint, and I never… I never had sex in a bathroom on a train,” you know? We’ve all had sex in the bathroom on a\\xa0train. You don’t stop being you, you know. You don’t stop working or drinking. Like, you… You know? I’ve gotten in the habit of asking, uh, friends’ recommendations and advice about pregnancy until I get the answer I\\xa0want. You know what I mean? I asked my most responsible\\xa0friend, she’s a nurse. I was like, “So, wine… what do you think? Should I just have\\xa0some, or what\\xa0do you think? While I’m pregnant. Wine? Definitely have some, or what do you think?” And… And she was like, “You know what? Just skip\\xa0it. Just be safe, you know?” And\\xa0I was like, “Yes, that’s what I thought, but I wanted to hear you say it, so now I’ll tell other people not to drink ever while they’re pregnant. Thank you.” Huh! Good. That’s done with. And then… You know, and then I asked, like, a little more lenient of a friend. I’m like… “Hey, what are your thoughts on drinking wine while you’re pregnant?” She’s like, “A glass a week is fine. Like, that’s probably fine.” I’m like, “That’s better. That makes sense.\\xa0That’s good. You’re smart.” And then… Then you ask your kind of biggest dirtbag, deadbeat friend, you know? She’s like, “Once you start getting, like, fucked up, stop drinking.” I’m like… Mm-hmm! No, I haven’t even wanted… wine. That’s how I know this baby is not mine. This baby is a lie. No, it’s mine, and… I’m pretty sure the guy\\xa0who got me pregnant is my husband ’cause I got married, yay! ♪ To the luckiest boy in the world ♪ I married a chef because I’m a fucking\\xa0genius. Right? Do you guys like food? That’s what he makes. Yeah. I love it. Marrying a chef, it’s like a little on-the-nose for me. It’s kind of like Snoop marrying weed. I love him. It’s real. Um… The proposal was wack. Uh… He proposed to me in the morning. That’s, like, when people in a nursing home\\xa0get engaged. Like… Not, like, at sunrise. I was still asleep. I was sleeping, ',\n",
       "  'and I sleep like I’m still\\xa0in the womb. Earplugs, eye mask… my mom’s legs around my shoulders. Like… You know? Recreate. Every morning, I’m born and… So I’m… in the womb, and he comes in, and I just took one ear plug out. I was like… And he kind of threw the ring box\\xa0at me, and he goes, “I got you this.” And I open it, and… And he goes, “Do you want me to get down on one\\xa0knee?” and I was like, “I guess not.” And then I went back to sleep. That’s the truth.\\xa0That’s a real ass proposal, though. That’s like a real… You know? ‘Cause, like, in movies and TV shows, the guy\\xa0always gets down on one knee, right? And the girl’s always shocked. “I didn’t even know you liked me! I’m still on Bumble. Like, this is…” Like, you didn’t talk about… That’s a very\\xa0big decision… to not talk about. I don’t know any\\xa0girl who got engaged that way. I’m from New York. All my girlfriends are from New York. We get married late there. When you\\xa0get engaged at 40, it’s like, “Whoa, teen bride! Like, slow… Slow it down. Get to know him.” I think there are only two reasons you should get down on one knee if you’re a guy. If you’re a player in the NFL… and to eat my pussy. Those are the two… Two reasons. I mean, if the guy you’re with gets, like, synchronized swans to dance\\xa0to Bruno Mars, you\\xa0know? He’s gay. That’s a gay guy. And, look, we all have a friend married to a\\xa0gay guy. We do. We do.\\xa0You’re probably here with a couple right now. And they’re like, “Talk about Meghan Markle more.” We’ve had that experience, right? When you meet the couple for the first time, and then they leave, and then a couple of your friends, you’re taking each other’s\\xa0temperature. You’re like… “Jeff was nice, right?” “Yeah. Yeah. Jeff was cool, yeah.” “You said he’s a costume designer. He’s a… Yeah.” And then finally someone’s like, “Is Jeff gay?” You’re like, “Jeff is gay! Yes!” And we all laugh at our friend. “Hee-hee, she’s married to a gay guy.” But you know\\xa0what? Someone with hyperemesis who’s five months\\xa0pregnant, you know who sounds like it would be fun to be married to right now? Fucking Jeff. Get on one knee for Jeff. I think… I don’t want to jinx it. I think I don’t have to be a bridesmaid anymore. Yeah, I think I’ve done… I’m not making no new friends. Everybody got married. I was the last one. ‘Cause when you get in your late\\xa030s, there’s just no dignity to it,\\xa0you know? It’s like me in a Grecian gown with my aging cleavage and like… a Coachella flower halo. I’m just like… Just hoping I’m not the bridesmaid with the biggest arm, you know? I’m like… I hold my arm out. ‘Cause people used to get married in their early 20s. You had a little 20-year-old bridesmaid\\xa0arm. You were\\xa0holding your champagne\\xa0like, “It’s heavy!” Now it’s just a sea of turkey legs, just… Looks like the defensive line for the Bears are in the wedding. I really respect you guys for coming out because if you follow me on Instagram, you’re probably like, “Is this bitch in the\\xa0hospital? Is she gonna be there?” Yeah. I made it. I… I’ve been hospitalized a couple of times since I’ve been pregnant with hyperemesis and… The very first time was about a month ago,\\xa0and… I was throwing up for about five hours when I… was taken to the hospital. The doctor came in, and he explained to me and my sister and my husband, who were are all\\xa0in the room. He said, “You’re going to be here for at least five\\xa0hours getting liquids.” And without\\xa0skipping a beat, my husband\\xa0said to my sister, “Okay, cool, because',\n",
       "  ' I saw a place where you\\xa0can paint pottery nearby.” You guys are like, “Is he gay?” So my sister didn’t even,\\xa0like, check in with me if it was cool that they left me. As soon\\xa0as he said “pottery,” they just left. And I was like, “I’ll be here.” And about an hour and a half later, my sister rushed back in the room, and she\\xa0said, “Okay, listen. Be nice to him about\\xa0what he painted.” I’m like… “Okay.” She’s like, “I’m serious. He worked really hard on it.” “Okay.” She goes… “And it’s not very flattering.” I’m like, “What?” But my husband’s brain is a little different. ‘Cause you go to these places, you usually\\xa0paint a teddy bear or a jewelry box, you\\xa0know, but my husband decided to… to paint a plate… which he would use as a canvas… to paint me. And I’m going to show you the picture. I think it’s important for you guys\\xa0to see the picture. Um… And I want to show you this, and I\\xa0want you to know that there were no qualifiers before he showed me this picture. He was sure it was pretty good. This is the picture that he painted. I was in the hospital, guys. What is… I wanted to go, “What’s with my chin on my\\xa0neck?” I look like Trump. Like, I look… I couldn’t say any of this to him, okay? Get rid of it. People are leaving. This is upsetting. This is an upsetting image. I mean… I had to comfort him. My husband is a really great sport. You know? He really is. I keep messing\\xa0with him. Like, you know, I’ve had a tough pregnancy, so… the other day, I was like, “Babe, this is kind of too hard for me. I don’t think I can do it.” And he’s like, “What do you mean?” And I was like… “What do you think I mean? I think I… I need to get an abortion.” And this was his response. He went… “Really?” I was like, “No! What?” I’m going to announce it on Instagram, and then I’m going to be like, “Actually, forget it. I don’t like it. I’m tired. I don’t like it.” Thank God that was his response, you know? What if he’d been like, “Cool. I’ll warm up\\xa0the car.” I knew from the beginning that my husband’s brain was a little different\\xa0than mine. Um, and about… I have to start this over ’cause I really want to get this right. Because I love him very much. And… My husband was diagnosed with what used to be called Asperger’s. He has autism\\xa0spectrum disorder. He’s on the spectrum. And… there were some signs early on, like… we went for a walk about a year ago, and I fell. And kinda nine out of ten people would go, “Oh, my God! Are you okay?” Right? Maybe more like ten out of ten people. “Oh, my God! Are you okay?” But instead, my husband went… He kind of froze and became a lighthouse, opening and closing his mouth, just… And I remember lying on the ground looking up at him, and I wasn’t mad. I just thought, “Huh!” A lot of “huh” moments, you know? And once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me how funny it was because all of the characteristics that make it\\xa0clear that he’s on the spectrum are all\\xa0of the reasons that I fell madly in love\\xa0with him. That’s the truth. He says whatever is on his mind. He keeps it so real, you know? He doesn’t\\xa0care about social norms or what you\\xa0expect him to say or do. You know, if I say to him, like, “Does this look like shit?” He’ll go, “Yeah. You have a lot of other clothes. Why don’t you wear those?” I’m like… “Okay.” But he can also make me feel more beautiful than anyone ever has\\xa0my whole\\xa0life. Yeah, it’s true. And he can’t lie. Is that the dream man, a guy who can’t lie? But that also means that he can’t lie for\\xa0me. Whic',\n",
       "  \"h is an essential part of any relationship. We’re friends with this couple, and they broke up, and the guy started dating a new girl pretty soon after, and we happened to be at\\xa0the party where they got together, so I didn’t rush to tell the\\xa0ex-girlfriend what happened. So a couple of months later, we had dinner with her, and she was like, “And, you know, at\\xa0that party, that’s when they got together.” And I was like… “No! It’s not possible.” And Chris goes… “No, you remember.” “No. No, I don’t.” “Yeah, remember? ‘Cause you said, ‘Oh, my God, he’s\\xa0leaving with her.'” “Thank you, Chris! Thank you. I guess I forgot about that.” Also, one of the the signs of autism is you don’t make sort of the… appropriate facial expression for the\\xa0occasion you’re at. So we were gonna go on a red carpet together for the first time, and we were practicing his\\xa0smiles, you know, and we didn’t land on one that we were in love with. So we were out of time, so I said, “Just… This is what I do.\\xa0Just think about something you love,\\xa0you know?” And he loves the ocean, so… So we went out there and it worked, but it worked too well. ‘Cause in all the pictures, I’m doing my normal bullshit, and he\\xa0was like… I noticed. I was like, “A pond. Just like\\xa0you’re glancing at a pond. Pull it back.” It’s exciting being pregnant. It’s not all bad. The best part about it is not getting your period. Yeah. That’s the silver uterine lining, if you want to look for one. That’s nice because,\\xa0you know, what I realized, right before I got pregnant, I\\xa0noticed… how ashamed… we’ve all been made to feel about getting\\xa0our period… our whole lives. Like we choose it, you\\xa0know? Like, “Can’t kick my bleeding habit, you know? I just want it. I want to do it.” It’s supposed to be, you know, a secret. The second you get it, your mom goes, “You’re a woman now. And that’s disgusting. Never let anyone know of your filthy secret.” And you’re like, “Okay. I’m 12. I’m ready to handle this.” This is my Rainbow Brite lunch box. ♪ Rainbow Brite Stars are shining bright ♪ And it is. That’s the most embarrassing\\xa0thing that could possibly happen to you as a kid, that someone knows you have your period, or they see you have your period. At that age, for men, the most\\xa0embarrassing thing is unwanted erections,\\xa0right? But then they grow up and show them to\\xa0everyone. Maybe that’s what we should do. I don’t know. Call a coworker into your office. “Carl… Psst. Come in here. Close the door.” “Carl, you’re getting very sleepy.” All this talk about dick pics, how about a tamp pic? You up? If you’re still in a position where you’re getting dick pics, ladies, I have a\\xa0suggestion for you. When you get a dick\\xa0pic… send back… a dick pic. You go, “Oh, I’m sorry. I thought we were exchanging our favorite\\xa0dick pics. Dick for dick, pic for pic, no? I thought…” Why are we made to feel so ashamed of a natural bodily function that ultimately brings life, you know? It’s like… If you\\xa0forget a tampon, you have to bum one from\\xa0somebody. What we all do is, first, you look around… like you’re going to say something racist, just like… And whatever race you thought I meant, that’s your problem. And… Then you kind of lean in, and we don’t even say the whole sentence. We kind of go… “Does anybody have a…” “Tampon?” What is this? What’s the claw? That’s how disgusted we are with ourselves. “Does anyone have a tampon?” And I notice myself do it. I was in a gym locker room. Thank you.\\xa0And… And there were a bunch of wome\",\n",
       "  'n in there, and I… And this woman across the locker room with so much confidence was like, “Oh, yeah, I do. What size?” And, like, obviously, I know there are different sizes of\\xa0tampons, but I’ve never been confronted… …with that question before, you know? She’s like, “Yeah, what’s the circumference of your pussy hole? Grande or venti? What are we plugging, bitch? I’ve got Pilates. What is it?” Then all the other women in the locker room kinda lean in to hear… …my answer, you know? I’m just like… “I don’t know. Do you have, like, a… super Grand Canyon? I don’t know. Just throw me a futon mattress. I’ll just kind of squat over it.” My vagina is going to get bigger, I heard. Whoo! Can’t wait. Take up more space. Lean in! It’s already grown. It just grows over the years. I know because, I mean, when I was younger, I could put a Tic Tac in\\xa0there and then just walk around all day. At night, I swear it would still be\\xa0in the same\\xa0place, just… Whoop! Now… if I have a yeast infection, which I do… and I try to put one of those Monistat\\xa0suppositories in, it just falls right on\\xa0the floor. Whoop! Be careful. They’re very slippery. I do. I have a yeast infection. I’m gonna address it ’cause I have to do the pinch. You guys know the pinch. Ladies, just a quick, little pinch. But I’m really excited about this. We don’t even need tampons anymore. There’s a new invention. – You guys know what I’m talking about? – DivaCup! No, not the DivaCup. That is terrifying. Um… The DivaCup… Do you know what it is? It’s like this little cup you store in the back of your vagina, and it collects… and at the end of the day, you pull\\xa0it out and you kinda Kill Bill. Just kind of… No! It’s a lot. It’s too much for me. I respect you if you can handle the DivaCup. Such a confident name. “I’m a Diva.” No. It’s more exciting than the DivaCup. It’s a new invention called THINX. Yes. Yeah, you don’t need a tampon. They’re just these underwear that you just bleed into. Which I guess… makes me a fucking inventor. Ah! Who knew? Should I go on Shark Tank? “Sharks…” Did anyone have a mom like me who didn’t\\xa0really trust tampons and made them only wear a\\xa0pad? Right? And millennials, if you don’t know what a pad is, congratulations, and… A pad is kind of a foot-long diaper that you… …coil betwixt your legs, and… just kinda waddle around all day wearing it, just… Crunch! Crunch! Kinda always sounds like there’s a killer right behind you. They were great. Yeah. Little adhesive wings. They’d always stick right to your pubes. It was a treat. It was a real treat. Sorry you missed it. I’m sorry. Millennials… pubes… Anybody remember pubes? I miss my mom’s bush. Did you guys see your mom’s bush growing up? It’s kind of comforting, right? The first time you see it, I’ll never forget. I remember I walked in the bathroom to say\\xa0goodnight. I was like, “Mom! Oh. Hi, Mom. Good night.” I remember Mom’s bush. I also had one of those moms… who told me, “You only have to shave\\xa0up to\\xa0your knee.” Right? “Just shave up to your knee.” I’d say, “Mom, I’m pretty hairy up…” “No! The knee.” “Okay.” I’d be at the community pool. People are like… “Why is Amy wearing wool shorts?” But I have to give it up for my mom. She made me so confident. She just straight lied to me as a kid. It’s tough to say “confident”… as a woman, you know? You put on TV. We see all these gorgeous women. We have to compete with what’s her face, the Mother of Dragons. What’s her name? – Khaleesi! – Kris Jenner. It',\n",
       "  '’s just… It’s tough. It’s tough out there. No, I love the Kardashians. The Kardashians are so confident, they confuse me about my own confidence. So before I was pregnant, I was kind of like feeling myself one day, and I bought lingerie. Like… the real shit. Like… the, you know, fishnets, and then… like the pulley system\\xa0here. You know? Thought they would’ve updated that technology, but it’s still a pulley system, and then, you\\xa0know, the boost… Whatever it’s called. And… You know, I went. I paid for it. I tried it on at home, you know, where I\\xa0could take my own life, and… In the safety of home, and… I tried it on, and I was kind of ready to blow my own mind. I kind of sidled up to the mirror, and I\\xa0check myself out, and I was like, “Oh. This isn’t for everybody. Hmm. Okay.” I looked like I should have been on Law & Order, like, “He went that way.” My fishnets looked like they’d caught an actual fish. It was… It was pretty confusing. It’s tough to say “confident” as a girl. I don’t know what I’m having. I hope it’s a girl. Um… But really just because it’s such a scary\\xa0time for men. Such a scary time. Men, thank you so much for leaving your houses\\xa0tonight. I just… God. First responders,\\xa0just… so brave. I don’t know if men know how scared we are as women all the time. Like, one in three of us will be assaulted at some point in our lives. If you’re a woman of color, it’s even more than that. If you’re a trans woman, forget it. At night in New York, if I take the subway\\xa0at night, I will run home. Women, we run home. Not for the cardio. It’s true. When you walk to your\\xa0car in a dark parking lot, what do you ladies do? We do the little\\xa0makeshift brass\\xa0knuckle with our key, right? I don’t know what our plan is with that key in our knuckle. “Oh, no, you don’t! Ahh! Not on my watch. Boop-boop!” I mean… There was a study done, and it said that women mostly fear violence. That’s our number one fear. And the same study showed that men’s\\xa0number one fear… was ridicule. Oh… Yeah, God! I’m so sorry. I didn’t know you guys were going\\xa0through that. It must be so hard for you. Do you guys run home? Because you’re afraid of somebody telling a\\xa0little jokey about you? I think that we need to start from scratch, you know? I’m so grateful to this new generation of women that came along and\\xa0they’re like, “Hey, have you been getting\\xa0sexually harassed like this your whole\\xa0lives?” And we’re like, “Oh, yeah!” And they’re like, “Yeah. You wanna do something about that?” And we’re like, “Oh, yeah. That’s a very good idea.” They’re like, “Yeah.” And we’re like, “Oh.” We’re so used to it, you know? You’re at work, and you’re like, “I have to make every guy think that we also might fuck and do a good\\xa0job.” It’s not fair. It’s not fair to men either. You guys are raised with so much pressure to be so masculine at such a young age. It’s bullshit. It sucks. It’s like a six-year-old kid crying. “Stop crying, you little pussy.” We toughen them up at a young age so they\\xa0don’t get made fun of, and then, as little\\xa0girls, you’re in school with these boys, and when a little boy is mean to you or he teases you, what does everybody say? – He likes you. – “He likes you.” Ooh! You’re like, “He knocked my books out of my hands.” “Whoo! Looks like somebody has a little boyfriend at\\xa0school. That’s a good thing.” And you’re like, “Oh. That’s a good thing! Okay! I’m the luckiest girl in school.” “He pushed me down the stairs.” “You’re going\\xa0to prom!” “Prom!” Righ',\n",
       "  't? Then we grow up and we all have\\xa0friends who were like, “Why do I only date\\xa0assholes?” ‘Cause you’ve been trained to do that since you were a toddler. You know, we have friends who are like, “You should see us when we’re alone. He’s still really mean to me, but it’s not as embarrassing.” It doesn’t occur to us to be with someone\\xa0who’s kind until we’re, like, almost dead, you know? I mean, who cares?\\xa0We’re about to lose our rights, anyway. Right, ladies? Take ’em. I’m sick of it. Give me my bonnet. Give me my cape. I’m ready. Done washing my hair all the\\xa0time. I mean, look at us making decisions about our own bodies. Who do we think we are? Men? Come on! Decisions are hard. Rights feel heavy. I want people who know better than anyone making the decisions about my body. I want to call up Mitch McConnell and be\\xa0like, “Girl! My discharge is brown, baby girl. What should I do? Mitch! Chuck Grassley, I’ve got cramps. Am I ovulating, queen? Lindsey mammo-Graham, feel this. What you think? You guys know.” Maybe some of you heard I got arrested in\\xa0October. Thank you. Thank you. God’s work. Um… I went down to DC to get arrested. The different news outlets wrote about it. Like, “Schumer’s been detained,” like I was just on a walking tour of the\\xa0Washington Monument. But I went down there to oppose Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Thank you, sisters. Men, you can clap too. Spoiler alert. It didn’t go our way. The whole way down, I was really nervous about getting\\xa0arrested. I’ve been arrested before, obviously, but… But I was obsessed with the fear of being\\xa0hungry. You know, while I was locked up. So… It probably would have been like that before I was pregnant, but that just\\xa0doubled it, so the whole way down… And, you know, we get down there, and… it was\\xa0really intense and really emotional, and… We were gonna get arrested on the Capitol steps, but they barricaded those, so we all rush into the Hart Building, where the senators’ offices are, and we all flood in this hallway, and, you know, the banners are flying and the\\xa0Capitol police are closing in, and we know we’re about to be arrested, and everyone’s chanting, “No justice, no peace,” and, “We believe survivors. We believe survivors.” And I know we’re about to be arrested, so I am… ramming snacks in my mouth. I am… Everyone’s, “We Believe,” and I’m… And the Capitol police are looking at me like, “What the fuck?” I’m like… Just Cookie Monster, crumbling shit on my face. I got arrested with my friend, Emily Ratajkowski, who’s a supermodel, like gorgeous, you know. And she’s in this hot outfit,\\xa0and she’s like, “We believe\\xa0survivors,” and I’m in a Department of Sanitation shirt, and I’m like… “Ahh!” And some people criticized me. They were\\xa0like, “That was irresponsible. You’re pregnant.” And I was like, “That’s why I went down there.” I want to be able to tell this\\xa0kid I did everything I could. You know? And D.C., I heard, has the best cocaine, so… My friend said it’s fine. Uh… A baby. Guys, what the fuck am I doing? We have no idea what we’re doing. We have some books at home, and every week, there’s a terrifying video saying what’s\\xa0going on in the baby’s\\xa0development. “This week, your baby is growing fur and eating you from the inside.” I’m glad I found a good partner,\\xa0you know? Like, he’s solid as hell. Yeah. I just… I didn’t have the energy for dating anymore, like… Remember when you hook up with someone the first time? Do you remember you used to undress each other? Know',\n",
       "  ' what I’m talking about? They do that in movies. So you’re like… It’s always hard. In movies… But you’re\\xa0like, okay, a braided belt, and there is\\xa0the silver thing. And then, oh, a button fly. I’ll just kind of yank it. And your sock. Am I in fucking retail? Take your own shit\\xa0off. My back hurts. I was in bed with my husband the other night. I was holding our dog, and my husband just took off my underwear. And I looked over at him and I was like, “Oh, no.” That’s crazy, you know. He was kind of like, “Okay.” Like he didn’t give a shit too much, you\\xa0know. And we’re lying there, and I’m like… “Can you put my underwear back on?” Such sad foreshadowing watching him, like, dress my lifeless body. We were at the gynecologist a couple months ago, and I asked, “Is it safe to have sex while pregnant?” And she was like, “Yes, it is safe to have sex through the\\xa0whole pregnancy.” And I was like, “We’ll be seeking a second opinion.” That’s fucking… I was trying to signal her, you know. “Hey. Do you think it’s safe… for us to have sex? Do you think it would probably kill the baby\\xa0and we shouldn’t do it?” She’s like, “No, it’s safe the whole time.” I was like, “Okay. Okay.” Do you want me to come to your house to tell your husband he can fuck you? ‘Cause people tell you. You’re like, wow, that was fast. “Last time we saw you, you were single,\\xa0Amy, and you already don’t want to fuck your husband?” I usually do, but I have hyperemesis. And you know everyone says, “When you get married, get ready to stop having sex.” And we were like, “Not us. We’re fucking for life,” you know. Now he, like, touches my shoulder on the\\xa0couch, and I’m like, “Can I help you? I’m over here. You’re over there.” The spontaneity is over. Thank God. You know, when you’re first falling in love, like you might always\\xa0have sex. Every time you pee, you’ve gotta make sure you clean the toilet paper out of your\\xa0pussy. Every time you pee. Every time. That is over. I have, like, half a roll\\xa0of Charmin in there\\xa0right now. Yeah. I’m psyched to be done. I am. Especially dating someone new, you know. And I’m glad I married someone, he’s my age. We’re the same age, so… You know, we both grew up without Internet porn. That’s a huge deal, right? Like, you know, now I feel like you can’t fuck a millennial without them being like, “Can you dress like an emoji?” You’re like, “No!” What the fuck? No. And there’s so many different types\\xa0of porn. It’s crazy. One of the biggest searches is “gag porn.” Have you heard of that? That’s where the girl gags on the guy’s\\xa0penis because it’s too darn big. I personally never had the plesh. I just wanted to remind you that\\xa0I’ve never struggled with it, even though… You remember the size of my mouth, right? Do you remember how big my mouth is? Just like a tiny bow. You could put… Okay, yeah. You remember. Gag porn. Like that one… That one is strange to me. Like you’re\\xa0clicking on all these\\xa0different windows. Nothing, nothing. And then a girl’s like… And you’re like, “Mmm, wait a minute. What have we here?” Maximize screen. “Okay. Okay.” If you’re into gag porn, you should’ve\\xa0been living at my house the last five months. You’d be hard as a\\xa0rock. Something else I won’t miss, and this is my PSA… to men. A lot of men don’t really understand how to put themselves inside you. Not really. Even missionary. They’re… You know, they’re… It’s the wrong hole,\\xa0or not a hole. You’re like, “You have to use an existing hole, sir.” You’re not going to co',\n",
       "  'nfuse my body into making\\xa0a new hole. But most guys can figure it out, but you\\xa0really realize that they don’t understand where our hole goes when they’re behind\\xa0you, right? ‘Cause during some sex, it’s always I don’t know whose suggestion to not\\xa0look at your face anymore. “How about you turn around?” “Oh, okay.” You look back over the shoulder, they’re like, “Nope!” You’re like, “Okay. I’ll be here.” That’s when you know because there’s a whole population of men who, once they get\\xa0back there behind you, they’ll kneel back there and just wait. Dick in the wind. And you’re up here, like… “Uh… We’re rolling.” And you realize that he’s waiting for you… who’s on all fours… …to reach back… and put him inside you. You’re like, “Oh, you want me to…? Oh, Okay. Uh… Yeah. I’ll just use my head as, like, a kickstand, just… Yeah. No, it makes sense. I have the\\xa0better angle here. You want to back the garage up to the car, is what…?” Okay. Nope, it’s fine. You’ve had a long day making more money than\\xa0me. Here I come.” Luckily, my husband does not have that problem. Because… of that joke. I know I talk so much shit about, uh, my pregnancy, and it has not been easy, but we’re so fucking excited, and I do\\xa0feel really lucky that I was able to get\\xa0pregnant. Yeah. So I… was single, you know, most of my life, and felt pretty happy. I love my family and friends, and I feel really satisfied with work, and… kind of had accepted that, you know? And then I just happened… to meet this guy, and if you’re out there\\xa0and you’re dating and you’re just thinking, “Why can’t I meet the right one?” It’s\\xa0not that you haven’t met the right one yet. I wish someone had told me this. It’s not\\xa0that you haven’t\\xa0met the right one yet. It’s just… that you have to wait… for them to get tired. No one told me, right? Because men in their\\xa020s and their 30s are just running\\xa0around. And then their late 30s, they’re like, “Oh, God! Phew. Oh, God!” And that’s when you come along and you\\xa0go… “Come on.” And they’re like, “Where are we going?” And you’re like… “We’re going to sit on the couch and watch\\xa0Bravo till we die.” Thank you so much, Chicago. I love you. I realized how ashamed I was of my period. Excuse me. The baby. Right now, every fart’s a gamble. Fart roulette. My money’s on brown. Um… So they’re flashing a light that says that I\\xa0need to get some makeup because I’m\\xa0sweating like a monster. All right. You guys can only see that I’m sweating here, but if there was a camera in my asshole… This is all my hair I bought. There are these two people right in the front row here. I’m not going to look at them, but these two people. And like… They’re, like, truly horrified by everything I’m saying. I’m like, “Did you guys think you were seeing Godspell?” Okay. I promise it’s not going to get any better,\\xa0you guys. Your email address will not be published.

       " ['Hey, it’s Andrew Santino, and here I am in my hometown, Chicago, Illinois, where I’m shooting my stand-up comedy special, but before I do, I want to take you around my city, and I want to show you the gems that people don’t talk about, locals-only type of stuff. Hey, excuse me. Can I get a ride? No. Okay. Fair enough. Chicago. Well, I have a meeting, and I don’t know you. It’s fine. I get that. Why should I even… You know, that’s an odd question to ask. You’re right. Now that I think about it… In the city here, with all the crime and everything, – just hop in and get a ride? You’re right. Best city in the world, baby… Chicago. Boom, a local spot… Willis Tower, on the corner, of course, of Jackson and Wacker. Now, Jackson and Wacker is famous ’cause of Andrew Jackson and because people used to get whacked. Right below me, the Chicago Pond, a beautiful piece of water. People swim in here. Olympics train in this thing. Jordan actually was inside the mold when they molded him. They cracked it, pulled him out, reassembled it. Boom. Here we are at The Wiener’s Circle, bro… The best hot dog in Chicago. And they treat me like I’m from here. Come on in. Hey, let me get a hot dog, ladies. How do you want it? You know how I want it, man. What, up your ass or down your fucking throat? Come on, order correctly, pussy lips. Let’s get it together. Before I continue this tour, I’m gonna get a drink. Ah, double fisting. Chi Town is a drinking city. Everybody knows that. Ah, beers for the crew, beers for the crew, beers for the crew. Cheers, you guys. Cheers. Okay, we had more planned. We’re never gonna get to it. You want to know more about Chicago, Google it, okay? Enjoy the special. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my grandson… Andrew Santino. We did it. We did it. Yes. Chicago, Illinois, my hometown, how are you? Yes. Crazy. That’s my grandmother, man. Yeah, that’s the best thing in the world. My grandmother brought me up. Give it up for Mary Garrity, man. Cheers. Cheers to you guys. Cheers. My grandfather, who passed away, used to say… A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, ‘What is that?’ And she’d say, ‘It’s water.’ And he said, ‘I’m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.’ So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. We’re here. I’m so happy to be back in this city. I’m back home. It’s amazing. I’m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, that… Ah, Chicago. It’s Chicago. ‘A’ s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? ‘A’s, ahs, T, Ds, everyone’s racist. It’s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, ‘You know what? Why don’t you suck my dick?’ And the other guy goes, ‘Pfft! You suck my dick.’ And I was like, ‘Hey, suck each other’s dicks, man.’ That would’ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, ‘You motherfucker.’ Finish him. Finish him. We got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that ’cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, ‘Suck my dick.’ We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like it’s a bad thing. It’s the best thing in the world. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, ‘Hey! ‘Suck my dick, please, if you have time. ‘If you don’t, it’s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.’ I’m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. It’s where my family is from. My family’s still here. It’s great to come home, see my parents. They’re getting older, which is weird. That’s a hard thing, to see your parents get older… Like, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, ‘Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.’ Like, my mom was like, ‘Well, I’m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?’ And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, ‘Eat steak, watch porn.’ I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. They’re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. They’re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I don’t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs ’cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, ‘I’ m not gonna fuck up two of them. ‘We can’t do that. One’s good. We’ll fuck up one. That’s okay.’ We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. She’s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat religious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? They’re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, ‘Now I lay me down to sleep.’ Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I ‘d say,’ Now I lay me down to sleep. ‘I pray the Lord my soul to keep, ‘and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.’ I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thing… for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? I’m six. I’m gonna die in the middle of the night, and God’',\n",
       "  's gonna leave my body, take my soul, but be like, ‘Body’ s good. Leave the body. It’s fine. Leave it.’ What’s going on? Crazy person. I love her. She’s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think I’m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, ‘Heads, yes, tails, no.’ I’d flip it, I’d get tails, and I’d go, ‘Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let ‘s see what happens.’ He didn’t beat me, never won. That’s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, that’s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, ‘You don’ t lock the doors inside of the house. ‘If you’ re locking the doors inside of the house, it means you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing.’ Yeah, that’s why we lock the doors. Don’t come in here. I’m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. That’s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house must’ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. He’s like, ‘You know what? That’s it. I’m gonna put locks inside the house.’ She ‘s like,’ Michael, what are you doing? ‘We have locks on the outside of the house ‘to keep criminals from coming inside. There’s no criminals inside of this house.’ Yes, there are, Karen, and they’re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen. Anyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. It’s okay. It’s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. It’s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, that’s a big thing. My mom is like, ‘How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?’ It’s like, ‘Yeah, it’s better than this. That’s why I’m out there. What are you talking about?’ It’s always better. It’s always better. It is. There’s a lot of stuff that isn’t better, but the weather’s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the ‘feels like’ meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guy’s like, ‘It’s 62. Feels like 68.’ That’s Midwest hope. That’s hope circulating in your body. It’s the greatest lie ever told. Who’s the ‘feels like’ guy? I want that job. If that’s a job, I want it tonight. I’ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The ‘feels like’ guy… Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, it’s 62 on the barometer. We’re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? How’s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man. It’s nice, really nice out. It’s crazy, man, ’cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when I come back, you’re never surprised. Like, you’re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I don’t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I don’t give a shit. They’re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. They’re terrible. They’re terrible people. I feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. They’re never not dying. They’re always dying. There’s, like, a week when it’s like, ‘We might make it,’ and that’s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, ’cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. I’m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy ’cause I feel bad for him. I know what he’s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And I’ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, ‘Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don ‘t have a calendar.’ You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. I’m sure there’s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. That’s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, ‘Oh, let’ s get the fuck out of here. ‘It’ s cold. Let’s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.’ But I don’t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at all… I really don’t. I don’t. I don’t feel bad for them. Some people are like, ‘Oh, that’s kind of mean.’ I don’t give a shit. I don’t give a shit, ’cause I live amongst these people, and they’re rude. They’re rude. You know why they’re rude? ‘Cause they made it. They’re at the promised land. It’s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach. I came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless guy, said, ‘Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?’ Okay? I’m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, ‘What’s in it?’ And I looked at him, and I said, ‘Tomorrow.’ Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. You’re cock-blocking me, man. I’m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough',\n",
       "  '. Who are you? But I like it. It’s my second home. This is my first home. L.A.’s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. It’s kind of like up here. It’s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. I’ve ever lived in in my life. It’s safe. It’s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? I’m not gay, Dad, but… I’m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. I’ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that. They’re people just like you and me. There’s nothing different. There’s nothing different about that neighborhood. It’s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. I’ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And that’s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I don’t know. It’s a thing. It’s an underbelly thing. It’s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and I’m okay with that. It’s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But I’ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now I’m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and I’m like, ‘All right, you couldn’t handle it, dude. ‘You couldn’ t handle it. Too tight, too tight. ‘Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.’ Couldn’t have it. That’s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. We’re stupid people by nature. We’re just dumb. We don’t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, ‘Men are dumb.’ I don’t care. You think I care you think I’m dumb? I don’t give a shit. I know I’m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. That’s what you guys do all day. It’s like, ‘I heard he was with her, but then she was’… And we just walk around like… It’s great. It’s fantastic. I don’t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and I’m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, it’s a little bit different, ’cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go like… Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. Hey, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, ‘Hey, hey.’ We don’t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that I’m not a pussy. I go, ‘Hey, what’ s up? We good, we good? ‘We’re good. I’m good with the black guy. ‘In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. ‘We’ re good. We got one. We’re good, we’re good. We got him.’ I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. There’s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you can’t do that in my neighborhood ’cause it means something totally different… and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I don’t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender… Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didn’t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. They’re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroom’s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I ‘m like,’ Aah! ‘There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. ‘I don’ t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they ‘ll do?’ Who do you think you are? It was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And I’m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I don’t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. It’s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, ‘Hi, our line’ s too long. ‘Do you think me… Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?’ I know that’s a stereotypical impression. I don’t give a shit. That’s real. ‘Can we cut?’ That’s real. And every asshole in line is like, ‘Yeah, go ahead.’ Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and I’m tired of that shit, ’cause we can’t use your bathrooms. Guys can’t use girls’ bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why can’t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, ‘Well, you pee on the seat.’ Do we? I don’t. I don’t pee on the seat. If you live with someone that pees on the seat, it’s ’cause they hate your fucking guts. They’re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking assho',\n",
       "  'le. He’s saying something to you. That’s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk in the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and it’s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. That’s amazing. It’s ridiculous. To me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from men’s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesn’t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We don’t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of men’s bathrooms in bars because they shouldn’t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, ’cause a girl can’t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I don’t know if it’s this way or that way. I don’t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldn’t be stalls in men’s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? You’re gonna poop at the bar? You’re gonna poop here? Steve, you’re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that we’re at, you’re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at the… Who are your friends? Who’s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? You’re gross. You’re a gross human. You don’t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-up… like a full-grown adult. If you’re pooping at the bar that I’m at and I see you doing that, I’m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, ‘Hey, there’ s a guy pooping here ‘wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He ‘s pooping right now.’ And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? ‘Cause you pooped here, Mike. What’s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, ‘Go home, you pig. You make me sick.’ Unbelievable, man, how we prote… We protect the bathrooms like they’re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like it’s something important. It’s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and you’re like, ‘Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? It’s locked.’ They’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.’ It’s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. It’s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. You’re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen? There’s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, ‘Hey, what’s up, you guys?’ Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real. It’s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didn’t want to talk about anything that’s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, it’s the late show, I’ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. I’m proud to be from where I’m from, okay? I’m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. I’m proud to be from the United States of America. I’m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. It’s unfortunate as fuck. It’s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isn’t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So don’t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. That’s it. That’s it. Good. I’m a… I’m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. ‘Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. You’re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? You’re gross. You’re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, ‘Ah, we ran out of time. ‘No, put the genitals on the outside. ‘It doesn’ t matter. ‘No one’ s gonna see. Who cares? ‘Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.’ It’s phenomenal. Every day we’ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, ‘Ah, tricked them. ‘We tricked them again. We got away with murder.’ I don’t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I just… Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it? It’s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. That’s all he’s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonai',\n",
       "  'r at the bar. You ‘re like,’ Well, well, I work for an investment firm downtown.’ But what you’re really saying is, like, ‘I want to put my body in your body. I’d like to put my body inside of your body.’ That’s all it is. You’re not that cool. You’re just trying to put some of your body in someone’s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? That’s it. Think about that… That’s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl I’m the guy that you want to do things with. Think about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. That’s it. There’s really nothing going on, just a lot of… Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They don’t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women like… What are you selling? She doesn’t know. You can’t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the pack… on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon. It was like… Everything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I would’ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That would’ve been amazing. Right? The first guy that’s like… That’s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were like… What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. It’s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddy’s an artist, and I was like, ‘I want a fucking papa bear ‘with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, ‘and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls ‘and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.’ And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing. The Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. It’s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You can’t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Where’s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. I’m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Don’t clap for that. Please don’t clap for that shit ’cause it eggs her on, and I don’t need that. No, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she ‘s like,’ What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?’ We didn’t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didn’t really get into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, ‘Well, whatever you want to do.’ She was like, ‘Do you want to have a bachelor party?’ And I was like, ‘I don’ t know. ‘Like, I do stand-up for a living, ‘so, like, it’ s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.’ I was like, ‘No, I’m good.’ You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, ‘That’s good enough for me.’ I was like, ‘You can do a bachelorette party. Don ‘t feel like you can’t.’ She was like, ‘Are you cool with it?’ I was like, ‘I promise. I’m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you ‘re good. Do it.’ She was like, ‘Okay, trust me. It ‘ll be classy.’ That’s some dumb shit. Girls are like, ‘It’ s gonna be classy. ‘The bachelorette party… It’s gonna be cla… I promise. We won’t be as crazy as you think we’re gonna be.’ She was like, ‘We’ re going to Northern California ‘to a vineyard. We ‘re gonna do wine tasting.’ So in girls’ brains, they think that we think that that’s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know they’re not wine tasting. I know they’re blacking out on wine. I know they’re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town like… I know. I know what you’re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunks… trying to pretend like… We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. It’s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, that’s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends. See, ’cause here’s the thing about bachelorette parties. I’m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. I’m sure you’re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then you’re a piece of shit. Then you’re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, ‘Look at us, penises everywhere. ‘Penises on our body. ‘Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. ‘These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. ‘These are dick glasses. They’re dick shoes. ‘Look at it. It comes. This one comes. ‘It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.’ What’s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. It’s unbelievable… Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at night… they’re just like, ‘Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.’ Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, ‘Cocks, cocks on my head.’ You psycho. That’s where guys beat you. That’s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor',\n",
       "  ' party where they’re like, ‘Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let ‘s go.’ I put one on like… ‘Come on, let’ s go. ‘Get mine wet. Steve, get mine wet. ‘Get it wet. Get the clit wet. ‘Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.’ ‘Vaginer.’ We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Rica. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didn’t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, what happened?’ To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who we’re buddies with, is like, ‘Oh, yeah, the fight?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, what happened?’ I’m ready for the story. And he ‘s like,’ Okay, you see this guy on the ground? ‘You see him on the ground, ‘this guy who they kick in the face? ‘You see him? ‘You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?’ And he goes, ‘Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he ‘s from Panama.’ What? ‘He’ s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.’ That’s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. ‘He’s from Panama.’ That’s it. I was like, ‘But how did the fight… Like, how did you… How did the fight happen?’ He goes, ‘Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. ‘Okay, so this guy on the ground, ‘he cut off this guy in traffic, ‘and he says to him, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Hey, man, fuck you.’ ‘So this guy, he gets out of his car, ‘and he says, ‘Mm-mm, fuck you.’ ‘So then they yell at each other. ‘So this guy say fuck you. ‘This guy, fuck you. This guy, fuck… So both of these guys are fucking you right now.’ I was like, ‘No one’ s fucking me. What are you talking about?’ ‘And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, ‘and his friend, he says, ‘Hey, what happened?’ ‘He says, ‘He said, fuck you.’ ‘He says,’ Ah, fuck you.’ ‘He says, ‘Fuck you.’ He says. ‘Fuck you.’ He fuck… these guys over here are fucking you.’ ‘And the one guy, he says to him… ‘Before he fight with him, he says, ”Hey, motherfucker, where are you from?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Panama.’ ‘And, uh… That ‘s it for him.’ Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? It’s, like… We went zip-lining. It’s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-people… White-water rafting is white-people shit. It’s called white-water rafting. It’s ours. That’s some white-people shit. You’ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. That’s just not what they do. It’s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing? No way. White-water rafting? No. None of the above. Do you even like coffee? I do like coffee. Oh, come on, man. What did he say? I like it black. You like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what I’m talking about. He knows. I went to college with… One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He ‘s like,’ You’re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.’ I was like, ‘I’m taking out the trash.’ He’s like… ‘That’s the type of shit I’m talking about, motherfucker. ‘Just throw that shit outside, bitch. ‘White-people shit! ‘What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.’ What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charmin’… I did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, that’s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We don’t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? I’ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I don’t give a shit. I’ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. We’re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. They’re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. There’s a cute little Italian couple that’s like, ‘Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.’ And you ‘re like,’ Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.’ Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All I’m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. You’re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. There’s nothing wrong with that, you know. Here’s why. Every time I’ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, there’s always one guy in the crew, one dude who’s like, ‘Hey, I got us. I can take us around. ‘I speak a little bit of Mexican. ‘We’ re gonna be good. We ‘ll be good.’ You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Don’t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. We’re gonna be straight. And you’re like, ‘All right, man. I can’t wait.’ You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, ‘Hello, American, americano, ‘American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.’ ‘Cause I don’t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You can’t fuck me. You can’t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, ‘Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.’ He thinks he’s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, ‘Okay, okay, okay, okay. ¿Habla español, señor? ¿Habla español? ¿Habla español?’ Sí, sí, sen-yours. Sí, sí, sen-yours.',\n",
       "  ' Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they ‘re all like,’ Okay. ‘Hmm. Good, good, good. That’s good, good. That’s good.’ And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fucking head until you see him go, ‘Oh, fuck. ‘There’s no bibliotecain there. Where’s the ban-yo? I don’t know any of those words.’ Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, I’m enjoying my plate of rice and ‘polo,’ having a great time… enjoying my life. I came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, ‘What do you want to do about the last name?’ I was like, ‘I don’ t know. I mean, I don’t really care. I don’t think I really care.’ I was like, ‘I mean, what do you want to do?’ She’s like, ‘Well, do you want me to take your last name?’ And there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘No, man, it’s cool.’ Then there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘Yeah, you got to take the last name.’ It’s some male-ego bullshit, but that’s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesn’t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I don’t really know. We don’t really know, you know. Last names… you used to give to somebody ’cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, ‘This will all be yours one day.’ That doesn’t mean shit nowadays. I can’t be like, ‘Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.’ Who gives a shit, right? There’s not much to it. You know, it really doesn’t mean much. But it’s strange when I think about, like, white people’s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guy… Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But it’s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynch… ‘Cause you’re like, ‘Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.’ Switch it up, dog. But last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, ‘What do you want to do?’ I said, ‘How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?’ Right, whosever’s is cooler. She was like, ‘Cooler?’ I was like, ‘Yeah,’ ’cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, ‘Jordan, buckets.’ I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasn’t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllables… San, unh, ti, got you, oh. That’s what’s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, ‘Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And she’s like, ‘What’s wrong with that?’ I was like, ‘What’ s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?’ She’s like, ‘It’s not that big of a deal.’ I said, ‘Well, it’s like part of the Third Reich.’ I’ll have to walk into restaurants, like… ‘We’ re here for the Eichelberger party, ‘the party of two. ‘There is two of us at the party. ‘We would like the table in the back of the room. ‘In the back of the room, ‘behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.’ Anyway, she’s a Santino now. Yeah. We got into a thing, ’cause I was… I feel like I’m watching too much porn lately, if I’m just being real with you guys. We’re getting real. It’s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. It’s a bad thing. It’s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think it’s not my fault, though. I think it’s access… access, too much access. In your pockets, there’s a phone, right? In there is all the porno… All of it… all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would ‘zorb’ myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just go… ‘In the future, all the porno’s in your pocket,’. And get out… and blow my mind. Just… semen everywhere. Oh, my God. I’m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. That’s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It really is too much access. Like, I can’t walk past a laptop without being like… ‘Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.’ The Blue Shirts, they don’t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. We’ve seen so much of it. The problem is… With porn is, it’s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think you’re like them. You’re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They just… It takes off. It’s got loft. Are you kidding me? I’m lucky if mine comes out. It’s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it ‘s like,’ No, no. Go back, go back.’ And when it does come out, it’s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. It’s like, ‘Sorry. We’re here.’ My wife… one night she was like, ‘Oh, come on my tits.’ I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll never make it up there.’ It’s so far. It’s too far. Maybe your belly button, max… if I really put in the work. I’ll tell you what I’ve been watching a lot of. I’ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watch… For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoes… on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. It’s a bad thing. It really is. It’s a bad thing. We need to clean up our min',\n",
       "  'ds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. It’s difficult, man. It’s difficult to do. People always… like, listen, I try to work out. I’m trying to be in shape. I’m trying to do all that stuff. It’s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. You’ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food joint’s open, right? You’re like, ‘You up, McDonald’s? You up?’ You send a late-night text, like, ‘What’ s up, girl? ‘You up? What’s up, McDonald’s? ‘You up? What’s up, Mac D’s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.’ She’s like, ‘Uh-huh.’ McDonald’s is like, ‘You know it.’ You cruise over there, and on the way, you’re like, ‘Ooh, it’ s gonna be good. ‘I know what I get at this location. ‘This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.’ That’s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDiesel’s. Just like that, you’re like… Devour it. And when you’re done, you get in the car and cruise home… Same feeling. Cruising home, and you’re like… ‘I’m a bad person, man.’ Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. I’m trying to stay healthy. I’m trying to fit into my own skin. That’s really what it is. You know, I’m trying to feel good about myself. It’s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ And I said… ‘That’ s my line. ‘I say that. That’s me. ‘I’m doing… That’s what I do. You say, ‘I’m sorry,’ I feel like.’ He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? What’s up? On your face? I feel like that’s some, like, ‘I don’t give a… ‘Whatever, bro. Go ahead. It’s done. ‘I don’ t give a shit. ‘I’ ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I ‘ll cash out.’ On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had no… I was backed up. I was like, ‘Whatever, man.’ And in that moment, I was like, ‘I can’ t win this argument with this dude. I can ‘t beat him physically.’ But I was like, ‘If I had a superpower right now, ‘you know, it wouldn’ t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.’ Right? He’s all, ‘Fuck you.’ I’m like, ‘Fuck me? Fuck you, man.’ No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If you’re not laughing at that, you didn’t have acne when you were a kid. I had really bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. I’m like, ‘What up, dude? What’s the deal? ‘Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.’ Here you are, 13, 14 years old. You’re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and you’re like, ‘Ooh, tough-looking kid.’ You’re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14. Teenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. They’re hard to see, bro. They’re skinny. Their voices are crackling. They’re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny like… Nasty-looking crea… They look like Tim Burton cartoons. They’re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And you’re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, ‘You know what? ‘I’ m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.’ I didn’t get it. I didn’t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. ‘I can die from this medication.’ What’s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this medi… I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. I’ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this is… it’s… it’s better than your face. It doesn’t really matter. You’re an ugly kid. You’re ugly. It’s… it’s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, ‘See you later, basketball.’ Ah, true story. But I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and I’ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. I’m gett',\n",
       "  'ing a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.’ I go, ‘What’s up?’ You’re pretty good, man. Oh, thanks, man. He goes, ‘For a white boy.’ And I was still like, ‘Thank you. I appreciate that.’ I’ll take it. Then he goes, ‘All right, man.’ I go, ‘All right, man.’ He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stops… real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy.’ I say, ‘What’s up, man? What up?’ He goes, ‘What the fuck is all over your face?’ That still hurts today. I’m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, ‘Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.’ No, I didn’t say that. That’s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man. But I always loved black people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think they’re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people don’t like redheads for some reason. There’s this thing. White people see redheads, and they’re like, ‘What do we do with it?’ They don’t like us. They don’t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us names… ‘You fire crotch, you ginger.’ They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guy’s never said that to me. White guys… ‘The carpet match the drapes, bud?’ And I’m always like, ‘Are you a grown-up asking ‘about my penis hair? ‘Is that the level that you’re on? ‘You’ re worried about my penis hair, dude. ‘If you must know, it’s hardwood floors. There ‘s no carpet there, bro.’ I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. It’s like… It’s working overtime under there. That’s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, like… I can’t, I can’t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. That’s a reality check. Now people are like, ‘Huh? What are you talking about?’ White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. We’re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. I’m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people don’t adopt that dog, but black people are like, ‘No, no, no. ‘He good, he good, he good. ‘He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. ‘He gonna be fine. Tripod. ‘Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.’ That’s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the ’90s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ Do you remember that word? Don’t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I don’t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You should’ve stuck around for a while. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ People used to say ‘wigger’ to me ’cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And I’ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team says… ‘Whatever, bro. That dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were like… That’s how they sound, like a train. They were like… When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, just… Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out ’cause that was an attack, you know. They didn’t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, ’cause they were like, ‘That white dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And I heard it, and I was like, ‘Oh… so close.’ How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if you’re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. That’s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell you… Every time I talk to my black guy friends, I’m always like, ‘Hey, man, don’t date white girls.’ Don’t date white girls. Not ’cause I’m racist. I’m clearly not racist. I have black friends. I’m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls ’cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. That’s it. We don’t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquanda… That’s how we’re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while he’s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drake’s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. What’s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. We’re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. You’re it. Tag, you’re it. You’re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called ‘Hit ‘Em Up’… Before he started the lyrics, he goes, ‘So I fucke',\n",
       "  'd your bitch, you fat motherfucker.’ That’s what he said. You’re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, let’s go. Here we go. That’s crazy. That’s how much he hated that guy. That’s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. It’s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I blame one person for the death of hip-hop. His name is Macklemore. That dude is the worst. That dude is the worst. Macklemore is at fault for all this shit going south. Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but he’s not hip-hop, okay? That’s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? You’re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? That’s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesn’t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesn’t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Don’t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I don’t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be like… And I’m like, ‘You got it, you got it.’ That’s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be like… That’s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. What’s wrong with you, bro? This guy’s bullshit. We can’t call him hip-hop. It’s crazy that he’s hip-hop, ’cause it’s not. It’s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me the most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called ‘Same Love.’ It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song I’m not against. I’m for same-sex marriage. I don’t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You don’t fuck kids or animals, I don’t care. That’s it for me. No kids, no animals, we’re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just don’t return that. I don’t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song I’m okay with. It’s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, ‘When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.’ Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. That’s what he said. I thought I was one of you fellas. Thank God I’m not. I’m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that ’cause they applauded him. They were like, ‘Oh, how bold. ‘How brave of Macklemore. ‘He thought he was a homosexual. ‘In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. ‘He’ s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.’ And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to say… ‘I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.’ I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, ‘Hey, fellas.’ I would fag out all day. Like… I was homosexual, bro. It wasn’t a question. It was a fact. That kid’s gay as shit. Little redhead gay kid skating backwards. I was gay, man. I was gay when I was in third grade. You were all gay in third grade. I would beg my mom to let me sleep at other boys’ houses every night of the week. I want to sleep at Billy’s. What are you doing over there? None of your business, Mom! Make the call, please! I was so gay in third grade. If another boy accused me of liking girls, I’d fucking murder that kid. Chicago, Illinois, I got to go. I’m Andrew Santino. Thank you so much, man. Thank you, guys. I love you, Chicago. Everybody who’s anybody has lived in this building, man. Locals, baby… Jordan, Pippen, Longley, Kerr, Paxton. You know it, dude. Ryne Sandberg used to own and live in one of those big white poles at the top. He would have to slide down for breakfast. Al Capone still lives in the basement. Not dead. It’s now called Willis, used to be called Macy’s Tower, after the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, because most of the floats are made right here in this building. It’s actually anatomically to scale… even his balls. The penis is not. They ran out of clay, but the balls are full. And if you look right beyond me, that’s the Adams Street Bridge, named, of course, after the Addams Family. Duh-na-na-na. Oh, you want a fat dick in a bun or a little dick in a bun? I don’t want any penises on the hot dog, just a regular hot dog. Okay, we’re gonna give you a Trump dog, then. Gonna give me a Trump dog? Damn right. You know what? Let me tell you something. You’re not nice, and you’re not nice to people and… We don’t give a fuck about your fucking soft ass. Yes. I’m sick of this abuse. All I want is… Save that pussy-ass shit for somebody else that want to fucking hear it. Good night, pussy lips. Right. Fine, good night. Bye, dick cheese. Get the fuck out of here. I’m leaving. Pussy nose. Well, leave. Tweet, tweety bird. Hey, Andrew, I think the crew’s gonna head out of here. Cool, man. Get out. We’re wrapped. Yeah, I’m here. Do you need a ride, or are you good? I get in my… I can walk. Okay. Cool. Good luck with your special or tour guide, whatever this is. Thanks, dude. Thank you, Bernard. Your email address will not be published.

       " ['Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits… Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offen',\n",
       "  \"ders live around you? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot. Yeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck \",\n",
       "  'you.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have ',\n",
       "  'a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.” I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get t',\n",
       "  'ickets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend. I’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny. I think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t f',\n",
       "  'eel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.” My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, i',\n",
       "  't’s Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.” Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule.',\n",
       "  ' And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on T',\n",
       "  'witter the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?” No. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get ',\n",
       "  \"out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.” This might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better. This man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime Except for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.  Great material. So a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician’s son falling to his death isn’t?  Where are your priorities? They’re just jokes.

       " ['Beth Stelling’s stand-up comedy special, “If You Didn’t Want Me Then,” was recorded at the Victoria Theatre in Dayton, Ohio, which is her hometown. The show was released on Netflix on October 3, 2023. “If You Didn’t Want Me Then” is a hilarious exploration of relationships, self-discovery, and the absurdities of life. Beth brings her signature style to the stage, delivering a performance that is both deeply personal and universally relatable. * * * [loud bang] [rock music playing] [crowd cheering] [mouthing] Thank you, guys. What’s up, Dayton? Thank you. [rock music ends] [sucks teeth] I’m gonna set up my little office here. I’m gonna need these glasses later. My… My vision is declining rapidly. [crowd laughs] Anybody else feel like they’ve been aging in dog years? [crowd laughs] Everything to me looks like, you know, those public park restroom mirrors that are just a buffed sheet of metal? [crowd laughs] [exhales sharply] I’m getting ready like, “I’m seeing a general outline here.” [groans] “That’ll do.” [crowd laughs] I have a whole new appreciation for my teachers in their sixties growing up, who always had, like, mascara right here… [laughs] …and a buzz cut situation. [laughs] I mean, I get it. Work smarter, not harder. [crowd laughs] And now is also the perfect time to announce I plan to age. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Thank you. [crowd cheering, applauding] Naturally, ideally from the comfort of my own home. Somebody’s got to do it. We need a control group in Los Angeles. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] Otherwise, we won’t know what old ladies look like. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] So I volunteer. [crowd laughs] If I do get surgery, it’s going to be a lobotomy. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] [inhales] My friend Monica wants one too, and I just told her, “Fuck it, let’s get our heads done!” [crowd laughs] Let’s get our heads done. [crowd laughs] I ran that joke by my mom first, and… [laughs] …her response was, “Wouldn’t that be nice?” [crowd laughs, applauds] [chuckling] Curveball Diane. [scoffs] [inhales deeply] The pandemic was rough on us all. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I used to be able to shock her. [laughs] Not anymore. I’m very grateful for my mom. She raised me and my two older sisters, who I’m very close with. I met them through my mom in the late ’80s, and… we’ve remained close. My mom’s cool. She absolutely loves the Olympics. She’s obsessed. Huge o-head. Her words. [crowd laughs] She’s also pretty big fan of me. You know, she won’t stop texting. And… [crowd laughs] She likes to hype me up, you know, before shows. And one time, before a show, she said to me, “Bethy, you are so good at stand-up comedy.” “If it were an Olympic event… [crowd laughs] …you would win gold in the women’s stand-up comedy.” [crowd laughs, applauds] [cheering] She did raise us right here in Dayton, Ohio. [crowd cheering] [Beth] Mmm. I knew you guys would be happy for me. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] Not everybody shows us the respect we deserve. You know, we’re the birthplace of aviation. [crowd cheering] Yeah. North Carolina has been coming for us for years. [crowd laughs] Their license plates say, “first in flight.” [scoffs] It’s like, “Okay.” [crowd laughs] It was built in Dayton. We just used you for your wind. [crowd laughs, applauds] [crowd cheering] [Beth chuckling] The flights were short. They meant nothing to them! Shitty hawk. [crowd laughs, applauds] [Beth chuckling] My passions have changed since you saw me last. [scoffs] I’m very into aviation now. [crowd laughs] Nah. We all spent the last couple of years differently. Me personally, I searched the Wright brothers on the internet a couple times. [chuckles] Just to learn about my heritage, the city I come from. [sucks teeth] It’s funny how our whole motto is based upon two men who literally wanted to fly away. [laughs] And they couldn’t.

[crowd laughs] I thought they did popcorn for a bit, but that is Redenbacher. [crowd laughs loudly] Now, you can still go visit it, the original bike shop… The first one has been torn down, as I’m sure everybody here knows. Uh… [chuckles] I believe there’s a credit union or something, but you can still visit the fourth one over… over on Williams. You can poke your head in there, yeah, see all the photos of… of Wilbur and Orville working on the bikes. And there’s another dude in there helping them. There’s no ladies working at the bike shop.

[chuckles] [crowd cheering] I’m scratchy. This is Sleepytime tea. [laughs] [crowd laughs] [chuckles] I’m just, like… [snores] My, um… [smacks lips] …my mom is a pianist, which was funny for a while. [crowd laughs] She taught elementary school music, uh, for 34 years, and I would… I grew up going to visit her classroom even into college. And one time I was visiting her class. She had a second grade group in there. And she was teaching them that song, one, two, buckle, my shoe, three four shut the… You know, classic. [crowd laughs] She has all the kids in a circle. Circles are huge in the music industry. [crowd laughs] And she’s having them finish, you know, like one, two, three, four, five, six. She gets to nine, ten, and she points to this little second grade boy. She says, “Nine, ten,” and he goes, “Big fat asshole.” [laughs] [crowd laughs] I literally had to steady myself on the door frame. I was laughing so hard. My mom was like, “Jonathan, you go sit by the door!” [chuckles] I was like, “Not over here. He’s killing.” [Beth laughs] Nine, ten, big fat asshole? [laughing] It doesn’t even rhyme. [grunting] This kid’s a genius. What, was he just saving it up all day for Diane’s class? Knowing that the worst that would happen to him was like, “Jonathan, you go sit by the door.” “You’re too young to be alone in the hallway, but you’re out of the circle!” [crowd laughs] [laughing] I don’t even know how old second grade is. Nobody tell me. [crowd chuckles] I was like, “Where did he get that?” “Was it a dare?” I personally like to think he probably heard it at home, or some version of it. [laughs] But I have a wild imagination, so. I like to think it was probably his mom… [chuckles] [crowd laughing] …saying it to his dad. [chuckles] “You’ve been gone from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., you big fat asshole!” [crowd laughing] “I could use a little help.” “Especially from five to six, when you’re probably out sucking dicks!” [crowd laughing] “Try to come home again at 3 or 4.” “I’m going to shut the door in your big fat asshole face!” [crowd laughs, applauds] “Oh, Jonathan, I’m sorry you had to see that.” [crowd laughs] [sighs] That is his real name. I… [crowd laughs] I’ve left it his real name in case he needs to find me, uh… [crowd laughs] [Beth chuckles] I wanna know the truth. He should be making his way to the stand-up scene any day now, and… I’ll ask him myself. [crowd chuckles] She also did the high school chorus, and that was after school. So I’d go over there, so I wouldn’t have to have a babysitter. And she would have the chorus up on the risers. And I would be in the aisles doing cartwheels and back walkovers, some splits and stuff, trying to get the high school boys’ attention. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I had crushes on all of them. They were up here, singing their hearts out. It was hot. [crowd laughs] And I don’t know, I was probably in, like, third or fourth grade. You’re a gymnast when you’re young because you’re unaware of the many ways that your neck can break. [crowd laughs] And there’s a lot of benefits to being a gymnast. You know, you’re strong, you’re flexible, the leotards and stuff. [inhales] My mom used to describe my legs as tree trunks, which I tried to explain was damaging, but… now I love it, you know? You could parkour off these babies. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I’m probably going to end up doing a… [sucks teeth] …open-leg casket. [crowd laughs] So… chorus is up here. I’m in the aisles. I have a huge crush on this baritone named Tim. And my mom makes the mistake of letting Tim babysit for me. Very dangerous. [crowd laughs] For him. My love language is sexual harassment. [chuckles] [crowd laughs loudly] Most of the time he spent babysitting, he was stiff-arming the top of my head. Like… [chuckles] While I was like… [roaring] [chuckling] Like this, trying to touch his junk. [crowd laughs] We were an all-female household. I had curiosities. [sucks teeth] But Tim… Tim was very good to me, uh… He took me to the gas station to get candy. Um, he got me a stuffed elephant one year for my birthday. Point is, good guy. [man laughs] And then more… It',\n",
       "  ' could have been his laugh. [crowd laughs] Recently, I actually ran into Tim at the grocery store, at Dorothy Lane Market. [crowd cheering] [laughs] Some fans of the Killer Brownie. [crowd laughs] So, Tim and I were catching up, and he’s like, “Bee, oh my gosh, it’s been ages.” And we were talking and chatting. And he was like, “Oh my gosh, I’m so happy for everything that you’re up to.” And then Tim asked me out on a date. [crowd cheers] Thank you. [crowd laughs] And I just looked at him and I said… [chuckling] “If you didn’t want me then…” [crowd laughing] [chuckling] Bit of a pedophile joke. I think it was fun. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] You have to be careful with pedophilia because you can catch it just by touching a kid. [chuckles] It’s… [crowd laughs] [chuckling] [crowd applauds] [inhales deeply] Mmm. So, we had guinea pigs growing up, and we kept them in our garage. And in the hot Ohio summers, they absolutely died in there. [crowd laughs] And my sister reminded me… [chuckles] …we named one of the pigs Brownie, which, in retrospect, is extra sad. She was out there straight baking at 375. [crowd laughs] [sucks teeth] And my mom felt awful, okay? So she let us give him a proper burial in the backyard. And me and my sisters took those hard-bodied pigs… Not like ripped, but rigor mortis hard. And… we buried them in the easiest place to dig. We put them right in the sandbox. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Then a couple of neighborhood dogs came along… [snores] …snarfed them right up. [chuckling] It was a tragedy all around, and I really feel like it could have been avoided if we just had a dad. [chuckles] [crowd laughing] I don’t know what dads do. But I assume it’s regulate the garage temp. [crowd laughs] They’re always in there tinkering around, planning their escape. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] No, my dad didn’t escape as much as he was asked to leave. [chuckles] Escorted off the premises. [crowd laughs] Some of you know this about my… my dad. When I was little, he moved down to Orlando, Florida, to become an actor, which is not where you go. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] He did land a few gigs. Uh, he… he was an extra in the television series of Swamp Thing. Uh, he was a truck driver in that. And… that’s it. Um… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Then he took things into his own hands, started his own business, and now he’s in the sign spinning biz. He calls it live roadside commercials, or… or character directionals. He likes to devise a character and then present it to the cars. Um… [crowd laughs] He’s a leprechaun in front of this Irish pub called the Kerryman, for example, and the rest of his characters are available on his website. [crowd laughs] [sucks teeth] So, we grew up around a lot of costumes, like thrifting and going to Ray’s Circus of Value and stuff. For example, he loves a morphsuit. You know what those are? [man] No. [woman] Yeah. It’s like what Olympic speed skaters wear, but there’s no hole cut for your face. [crowd laughs] So you’re just in a single Lycra suit, just one color head to toe, no skin’s showing. He wears an orange one in front of the Orange Julius. [crowd laughs] I don’t know how the silhouette of my dad’s penis sells smoothies, but… [chuckles] That was a bit of a tongue twister. I really got through it. “Silhouette of my dad’s penis sells smoothies.” [crowd laughs] He heard me say that, and he was like, “I wear shorts over it. I’m family-friendly.” [chuckles] All right. [Beth chuckling] It doesn’t rain that often in Orlando, and he called me one time after a shift. He said, “There was a sudden downpour, and I almost waterboarded myself.” “I was like…” [panting] “…I couldn’t breathe.” “It was stuck to my face. My fingers were covered.” “The zipper’s on the back of my head. I nearly died.” [crowd laughs] “I had to get into the car. I was so embarrassed.” [chuckles] I was like, “It’s only embarrassing when it’s wet?” [crowd laughs] [Beth chuckles] Anyway, he made it out. So, my sisters and I would have to leave our mom here in Dayton and go visit our dad as kids in Orlando because it was court-ordered. And… [chuckles] …we didn’t have a ton to do down there, uh, because we didn’t go to school, so we, like, couldn’t make friends, and all the neighbors were… old or from Florida. Uh… [laughs] [crowd laughs] So we did a lot of playing in the costumes. And there were a ton of them. The garage was wall-to-wall filled with costumes. Sometimes, we would find strangers in there. [crowd laughs] Because they thought it was a garage sale. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] So,',\n",
       "  ' one night, it was just me and my oldest sister, Meghan, we’re playing in the costumes, doing a photo shoot. [inhales] I put on, um, this, like, muscle tee. You know what I mean? A muscle tee, but then there’s huge latex muscles that you put your arms through. And then a brown curly wig, and, um, it just wasn’t working for me. I was like, “What’s my motivation?” You know? So… Then Meghan put on this, like, gray pinstripe suit, a Dick Tracy hat, and some wingtip shoes. And she… It was really working for her. Uh, she was feeling herself. And so I decided to go with something fresh, unopened. I went and put on this full red lace bodysuit. And then we whipped up the tunes, we were dancing around. Meghan is, like, six years older than me. We’re dancing. I do a high kick, and Meghan goes, “Oh my God, Beth!” [inhales] “There’s a hole in the crotch of that.” [crowd laughs] [exhales sharply] I was like, “Cool!” [crowd laughs] “So you can pee?” [chuckling] She was like, “Um, yeah, take it off right now.” [crowd laughing] [chuckles] I was just a sixth grader in a sex suit. Then… [chuckles] This is when my dad comes in. I believe we were told to be quiet. And… He’s… He pokes his head in. He’s like, “Girls, get out here. You’re gonna want to see this.” And we were like, “Do we want to see what’s in your backyard at midnight in Orlando, Florida?” What we didn’t expect to see were just 18 raccoons eating out of a huge trough of dog food that he provided them. [crowd laughs] He goes, “I threw in some Hershey Kisses.” [chuckles] “Even raccoons deserve dessert.” [chuckles] I was like, “That I agree with, honestly.” “Everybody deserves dessert. Otherwise, this is disgusting.” He said, “Don’t worry, Bee.” “Every night, after they’re done eating, I bleach the deck.” [chuckling] “What?” “You’re telling me you’ve created for yourself a 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. unpaid raccoon internship?” [crowd laughs] “Take back your life, man.” As you can imagine, over the years, the numbers skyrocketed exponentially. He was helping rodents flourish in the back. He told me recently they’re actually mammals from the weasel family. [chuckles] Well, I thought the highest the number got was 73. But he FaceTimed me a couple of weeks ago. I didn’t pick up, and… [chuckles] …if I don’t pick up, he’ll text right away. He’s like, “Beth, this is your dad.” [chuckles] So our whole text thread is just like, “Beth, this is your dad.” “Beth, this is your dad.” “Beth, this is your dad.” [laughs] Which seems weird, but, like, he’s right. I never save his number. So, it’s good. [crowd laughs] [smacks lips] But he told me that the highest it actually got was 91. Ninety-one raccoons. But back when it was still in the forties, um… my sister decided to calculate how much he was spending on dog food per year, because she was hoping to go to college, and… [crowd laughs] [smacks lips] …apparently he was spending $4,000 a year on dog food. Didn’t calculate the Hershey Kisses. Apparently those are marginal. [crowd chuckles] He goes, “I know it’s a problem.” “But on the off nights I don’t feed ’em, they take their long skinny fingers, they pick up rocks from the rock garden, and they roll them up and down against my bedroom window until I come out and feed ’em.” [silent scream] [chuckling] “What?” [chuckles] “Call an exterminator immediately!” But I just didn’t think about what the phone call would be like for him. Just like, “Yeah, we got a little bit of a raccoon problem on our hands.” “How many?” [sucks teeth] “Exactly 91.” [crowd laughing] “Do you need their names or… No? Okay.” “How did it happen?” “Whoo! My goodness.” “I got to tell you, uh, direct result of my actions.” [crowd laughs] So, it’s like far too expensive to exterminate. So… And plus, it would be a literal genocide. I… [laughs] Ninety-one raccoon carcasses. It’s like up to here. So… he decides to go with trapping and releasing into the wild. He bought two traps, but they were expensive. So he made one of his own, which I imagine was just a piece of fruit in his mouth, and his open arms. Like… [crowd laughing, applauding] [laughing] He was taking them one by one. [chuckles] He was releasing them into the wild. He was very proud because it took so long, so he liked to update me. He’s like, “So far, I’ve got 39 raccoons, two possums, and a black cat.” [crowd laughing] “There’s still a bunch of them out there. Biguns.” He was taking them in his car. He drives a Geo, which is essentially a roller skate. [crowd laughing] And… he was putting a blanket over the cage. I was like, “So',\n",
       "  \" they can’t find their way back or…” He’s like, “I didn’t want them to get rattled.” He’s like, “But still, they poke their fingers through the blanket, and they sound like Halloween.” [crowd laughing] [scoffs] I don’t know if I’ve painted a good picture of my father thus far, but… [crowd laughs loudly] …this is the same man who visited me in Chicago once, when I was living there, and he described riding the L train “like Jurassic Park.” [chuckles] So I have no clue what he’s talking about when he says “they sound like Halloween.” Whether it’s like… [mimics suspenseful music] Like one of those ghosts you walk by at CVS. It’s like… [mimics a ghost moaning] [laughs, sighs] He’s like, “Did I tell you one of them got out in the car?” [crowd laughing] I was like, “No, but it sounds like you do want to tell me.” He’s like, “Thankfully, I was just outside the driveway, so I open the back hatch, it hissed at me, and I drove off.” [chuckles] I was like, “Been there.” [crowd laughs] He was taking… When he said “releasing them into the wild,” I thought he was taking them to his neighbors’ trash cans. Like, “One for you. One for you. One for you.” But on that FaceTime… I did call him back, and he told me, “Listen. News developed.” He said, uh, “Under the cover of night, I’ve been taking them over to the Kerryman because there’s a fresh water source.” Now, if you recall, the Kerryman is where my dad is a leprechaun in front of. So… [chuckles] …he just increased his job description to, like, “Get in here for the lunch deals, and don’t look at all these raccoons I dropped off.” [crowd laughs] So he goes, “I finally got down to the lead raccoon.” “And I walked him over there. I put his cage down in the grass, and I just was standing there in my swim trunks.” [chuckling] I was like, “Were you baptizing them before they left?” [crowd laughs] He’s like, “And Snorkie walked right out of his cage.” “They don’t always do.” “And he walked over to me, and with his bare hand…” [laughing] I’m like, “What else would it be?” [crowd laughs] Were you putting them in little outfits? “I’m gonna need the gloves back, my guy.” “And the top hat as well. Yeah.” “Thank you so much. Keep the cane. You’re gonna need it.” He goes, “Snorkie walked over to me, and with his bare hand, he went like this on my crock.” [crowd laughing] “As if to say, ‘Thank you.'” [chuckles] I was like, “Yeah, or as if to be like, ‘Here’s rabies, bitch.'” [crowd laughs] “Thanks for ruining me and my closest 90 relatives’ lives.” “You know what doesn’t grow out here? Dog food and Hershey Kisses.” “We’re f’ed!” “Take me back.” [laughs] [crowd laughs] Only difference between me and the raccoons is I’ve never been on a Christmas card. Uh… [laughs] [crowd laughs] I’m fine with it. I’m at peace. [chuckles] I always liked spending Christmas here better. It always feels weird to have a warm Christmas. I also feel like, because I grew up here in Dayton, I got most of my alcohol drinking out of the way in eighth grade. [crowd laughs] And then, by the time high school rolled around, I was pretty grizzled, you know? [chuckles] “I gotta get my shit together.” [crowd laughing, applauding] Who else is going to lead this field hockey team to State for the first time in 15 years? [crowd cheering] For those of you, uh, that don’t know, field hockey is a sport, and… [crowd laughing] …you play it with a stick and… and a ball. People used to call us “Chicks with Sticks…” [chuckles] …and then inevitably “Chicks with Dicks.” It’s like, “Who would want to get penetrated by a long wooden stick when I have a perfectly good mouth and finger?” No, I’m just kidding. I… [laughs] No, I’ve actually… I’ve never… or I should say, I haven’t yet gone down on a woman. Um… I have had a man go down on me so badly, I’ve thought, like, “Let me down there.” [chuckles] [inhales] “Just to see.” [chuckles, inhales] “It can’t be that hard.” [chuckles] Especially if you love her. Okay. Back to my eighth grade drinking problem. [crowd laughs, applauds] [laughs, sighs] We would, uh… We would sleep over at Mary’s house, and we would sneak out around midnight, cross Irving into the University of Dayton.[crowd cheers] Well, you might want to wait. Uh… [crowd laughs] [laughs] We would wander into a frat house, get hammered, and then some of my girlfriends would hook up with the frat dudes. See? [laughs] A little rugged to think about college dudes hooking up with eighth grade girls. [chuckles] I feel like the only time men believe women is when we’re lying about being 18. [laughs] [cr\",\n",
       "  'owd laughs] [Beth sighs loudly] [crowd cheering, applauding] [laughs] Frat dudes are like, “What am I supposed to do? Check her ID?” I’m like, “Check… [hesitates] …check her face.” [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Is it underdeveloped and over-contoured? Does it look like she still believes in Santa? [laughs] Are her teeth still white? Behind the braces. [crowd laughs] Naturally, that night, in eighth grade, me and my girlfriends were arrested… [chuckles] …for being too young and hot. [crowd laughs] Well, that was a body roll for anybody who forgot eighth grade. [laughs] I used to practice the body roll in the mirror before dances. I’d be like… [groaning] “Yes!” Sometimes, I’d really kick an arm out to really get it going. [chuckling] Get out there and make some boys cream their khakis. [crowd laughs] Okay, honestly, I had no clue what I was doing, for the record. I had no clue I was making you guys tuck your boners up in your waist pants. [crowd laughs loudly] Just one lift of the shirt, I could have looked it directly in the eye, like… [shouts] [crowd laughing] Late apology from me. I’m sorry. I’ll type it up in the notes app. Post it later. [sucks teeth] But it was campus police who got us. So there was a cop car ride, but… but no cuffs. And then they took us back to the stesh very late at night and put us in a badly lit conference room, where they made us wait it out. And we were scared. [crowd laughs] And then, finally, a cop came in, and he picked up the phone book, and he slammed it down on the table, and he said, “Call your parents.” [scoffs] I was like, “I know the number.” [crowd laughs] [laughing] [crowd cheering] “Call your parents?” “I only have a mom! Why do you think I’m down here?” [crowd laughs] She did pick me up. Uh… Not very pleased with it, but… She… she said, “Something bad could’ve happened to you.” “They could’ve taken advantage of you. I’m just glad you’re okay.” I was like, “I’ve got no tits.” [crowd laughs] She said, “But you have an excellent personality.” [crowd laughs, applauds] “Now get in the van!” [laughs] What if my mom was like, “Now get in the van!” “We’re driving you right back to Sigma Chi, and we’re going to get you one of those frat dudes!” [laughs] I did drive home though, actually. Um, after the pandemonium dust settled, I drove from California to Ohio. I just wanted, like, to feel in charge instead of flying, you know? And my mom was very worried about me driving alone, cross-country. I mean, I was worried about me. I tinted my windows, I bought a knife. But… there’s other things to worry about besides being the hottest person at a rest stop. [crowd laughing] [laughs] For example, um, yeah, if you are traveling alone, hot tip. If someone suspect starts swiftly walking towards you, you can just say, “I’ve actually already been raped. Thank you so much.” [laughs] “I’m good. Thank you.” And men hate to be second, so they’re, “Thank you for letting me know.” [crowd laughing] And then they’re out of there. I also went camping one of the nights, alone. I went camping in Zion National Park. It was the summer everybody was disappearing. And I was like, “Let’s give it a whirl.” [crowd laughs] I’m not even a huge camper.per. I just… I feel like it’s a good thing to do, to try, you know, at least once, alone, especially if you go into it with the perspective of, like, this is what it’s like to be a woman in the world, especially at night, because you can’t lock a tent flap. If you know what I mean. [chuckles] [crowd chuckles] [sucks teeth] If I would, I could. Uh… So I’m in my tent. Night has fallen. I have barricaded the flap as best I can. [crowd laughs] And I heard, like, the snap of a branch, and I grew scared. And that is when I decided to be two people. And I did the voices of two people within my tent. [crowd cheering] [laughing] And what we discovered there is… [laughing] …when I have every opportunity in the world in front of me, my husband is so mean to me. [laughing] [sighs] I was like, “Goodnight, honey.” And he said, “You go to bed!” [crowd laughs] “But first, you suck my dick!” [crowd laughs] [inhales deeply, scoffs] I was like, “Okay.” “At least I’m not alone right now!” [crowd laughing] I made the campers around me fall asleep to the sounds of me choking. [laughs] Just to keep it realistic. I did open with one bark up top. [mimics zip up] Directly into the tip. Just… I always do it just to show it who’s boss. [crowd laughs] [laughing] Other than that, I’m not much of a risk-taker. Uh… I don’t gamble. I would never bungee jump or… ',\n",
       "  'or get married. I… [chuckles] If I had to choose any of those risks… [sucks teeth] …I’m probably gonna bungee. [crowd laughs] I’m gonna bungee it. I got to figure like a grouping of synthetic fibers has to be stronger than two people making a promise. [laughing] [inhales deeply] Eh… And plus it’s, you know, it’s easier to bounce back from. I… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Of all the messaging I’ve received as a gal in this world, I do feel most at peace with my decision not to wed. Sometimes it’s hard to separate messaging from what you really want. And other times your body will kick in, you know. Like, I might still want kids. I just know I won’t have time to come home and let them out. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] It’s something you got to consider, uh, before you get into the kid biz. Me and my boyfriend, we’re actually trying and trying and trying, but I’m on birth control. And… [chuckles] [crowd laughs] [inhales] …it makes it difficult, uh, to conceive. Over the years, I have experimented recreationally with all different forms of birth control. And the first one I got into was, um, was the IUD. I had that for, like, eight years, and I got so much done. And… I remember when I got the second one inserted, the nurse asked me, she said, “Your uterus is tilted backwards.” “Did you know that?” And I remember thinking, “Don’t know how I could.” [chuckles] “But what you’re telling me is even my uterus is like…” “Mm-mm.” [chuckles] [crowd laughs] “We’re good.” And then, more recently, I had to get an ultrasound, and I found out I actually have a bicornate uterus, which means my uterus is like heart-shaped, which is pretty on brand for me. [crowd laughs] But what it meant was, uh, the IUD… This is, um, my impression of an IUD. [smacks lips] It was in there, bopping him on the head or whatever it’s doing. [groans] [crowd laughs] And… some of them could have, you know, swam around and then gotten in trouble up in these parts. So, point being, that was not the right form of birth control for my body. So in my thirties, I started taking the pill, just ’cause I wanted to know what it would be like to be a different person. [crowd laughs, applauds] And we found out. Uh… They started me on Yaz. Has anybody here tried or tasted Yaz? [crowd laughs] You have. Are you still on it, or…? [woman] No. No. You got Yazzed. [crowd laughs] I would describe it as psychological warfare. Uh… They really don’t want us to be in charge. [chuckles] Like, “If you’re not gonna have kids to keep you at home, this will, you crazy bitch.” [crowd laughs] [laughing] [crowd applauding, cheering] Does anybody want… No pressure. Does anybody want to share why they stopped taking Yaz, or…? I just like to open the floor in case anybody needs to, um, get something off their chest, um, or, you know, if you’re with somebody you took it for and want them to know what you went through. [crowd laughs] Depression? Rock on. [laughs] Add it to the fun list. Anybody? Again, no presh. This is for you. [crowd laughs] I’ve done all my research. I’ll go. Um… [crowd laughs loudly] I feel like being on that birth control… [woman] Multiple personalities! Oh, and she’s a little late, that one. [crowd laughs] [Beth laughing] We’re glad you’re both here. [crowd laughs, applauds] [laughing] [crowd cheering] [sighs] No, but I do feel like being on that birth control is the closest my boyfriend will get to a threesome. Just like, “me and me!” [crowd laughs] [laughing] I still keep three extra months of it in my purse. Uh… [chuckles] Just in case I need to… lift a car. Uh… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Or I meet another person that wants to… [whispers] “…start a fire.” [crowd laughing] I did have… I will say we did have some fun with that birth control, because we’d do some birth control bits, my boyfriend and I, you know, like rough stuff. Uh… ‘Cause I would take it… I would take it before bed. Um, and so I’d be sitting across the bed from him in our matching morphsuits with the hole cut out, and… [crowd laughs] I would say to him, “Thank you for reminding me to take the pill.” He didn’t, but I like to put that on him. [chuckles] And then I would take the pill, and he’d make me lift up my tongue to make sure I swallowed it, like… [crowd laughs] And then we would do tasting notes with the birth control. Because he considers himself a bit of a sommelier, so. He’d say, “What are some of the flavor profiles you’re getting from that? I’m a sommelier.” And I’d say, “Um, I’m getting, like, salty tears.” [crowd laughing] “And jealousy.” And then he’d f',\n",
       "  'eel bad and give me a kiss. And I’d be like, “Um, it’s so powerful. Any residual flavor profile for you?” And he was like… [sucks teeth] “Total peace and freedom.” [laughs] [laughing maniacally] “Night, night!” [crowd laughing] So after that, they did switch me, uh, to other birth control. [chuckling] I switched to Larin Fe which is generic for low estrogen. Not sponsored. I don’t know why I got so specific. [chuckles] I wish. Can you imagine if I was sponsored by Larin Fe? [chuckles] They just reached out on Instagram. They’re like, “Hey, what’s up?” “We saw you made the switch.” [crowd laughs] “Curious if you could do a quick promo bit for us.” I’d say, “Sure.” And they’d say, “Action!” I’d just be like, “Um…” “It’s like a little bit better. I don’t know.” [pretends to sob] [crowd laughs] [moans] “Should I read the side effects? Or…” They’re like, “Please don’t do that!” I’d be like, “That’s weird, ’cause I actually… always have the side effects printed out with me at all times.” [crowd laughs] “The, uh, side effects of Larin Fe are nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating, spotting, changes in menstrual flow, nipple discharge.” [laughs] “Not yet, but here it comes.” [crowd laughs] [chuckling] “Breast tenderness, breast enlargement, changes in weight, rash, depression, sleep problems, weakness, tired feeling, mood changes, yeast infection.” I guess we’re starting to see why nobody wanted to yell anything out. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Somebody’s here on a first date, and they’re like, “Yeast infection!” “Today, tomorrow, and every night, baby!” [laughs] Their date is like, “That’s why you’re shifting around in your chair.” [crowd laughs] I actually do have a, um, a yeast infection joke that I can never really find a home for, but… [laughs] This does feel like a good spot for it. And… I did hear a chant from the back that was like, “Tell it. Tell it. Tell…” [inhales deeply] Thank you. So the yeast infection joke goes like this. I won’t know that you’re cheating on me, but my hoot will, because it turns into, like, an old southern chef that’s like, “I knew you were having guests, so I baked something.” [crowd laughing] [inhales] [crowd applauding] [crowd cheering] [Beth laughs, sighs] [sucks teeth] “Swelling. [crowd laughs] Freckles or dark patches of skin on the face.” The “or” is troubling. Uh… [chuckles] One of those is way worse. [crowd laughs] Can you imagine starting at the same time as your friend? You guys get together for lunch. You’re like, “What’d you get, freckles or dark patches?” [chuckles] “Oh man, I got dark patches.” [laughing] The last one’s migraine. Larin Fe is like… [chuckles] The birth control company is like, “Could you put a spin on that or something?” I’d be like, “All I heard was breast enlargement!” [mimics horn blaring] [laughing] [sighs] I didn’t have boobs for the longest time. Aforementioned, I was a gymnast. Side packs for ages. I was ripped as a child. And when you don’t have boobs as a kid, you really want ’em because we’re taught that they’re our worth, and… I do remember, um, wearing a padded swimsuit at the… at the pool. The trouble with that is when you get out of the pool, there’s, like, just two waterfalls dripping underneath. [laughs] The good thing was I was strong enough that I was able to pull myself out of the pool and, at the same time, squeegee my tits out, and then head to the snack bar, get a frozen Snickers, whatever you want to break a tooth on. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] But by the time junior high came, I couldn’t just show up empty-chested. How was I going to get a dude back to my mom’s unfurnished basement? [chuckling] So I had to act fast. I went up to my mom’s room. I stole her water bra, which Victoria’s Secret stole from a hose and water balloons. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] And then just charged us fifty bucks, and we were like, “Honestly, we’ll do anything.” So I strapped on the water bra, I marched to junior high, and it worked. I snagged a teen. I was also a teen at the time, just to be clear. [crowd laughs] I got him back to my mom’s unfurnished basement, popped in the Billy Elliot VHS, which was my fuck tape. I… [crowd laughs] [laughs] I still don’t know how that movie ends. And the water bra made me inadvertently celibate. ‘Cause I wanted to be touched, but I couldn’t let him touch or put any sort of, like, weight upon it, because it made a strange like… [mimics water creaking] …sound that I could not explain. And I also couldn’t do a sneaky release underneath my shirt and chuck it far away, ’cause it was',\n",
       "  ' like the weight of an X-ray vest. [crowd laughing] It was like, “Fuck.” [chuckles] And after that, I would have had no choice but to be like… [gasps] “Ta-da!” [chuckles] “I made my boobs disappear!” [crowd laughs] “And now, for my assistant, my mom taking the towels out of the dryer.” [crowd laughs] And magic is not hot, you know, it never will be. It’s a trick. A guy wants boobs, and he gets water. Not cool. [crowd chuckles] I feel like the only time that would work is if the… if it was like reversed or something. Like, you were running a marathon, and I was volunteering on the side with the water. And you came up for the water, and I was like, [whispers] “Or you can touch my tits.” [crowd laughs] Like, “Oh my God. Thank you so much. I know there’s water up here.” “I don’t know when there’s gonna be tits again. Thank you.” [laughs] That was the longest I’ve run in a while. Um… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] The last time I went running was through the airport, and it tasted like coins in the back of my mouth. [chuckling] Just a little bullet back there. I didn’t grow my boobs until college, and it was with ice cream. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] And since then I’ve gained and lost weight so many times over the years, my boobs are like an atheist dad at Catholic mass who’s just like, “I’m not going to get up again.” [chuckles] “This is insane!” [crowd laughing] [sucks teeth] Okay. Hu… huge news. [laughs] Okay, it’s not that big news. No, huge news. I got a king-sized bed. Thank you so much. Thank you. [crowd cheering] Things are going well. Yeah. I got a king-sized bed, and I started hooking up with this 6-foot-6 football player dude. And I’m just like… [laughs] …if you build it… [chuckles] [crowd laughs] …they will come. At the time, I was hooking up with a smaller gentleman. And I don’t know if you’ve ever done the back and forth between sizes of people, but it can feel drastic. Uh… It’s sort of like when you go to the fridge for a jug of juice that you think is full, but it’s empty, and you’re like, “Whoa!” [crowd laughs loudly] [laughs] It’s the only way I can describe that. I was pregnant once, but I caught it early. And I went over to Planned Parenthood and got some… some Mife and Miso and… and what I call “jump-started a late period.” And then I went and did a table read and a taping for Comedy Central. So we really can have it all. [crowd laughs] And, you know, if you’re feeling like, um, you don’t align with this story or my beliefs, don’t worry. There is somebody in the story, that, um, shares yours. It’s a leprechaun in Orlando. Um… [crowd laughing] [applauding, cheering] My dad… [chuckles] My dad hates Planned Parenthood. [chuckles] He thinks all I do is kill babies because I got the one abortion there. [sucks teeth] You guys, I’m kidding. [chuckles] I haven’t told him yet, but… [crowd laughs] I always tell him if abortion were murder, there’d be a Law & Order: SVU about it. [chuckles] And that he understands. [crowd laughs] But I do like to donate to them in his name and… [crowd laughs] ‘Cause they do other stuff. There’s all kinds of people in there, um, looking for a good deal on an ultrasound. Um, getting those free condoms that are so thick. Uh… [laughs] Why are the free condoms so thick? It’s almost like they’re trying to drum up business. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I… There’s people in there getting their penises checked and also their balls. I don’t want to alienate anybody here with balls. I… I never do. I love balls. [chuckles] I genuinely love balls. I could actually get emotional thinking about it. I… I love balls. I feel like they’re the closest I’ll come to a deep-sea creature. They’re just… [crowd laughs] …they’re so amorphous and malleable. [laughs] And then sometimes they shell up, you know. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] [Beth sighs] So I did this fundraiser. [crowd laughing] This fundraiser for Planned Parenthood. It’s this yearly event called the Birds and Bees Bash. That happens in Santa Barbara, California, where a bunch of rich old people gather together and throw money at the cause. It’s a beautiful thing. So they invited me to come do 15 minutes of stand-up, and I show up. It’s a swanky event, so I’ve slapped on a skirt, which is obviously a big deal for me. And they sit me down in the back of this beautiful banquet hall, next to Joanna Kerns. If you don’t know who that is, it’s Mrs. Seaver from Growing Pains. And if you don’t know who that is… [chuckles] …I don’t care. I was so excited. [crowd laughs] I sat down, and I was like, “Mom.” [crowd lau',\n",
       "  'ghs] So she explains she’s going to give the keynote speech, and then she’ll bring me up to do stand-up. I was like, “Great.” So Joanna’s up there talking about Planned Parenthood and how they helped her and her family, uh, with breast exams, and a woman at the back of the room, at the table next to us, starts to have a heart attack. And Joanna just keeps talking ’cause she doesn’t know what’s going on in the back of the room. Just like I can’t know what’s going on in every room I’m in. People could be up in the balcony making sweet love, and we’d have no clue, especially if it was, like, super slow, like I like. [crowd laughs] So Joanna’s up here, talking, this woman is having a heart attack. I’m watching her have a heart attack, and I’m also thinking, like, “What jokes am I going to tell?” You know. [crowd chuckles] And then an ambulance comes very quickly, almost as if they knew there was a gathering of olds, and they just parked on the corner. [crowd laughs] So they rush in. They put this woman on the stretcher. Because it was a heart attack. It was a low-key heart attack. She fell out of her chair, and her husband was worried. But as they were wheeling her out on the stretcher, past our table, towards the door, she looked at us, and she said, “I’m so sorry. I’m fine.” “I’m so sorry.” [crowd laughs] Which might be the epitome of being a woman. Like, “I’m sorry I interrupted with a heart attack.” “I’m happy to die if that helps. I really will. I’ll go die.” [crowd chuckles] So just as they have her outside the door, this is when Joanna leans into the mic, and she said, “Who’s ready for some stand-up comedy?” [crowd laughing] And I was like, “Oh no.” So I get up, and I’m like weaving my way through the tables in my dumb skirt. And the woman who’s planned the event is panicked. And she rushes, she intercepts me, she puts her hand on my shoulder, and she’s like, “I don’t know.” “Maybe you should do less time, like 5 minutes or something?” I was like, “Bitch, I’m doing 15.” [crowd laughing loudly] So I got up there, and I felt like I really needed to address the situation, because I hadn’t learned this lesson yet. [crowd laughs] And I got up there in front of everybody, and I just said, “Wow.” “I have done a lot of things to get out of donating money, but never that!” [chuckles] [crowd laughs, applauds] [crowd cheering] [chuckles] There were less laughs. Uh… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] it’s taken me a few years to be able to talk about that. [crowd laughs] But I do feel like my dad would be proud of me. I bombed the Planned Parenthood. [chuckles] [laughs, sighs] Can a mammal from the weasel family do that? [crowd laughs] Feels like I’m making the Christmas card this year. [crowd laughs] [crowd cheering] Thank you very, very much for being here for me. [rock music plays] I love you. [mouthing] Thank you. [crowd cheering, applauding] [rock music continues] [rock music ends] Okay, where’s Tim? [crowd laughs] Tim is here, but he actually… I don’t want to ruin it for you guys. He did babysit for me, but that other part was a joke. [crowd laughing] Aw. Are you guys disappointed he’s a good guy, or…? [laughs] [crowd laughs] Kara and I worked at, um, Graeter’s together. First job. [crowd cheers] I invented the chocolate weasel, so if you ever enjoyed that, you’re welcome. [crowd laughs] [woman] Tim’s up here! Love you, Tim. [crowd laughing] Oh, Tim would be in the balcony… to get a better view. [crowd cheers] I’m kidding. I’m sorry. My mom’s here. There she is. Give it up for Diane here. [crowd cheers] The Schaeffer family. My second family here in town. Schaeffers, Beth and Alan. Amy may or may not have been there that night that we went to UD. [crowd laughs] [Beth] You knew it. You had to come pick us up. Alan’s like, “Can I not be a lawyer for one night?!” [crowd laughs] [Christmas music playing] [Christmas music ends] Your email address will not be published.

       " [\"[audience cheering, whistling] [emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Burr! [cheering and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. How are ya? How’s it goin’? All right. You guys standin’ up, sit down. Sit down. See if I’m funny. I’ve been inside for a year and a half just like you. All right. It’s nice to be out here in Denver, man. [cheering] [chuckles] It’s legal on a state level, but not on a federal level, man. Everybody out here dressing like they’re fuckin’ goin’ hiking. [chuckles] Your North Face pajamas and all this shit you guys have. You guys all live inside. So, how have you guys been doin’, man? How has your pandemic been? You enjoyed it? You been staying inside? Are you being safe? [man] No! I am so fed up with people… “I ain’t bein’ safe! I don’t fuckin’ believe in it!” “It’s all a bunch of lies!” We’re just totally divided. The people that are like, “You gotta get vaccinated.” “You have to wrap yourself in an afghan, and you gotta cover your face and hold your breath when you look at pictures of people.” And you got the other side, “I don’t give a shit!” “I’m gonna have my balls out, walkin’ down the street, ’cause that’s what Jesus said in John 13.” “I read it in my bible study class. I don’t give a fuck.” “And if I get it, I’m goin’ to the hospital and be like, ‘All right, fix me, you were right.'” Everybody, all hypocritical. All the liberals, “You gotta wear the mask, gotta wear the mask.” Then half of them when they talk, they’re pullin’ it down. They got it up under their fuckin’ nose. Then the other assholes, they were all patriotic for years. “America, love it or leave it!” “Support the troops!” “You don’t like it, get the fuck out.” “America, love it or leave it.” All right, take the vaccine. “Well, I don’t trust the government.” Where the fuck did that come from? I thought you were all about it. I thought you were waving the flag and all of that shit. Listen, here’s the deal. We’re never gonna solve this shit until we all get on the same page, which we know is never gonna happen, it’s never gonna happen. So, we gotta set up some Hunger Games shit to solve it. And whoever wins, wins. It’s the non-vaxxers versus the vaxxers. So there’s a giant field, and all the people who don’t want to get the vaccine, all the fatties and the fuckin’ lunatics, right? You gotta fuckin’ run the length of the field and try to make it to the other side while there’s a helicopter flying over you and they’re shooting the vaccine down at you. All right? And I know what you’re thinkin’, “Well, that ain’t fair, man.” “I’m runnin’ in my shit-kickers, you’re up there in a helicopter and you got a gun.” Well, here’s how we… It’s a liberal with a gun, right? They’re not good at that. Say, “Oh, my God, is it alive? Is it gonna hit me?” “I don’t feel safe!” And by then, you’re already halfway there. One of the straps of your overalls is off. If you make it to the other side, in the end, just like dodgeball, we’ll just score it. “Who won?” It’s an idea, I don’t know. I just… I don’t know what else to do. I’ve kind of quit. I’m like… I’ve got to be honest with you. For the first like, you know, year of this shit, I was an American, you know, and I was rootin’ for everybody, and then, I don’t know. They let us outside for a couple of weeks and then they sent us back in, and I just didn’t have it in me anymore. It’s like, “I don’t care. I just don’t give a shit.” “You know, I hope a lot more people die, I really do.” But the one good thing about this whole pandemic shit, and I really hope by the time this fuckin’ thing comes out that this will be considered old, I don’t know, God willing, but the one great thing about this pandemic shit is it kind of slowed down a little bit of that cancel culture. You know what I mean? Yeah. It’s kind of hard to take your dick out at work when you’re at home. You know? Some people still manage to do it. They’re on a Zoom call, no pants on. All of the sudden, standing up, their chunk right in the screen. Still figured out a way to get fired. It was unreal. It’s kind of good, though, that those creeps got to take a break, ’cause I felt like cancel culture, they were kind of running out of people to cancel. You know? As much as they wanted to make it seem, there really was a finite amount of people that took their dick out at work. Despite the stats, right? “Every 1.6 seconds, somebody takes their dick out and shakes it in a woman’s face in a cubicle.” You’re like, “What? Every 1.6 seconds?” I must not have been paying attention. “Every 3.2 seconds, some man jizzes on a fern and rubs it in a woman’s face.” Holy shit! I didn’t know that. Right? Yeah. So fortunately they rounded up all of these fuckin’ animals… and they got rid of them, right? But it kind of became like this cottage industry and it was a way to kind of get rid of some men that maybe were in your way, you know? It’s like anything. You know, the initial thing, you agree with it, and then it kind of gets out of control. So, I don’t know. But it kind of ran out of people and there was this hilarious moment, like last year where they started to try and cancel dead people. Remember that? All of the sudden, out of nowhere, John Wayne was trending. Have they got some found footage, a new movie coming out that maybe they shelved? Then all of the sudden it was all these stupid-ass “woke” white people, right? “Oh, my God, did you see what John Wayne said in Playboy in 1971?” Can you… this is a bunch of fuckin’ white people all up in arms about a dead white guy. “I can no longer tolerate this.” “I can no longer tolerate dead-for-45-years John Wayne saying things in a magazine that doesn’t exist anymore.” “I am here for Black people.” These fuckin’ idiots. What kind of a fuckin’ idiot white person refers to themselves as “woke”? You know? If you actually were socially conscious, you’d realize that white people stole that word from Black people. Once again doin’ the Elvis thing. Right? But you know what, I blame Black people for that. One of them fucked up. They were at a party, there was white people there, and they let it slip out. “Stay woke” or however the fuck you say it. And some white person heard it, like, “Ah, what was that?” “Oh, my God.” “‘Stay woke’? I wanna say that.” “I gotta say that around my white friends so they know that I’m down.” “Oh, my God, I’m gonna fuckin’ say that.” “I’m fuckin’ woke. I’m fuckin’ woke.” “I’m a woke stickler.” “I’ve fuckin’ had it, I’ve had it.” “I support Black people in my white apartment on Twitter.” “That’s what I do. I’m fuckin’ here for you.” Every white person likes to lie to themselves that if they were alive 150 years ago, that they would have been working on the underground railroad, trying to help slaves escape, right? “I would be one of the good\",\n",
       "  ' white people, yes.” “I would have taken time out of my day, risked my life.” And the reality is, is you’d be doing back then exactly what you’re doing today… nothin’. Not a fuckin’ thing. Maybe a little #BlackLivesMatter. “Oh, my God, my heart breaks on my L-shaped couch.” My favorite thing about the Black Lives Matter marches was the store windows that would have the plywood over the windows, and then it would say, “Black lives matter” on top of the plywood. I just loved the duality of that message, you know? It’s like, “Black lives matter, we’re all the same, we’re all one.” “Don’t burn down my store, you fuckin’ animals!” “Everybody is welcome in this store.” “Anyone can come in.” “One at a time, follow him!” “It’s just a safe space for everyone.” Yeah. John Wayne was born in 1907. That’s what the fuck he’s gonna sound like. Then you got all these douchebags going like, “That’s not an excuse.” It’s like, “Yes, it is.” It absolutely is. You are of your time. Look at these young kids. Remember, for a year and a half, they’d take a water bottle. They’re all standing around and one kid would flip it, and if it landed upright, they’d go… [screaming] “Oh, shit!” And they’d just lose their fuckin’ minds. I didn’t understand it. But I’m born in 1968, so I’m just like, “All right, well, no one tried to slap it out of the way.” “You do it enough times, it’s gonna fuckin’ land upright.” “What is happening here?” Right? I don’t wanna ruin their good time. They’re excited, they’re gonna get on their scooters and ride off. Like a little posse or some shit. I’m like, all right, you can do that. Yeah. So that was like a thing for like half a second. Sean Connery died. The great Sean Connery. Yeah, my favorite James Bond of all time. Yeah. And he was getting a proper send-off for about eight minutes on Twitter, and then the first hairy-leg white chick shows up, right? And she’s just gotta be like, “Really? Really?” “Are we really gonna celebrate this man who advocated the hitting of women?” It’s like, first of all, he didn’t advocate hitting women, okay? [as Connery] He just, “Every once in a while, you give ’em a little slap.” “Yeah, give ’em a little back of the hand, ya remind ’em who’s making the bucks off this shit.” “Reset their hard drive.” That’s all he said, okay? Yes, it’s a crazy statement in 2021. 1976, you know, it’s not good, but it’s not crazy. Right? And he’s born in 1930. You gotta put this shit in historical perspective. I love old movies. You ever watch movies from the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s? Yeah. Any time a woman even has heightened emotion, there’s some guy like, “Get ahold of yourself!” “Yeah, go make me a pie. Put it on the windowsill.” Right? That’s what he grew up watchin’. I grew up in the ’70s. I thought being a truck driver was a cool thing. You know, you had a monkey for a friend. Going around, chicks are showin’ their titties. I thought that that was the world. I had no idea, that’s what I was watching. My thing is, okay, so if you’re gonna cancel all of these fuckin’ dead guys and shit all over them after they’re dead and they can’t defend themselves, why are you only going after men? You know, what about all the horrible women in history? You can’t just go after the men, that would be sexist, and this is what they don’t want. You know? I mean, what about Coco Chanel? Great example. Coco Chanel. Widely considered a feminist icon. She started her own purse factory, right, in the 19-teens or ’20s, whatever the hell she did. I can’t imagine the sexism that she had to deal with, you know. An amazing accomplishment, hats off to her, right? However, she was also a Nazi sympathizer. Yeah. That’s like half her fucking Wikipedia page, just sitting there, waiting for someone to read it. Right out in the open, nothin’. So evidently, what happened was, in World War II, old Adolf came rolling into town, okay, with his tanks with the Porsche engines in ’em, took over the town in like 90 minutes. She freaked out. She closes up her shop, right? Figured out where all the head Nazis were staying, what hotel. She moved in there and she started a relationship with one of the Nazis. Yeah. She started fucking a Nazi. You ever see those Holocaust videos? Huh? With those piles of kids’ shoes? Yeah. She was sucking the dick that did that. Now, just to refresh my memory, what did Sean Connery do again? “Oh, you know, every once in a while, you give ’em a little slap.” That’s what he did. She’s sittin’ there like, “Hey, Adolf, what’s goin’ on?” She so sold out her own country, she had to flee it at the end of the war, and I have no idea how many dicks she had to suck to get back in it. But despite all of that, I still don’t judge her. I don’t, ’cause I’ve never been in that situation. You know, I’ve never been in a country where all of the sudden, the most powerful army the world has ever seen comes in and takes it over in a couple of hours. She must have been terrified, right? And she’s a woman. You know? She’s into fashion. They show up with those Hugo Boss uniforms. You know, her knees buckle a little bit. Things start getting ugly, people are getting shot in the street. She’s freakin’ out. You know. And she’s a woman, and women know push comes to shove when you get your back against the wall. No matter how bad it gets, they always have the option of fucking their way out of a situation. They always got that card they can play. Right? All women know this. Women, all women know this. Men don’t realize this till they go to prison. But women learn this early on. She had the option and she took it. I can’t get mad at her for that, you know? So she’s dead and gone. I think she’s up there in heaven. I think she made it. She’s up there with Sean Connery. Every once in a while, they have a disagreement, he gives her a little slap, you know? She doesn’t care. Once you shit on a Nazi’s chest, a little backhand’s not gonna freak you out. Jesus can’t say anything, he got a hooker, right? Everybody’s got a little something they did. Well, there you go, boom. Still buy your Coco Chanel. She’s still a hero. She was a victim, she was a victim of that time. She was frightened, she was scared. She didn’t know what to do. Uh… anyway. So, we’re living in a fucking weird time. Obviously, beyond all the bullshit that’s going on now, like, every time I think feminism has kind of like died off, you know, you know, like a band you can’t stand and they haven’t put out an album in a few years, you’re like, “Oh, good, did they quit, did they break up?” All of the sudden, they come out with more shit. You’re like, “Fuck, what is it now?” I’m just fucking with you. Feminism doesn’t bug me, you know? It doesn’t bother me. I’m not afraid of it or anything like that, you know, for the simple fact that I know it’s gonna fail, you know? And I take com',\n",
       "  'fort in that, I do. I’m not rooting for it because… I know it doesn’t like me. Um… Yeah, do you know why I think it’s not going to survive, why it’s not going to be successful anyway? ‘Cause they still need men’s help to make it happen. I don’t understand it. I don’t understand why women just can’t work with each other and make this shit happen. They keep coming to us, like, “More men need to care about this issue.” “Where are the men to stand up and say something… yak-yak-yak.” Why do I have to fuckin’ say something? This is your fuckin’ problem. Why are you always dragging us into this shit? I saw a woman a couple months back, professional soccer player, right? She goes onto ESPN on one of these sports channels and she starts bitching, going like, “I don’t understand, how come female athletes don’t make as much as male professional athletes?” Right? And all of these men had to sit there and act like they didn’t know what the answer was. They had to sit there, like, dumbfounded. Like, “Oh, I don’t know.” “Why is that?” “That is a conundrum. I have no idea.” Literally, I’m sitting at home screaming at the TV, “‘Cause you don’t sell any fuckin’ tickets!” Nobody is going to women’s soccer games. You’re playing in a 20,000-seat arena, 1,500 people show up. That’s not a good night. The promoter lost his fucking ass on that gig. I’m not saying no professional female athletes… Serena Williams, the women in the UFC, you know? But nobody’s watching your fuckin’ sport. And then you’re gonna come and you’re gonna get mad at fuckin’ men. They keep doing that shit. Why are you yelling at us? It’s not our fucking job. It’s not my fuckin’ job to give a fuck about women’s soccer, okay? I have men’s sport to pay attention to. This is… it’s your bullshit, right? Dude, look at the WNBA. Dude, nobody in the WNBA got COVID. Nobody. They have been playing in front of 300 to 400 people a night for a quarter of a century. Not to mention it’s a male-subsidized league. We gave ya a fuckin’ league. None of ya showed up. Where are all the feminists? That place should be packed with feminists. Faces painted, wearing jerseys, flashin’ their titties. Goin’ fuckin’ nuts, like the guys do in the upper deck with their big beer titties. “Am I on the jumbotron? Am I doing it?” Yeah. You didn’t. None of you, none of you went to the fuckin’ games. None of you. You all, you failed them, not me. Not men. Women failed the WNBA. Ladies, ladies, name your top five all-time WNBA players of all time. Come on. Let’s hear it. Name five WNBA teams. Name the WNBA team in your fuckin’ city. You can’t do it! You don’t give a fuck about them. They play night in and night out in front of nobody. It’s a fuckin’ tragedy, right? And then meanwhile, you look at the Kardashians, they’re making billions. You look at those Real Housewives shows, they’re making money hand over fist ’cause that’s what women are watchin’. The money listens. You don’t wanna watch this shit, you’re watching this shit. They just shoot it over there, drowning these whores in money and purses and shoes and Botox. It’s just raining. It’s raining money. Yeah. So, the money listens. You’d rather watch that shit, Real Housewives, a bunch of women just tearing each other down. “Well, maybe that’s why your husband left you.” “Maybe that’s why your husband left. That’s why you can’t have kids, bitch!” “That’s why your ass is as flat as your titties, bitch.” Right? That’s the message you sent. “We would rather watch that than see a bunch of women come together as a team and try to achieve a common goal.” “We would rather watch them actually fucking destroy each other.” Yeah. No, no, no. And then in the end, you come back and you fuckin’ yell at guys. And it’s like, let me get this straight, I have to buy you a drink, stop the axe murderer from coming through the fuckin’ window, and I have to watch WNBA games for you? Like, when are you gonna pick up your end of the couch? Yeah. I don’t have any sympathy for women when it comes to shit like that because every study they’ve ever done to determine who’s smarter, men or women, every study comes back and says women are smarter. Every fuckin’ one. Ladies, you shouldn’t be applauding that. You know I’m an asshole. You know this isn’t gonna end well. “Did he say I’m pretty?” “Oh, my God.” Get out of the relationship. If every study says that you’re smarter, okay, the question you should be asking yourself, if we’re so goddamn smart, how are we in the situation we’re in? Well? You’re in the situation you’re in not because of guys like me. As much as you want to blame me, you know? Ladies, you never drove by a sports bar on a football Sunday and looked at the humanity in there? All those dumb guys with their big beer bellies bumpin’ shit. “Hey, he’s on my fantasy team!” “Up top, yeah!” “You wanna get some more mozzarella sticks?” As a woman with your bigger brain, you never looked in there and thought to yourself, “I’m fuckin’ losin’ to that?” “I’m losin’ to that?” Yeah, there’s nothing stopping you. Other than the fact that you guys are just into destroying each other. Oh, now it’s gonna get quiet? I see all that sneaky shit you do. Ladies, if you could just support the WNBA the way you support a fat chick that’s proud of her body and is no longer a threat to you, you know? That league would be doing better numbers than the NBA. Oh, my God, that’s one of the saddest things I’ve ever seen. “Oh, my God, you’re a goddess, you’re gorgeous.” “You look great in that bikini.” “I would kill myself if I looked like that.” “Keep eating, keep eating.” “Lose a toe, you fat bitch.” It’s just… You saw an alcoholic, would you be like, “Oh, my God, look at you.” “You’re facedown, passed out, your kids are crying.” “You’re a hero, you’re a god.” “Keep doing what you’re doing.” You’d be like, “Dude, get your fuckin’ shit together.” “Get off the sauce.” I will say that’s one of the most genius things I’ve ever seen, how regular-looking women somehow mind-fucked advertising to get beautiful women off of billboards. Yeah. Just regular fuckin’ who-gives-a-shit-lookin’ women, right? I’m just being honest. Come on, we’re outside, we’re in the woods, we can be honest. Just regular who-gives-a-fuck… can’t-remember-her-name-looking women. Right? Lookin’ at these goddesses and they had to fuckin’ be… “How am I supposed to compete with that?” You can’t! How fucking arrogant are you? I don’t see Brad Pitt when he takes his shirt off in a movie and, “Oh, great, how am I supposed to compete with that?” I can’t. I am an ugly, bald, orange man. I need to write jokes. I gotta put a lampshade on my head. I know what my role is, okay? I should be on the ground gazing up at people better-looking than me. I don’t know, ladies, this is supposed to be like an inspirational talk. I don’t know if it’s',\n",
       "  ' coming through this way. I’m trying to say, if you really like… If you get through all the misdirected anger of my childhood… I’m trying to say, you’re smarter than we are and there’s more of you. I don’t know. I don’t know what to tell you. I’m trying to be… I don’t know. Trying to be a better person during all of this shit, you know? I am. You know, I got this new thing, man. I try to help out homeless people. You know? Sometimes I help them out, sometimes I don’t. You know, it’s like the mood you’re in, how much they freak you out. You know? So, this is what I do. You got to do something because people at the top don’t seem to be doing anything. I try to bring all my old clothes down to the tent cities to give it to them. It’s a good thing to do, but I gotta tell you something, you gotta do it during the day. All right? You want to do it during the day when they’re tired from Thunderdome the night before, they’re coming down from whatever they’re on, realizing there’s a nail in their shoulder. You want to get them when they’re tired. You don’t go at night. No one’s gonna see you again, you’re gonna end up on a fuckin’ spit. I mean, you’re under an overpass, you never know what can happen, okay? I’m just warning you ’cause they don’t make homeless people the way they made them when I was a kid, you know? When I was a kid, a homeless guy was a bum, he was a vagrant, somebody down on his luck or whatever. You know, a wino. They didn’t have this Shutter Island shit going on that they had out there, like people talking to trees. [shouting gibberish] You’re right here having, like, eggs Benedict. He’s, like, looking through a porthole over your cabbage. Yeah. When I was a kid, you could only be crazy outside for about 15 minutes before a van would pull up and two guys in nurses’ outfits would just come walking out. “Hey, buddy, how’s it going?” “You’re making a lot of racket out here, aren’t ya?” “Why don’t you do me a favor, try this shirt on?” Be like, “Okay. How come the sleeves are so long?” “Oh, because we’re gonna tie your arms behind your back ’cause you’re out of your fucking mind, that’s it.” “Not gonna have you out here scaring the shit out of people.” “Get in the fuckin’ van!” And he got in the van and that was it. They send you to a nuthouse. That’s it, boom, bam, done, nuthouse. But the problem was the people at the nuthouses started fucking the patients ’cause everybody knows crazy people are great in bed, right? So they’re banging away, right? Hey, it happened. You’re groaning at history, all right? You can shake your heads all you want, but… Hey, hey! They fucked those people, all right? And they were banging away, doctors with their fuckin’ lab coats flappin’ in the wind, just banging away, until finally… for decades… finally somebody with a heart came walking in, “Hey, what the fuck is going on here?” And then they shut it down and then they just let all these people go. They all came running out like Mike Myers, jumping up on station wagons and shit. So that’s the thing, you go during the day. And I gotta tell you, when I pull up to one of these tent cities, I always feel good about myself. “This is good, man, helping out a fellow American.” “I would want them to do that for me.” “It’s fuckin’ ridiculous people have to live like that.” That’s what I think when I’m in the car, and then the second I get out and that smell hits me, I’m like, “What the fuck am I doing? Jesus Christ, these people are animals!” Right? I would equate it to the same feeling you probably get if you were on a safari and you’re in the Land Rover, and you look over and you see, like, a leopard. You’re like, “Look at that leopard over there.” Right? Then all of the sudden you go over a bump and fall out of the fuckin’ Range Rover. “Oh, fuck, that’s a leopard!” Yeah, so I pull up and I’m feeling like fuckin’ Uncle Sam. Then I get out of the car and I’m like, “What the fuck am I doing?” I start walking like this. There’s always some sort of movement going on, somebody fuckin’ limping across the street or something. And I’ve never been able to get close enough to talk, really, to anybody. You know, like they do on the news. You know, like, “Jeez, have you been sitting in here, you know, for a couple of months?” “What is it like to be inside of this tent?” I always wondered how many people they had to choke out before they could get that fuckin’ interview. You know, just comin’ in… blow darts. Numbin’ up everybody else. Building a perimeter. So, what I… What I do is I get about 30 yards away, and then I just start walking like this. And then I chicken out, I always chicken out. Thirty yards away, I just go, “Free shirts!” I run back to the car. And that’s when your brain starts playing tricks on you. Like I’m convinced somebody just came running out of the tent with a 2-by-4. Running after me. So I always do a lap around my car before I get in it, you know. ‘Cause homeless people have horrible lateral movement. You know, from all those years of sleeping on the sidewalk, their hips are just junk, you know, like an NFL running back. They slow down like a cruise ship, go right up and over the horizon. So in that time, you go around, you get in your car, you drive away. You drive away. Your closet’s a little more empty. You can go out, you can fill it back up again with shit you don’t fuckin’ need, you know, that’s what you do. [man] America! What’s that, sir? [man] America! America, yeah! America! Don’t think. Just do what you wanna do. Take your dick out, you know? I’ll tell ya, that’s what George Washington was talking about. You know? They really need to shut down the Internet. We are clearly too stupid to all be sharing ideas in this giant townie bar that we’ve created. You guys are all cheering, you’re all on the Internet just like me. I was on the Internet for six hours last night. Trying to figure out what kills a beaver, you know? Does a beaver have a natural predator? No. You wouldn’t know it from all the ignorant shit I’ve said so far, but I am a changed person, believe it or not. I am. I had an experience earlier this year. [man] Bullshit. This is all true. You don’t think so? Guy just yelled “bullshit.” Are you saying “bullshit,” sir, ’cause you don’t believe me or ’cause you don’t want me to leave? Is that what it is? The little angry circle that you’re in? Don’t be goin’ and gettin’ happy now. Don’t be goin’ and gettin’ soft on me. Don’t start huggin’ people and lovin’ yourself. And cryin’ when you see somethin’ cute. Hang onto it! Lash out at people. Reach for your pistol under the seat. Do it! [man] Yeah! No, I took mushrooms back in February for the first time ever. [audience cheering, whistling] This is the perfect state to tell this story. You guys should literally have… you should have mushrooms on your fuckin',\n",
       "  '’ license plate. All right, so here’s the deal. I never fucked with anything like that. I was always a booze guy. Always a booze guy, you know. Yeah, you know. Relax, everybody. I always get nervous when I get white guys going like, “Yeah! All right, whoo!” “All right!” “Build the wall! Yeah!” I’m fuckin’ around, relax. It’s frightening to listen to, but that’s what being a guy is. You’re not allowed to have emotions. So all that shit comes out when you’re drinking. [growling] “Do something dumb so I don’t feel stupid!” So… yeah, I was always like a booze guy, so I never fucked with psychedelics or whatever, so it was one of these deals. I was out in the desert, man, and I was like, all right, I got somebody watching my kids. Everything’s fine, I’m in my fifties. I gotta do it now or I’m never gonna do it, right? So this person, who may or may not have been my opening act tonight, goes, “All right, man.” Uh… He’s a good man, he’s a good man. He says to me, he goes, “All right.” He goes, “Okay, just take like, you know…” You know, it’s always just like, “All right, so, like, how fucked up do you wanna get, all right?” And there’s always like a square and it’s like, “Okay, don’t eat the whole square.” “Just like, bite one corner, lick the other one, and then rub the other one.” “Let it absorb in your face or whatever.” So, I’m like, “All right.” He goes, “How far into it do you wanna go?” I go, “I just wanna trip a little bit, nothing crazy.” So he goes, “Fine,” so I ate just a little bit. I get a little nauseous or whatever. At first it feels like I ate some weed, but then all of the sudden I notice shit that’s not alive looks like it’s breathing, right? Like the refrigerator looked like it just did a lap around the house. It’s kind of… Nothin’ threatening, you know. It needed it, you know. TV started getting bigger. It’s looking like it’s gonna fall on me. All right, and I was doing fine. I was like, “I know that TV’s not getting bigger.” “And if it is, I don’t give a shit, go ahead.” “Spill that pixelation all over me, I don’t give a fuck.” “I know I’m trippin’, I’m having fun. I’m giggling.” I’m laughing and shit, I’m putting things together, and everything is fuckin’ great. And all of the sudden, about an hour in… all of a sudden this profound sense of loneliness and not feeling loved just washed over me. Yeah, and I was just like, “I fuckin’ knew it.” I fuckin’ knew it. This is why I didn’t do it. I knew I had too many demons. I knew I wasn’t going to see God and fuckin’ unicorns and slide down the rainbow and roll around in the grass. I fuckin’ knew Satan was coming up. There was gonna be a guy with a knife and shit. I was just like, “All right, go ahead. Drag me into the abyss.” “Let me see how fucked up I am,” and this feeling, it just enveloped me, and I don’t even know how to describe it, it wasn’t even a feeling. It just was, it just was. So I’m freakin’ the fuck out. I’m sitting there like, “What the fuck?” I can’t get out of it, dude. Like I could walk a hundred fuckin’ million miles, I can’t walk out of it, it just was. So everybody else is, like, trippin’, I didn’t want to fuckin’ ruin their trip, so I’m just like, “All right, dude, I’m just gonna go to the bedroom.” “Oh, look at the refrigerator. Refrigerator…” [laughing nervously] All right. “I’m just feelin’ a little nauseous.” Just playin’ it up, right? Goin’ in the fuckin’ bedroom, and I’m just layin’ down in the bedroom like, “Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?” And every time I thought I felt the bottom, it would just… just further into the bed, further into the bed, further into the bed. So about a half hour later, my wife comes in. She’s like, “Hey, how you doing?” Typical guy. “Great, I’m doin’ great.” “I’m doin’ great.” “It’s goin’ great.” So she’s laying next to me, “I’m feeling a little nauseous, this is a little bit much for me.” And she’s just laying down and I’m just feeling this feeling. Not feeling loved, profound sense of loneliness. So now I’m just looking at my wife, and my brain just starts going like, “Oh, fuck, did I marry the wrong person?” “Why am I lookin’ at…” I know it seems fucked up, but once you’re married long enough, even not on mushrooms, you have that thought every fuckin’ six weeks. You just do. Something happens where you just look at the side of their head and just do the math and just think, “Why did I ever talk to you?” “I could have just walked by. I didn’t even have to say hello.” “We had no relationship.” “We were nothing!” “What would happen if I just never talked to you?” Every six weeks, you think that’s a healthy relationship? That means you’ve still held on to a part of yourself that even though you love this person, you still, you know, you still want to run around like a mustang a little bit, right? So anyways, I’m like, that was freaking me out even more to think of my wife and be feeling that. So I was like, “Fuck, I need to pull the rip cord.” “I gotta get out of this fuckin’… it’s like a giant beanbag.” Couldn’t get out of it, right? So I was like, “Oh, fuck.” Think about your kids. Now, I love my kids. And I know they love me, there is no fuckin’ question. And I start thinking about my kids. And I still felt that feeling. And I was like, “All right, what the fuck is this?” ‘Cause I know that’s bullshit. And I just sort of laid there. And I relaxed. And I went, “Oh, fuck, I know what this is.” This is how I felt growing up. [chuckles] Yeah. This is what the ’70s and ’80s were like. Both your parents worked. You got a set of keys to the house when you were three. “Oh, yeah, son. Get the fuck out of my face, son.” It was fuckin’ nuts, yeah. I grew up in a very, like, angry time, you know? Like, you were afraid of your dad, your dad’s dad. I talked about this shit before, but I’m still working through it, so just bear with me. You just were fuckin’… Yeah, like I love seeing kids nowadays loving their dad. Like, “Dad, wanna go play, Dad? Let’s go ride bikes! Dad!” Yeah, when I was a kid, it was like, “Dad, fuck, Dad!” “Fuck!” “Run! Open a window.” “Mom, what did you see in that?” – Fucking lunatic, right? [man] Yeah! It was absolute fuckin’ lunacy. And not just my house. I love my parents, but it was just the time. Everybody was fuckin’ crazy, you were afraid, and people could put their hands on you and other people’s dads could hit you, and then you come home, “What the fuck did you do?” “I’ll fuckin’ hit you for it!” It was just nuts. Teachers would grab you, dig their nails into your fuckin’ neck. She’d come home, “She wouldn’t have done that unless something happened.” Right? It was all of that shit. Me and my siblings, we all beat the shit out of each other. You know. And then we all teased the dog, and the dog bit all of us. And we never got rid of the dog. One time the dog bit me in the f',\n",
       "  'ace. I was fuckin’ with it, it was eating, I was like… And he latched onto my face like… Like that. My dad had to stitch me up and everything. We still didn’t get rid of the dog, you know? “Aw, he’s a good dog, he had a moment.” “Jesus Christ, you shouldn’t have put your goddamn face down there near the fuckin’ dog.” Yeah. So that’s all it was. It was weird, we were like The Brady Bunch meets Lord of the Flies. Like, on paper, it was great. It was a station wagon full of fuckin’, you know… Norman Rockwell, we went to church, we got Dunkin’ Donuts. Yeah, that was about the fuck… so… I don’t know, so anyway, we all ended up… My dad was one of those people, he said whatever the fuck was on his mind. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know, like that haircut women get when they get to a certain age? They got a couple of kids, they just get it cut a little shorter ’cause they don’t wanna deal with it. They put that little Hillary Clinton flip in it or something. Right? They get it all shaved up the fuckin’ back. First time you bend ’em over, you feel like you’re fuckin’ your friend Eric. Right? You know? But you love your wife, so you lie and you tell them, “Oh, looks good.” “Looks great, I always wanted to fuck Geraldine Ferraro.” “My God, it’s amazing.” My dad didn’t care. We picked my mother up, she got in the car, he just goes, “Aw, Christ, it looks like shit!” “Jesus Christ, what the fuck did they do to you?” “Aw, for Christ’s sake, you look like a fuckin’ man.” My mom’s just sittin’ there like… We’re in the back seat like, “This is what a functional relationship looks like.” Whoo! Yeah. So, because of all that, we all ended up getting, like, physical ailments from being in the fight-or-flight mode our whole lives. Everything, gym teachers were scary, collecting on your paper… Everybody was scary fuckin’ everything. One time my dad told a priest he didn’t deserve to wear the collar. I don’t know how it happened. We were discussing the altar boys’ schedule… and, I don’t know, he wanted to put me on a different mass, and my dad started getting his leg going. “You don’t deserve to wear the fucking collar!” The guy’s jaw was on the ground, and then the best part, next week we go to mass. They haven’t spoken in a week, and my dad comes walkin’ like, “Hey, how you doin’, what’s going on?” Like nothing happened. Yeah, so anyway, we all end up getting these physical ailments. Like one of my siblings has stomach problems, another one has this pain that won’t go away in his back. I remember I had, like, alopecia in, like, the third grade. Third grade, I literally had clumps of hair falling out like I was working on Wall Street, you know. And I was just sitting there like, “Did I pick up all the toys?” “Did I do the dishes?” “He’s gonna find something, he always finds something.” “Fuck, what do I do? I gotta kill him.” “I should kill him, that’s what I should do.” “When he’s sleeping, I’ll take an extension cord.” “I’ll wrap it around, put my fuckin’ foot on his back.” “Billy seems to lack the focus in class that he needs.” “He’s not working up to his ability.” Right? Yeah, so, anyway, I took these fuckin’ mushrooms. All right? And I realized that I have been carrying that shit around and being like, all right, well, that’s why I drank the way I did. That’s why I’ve trashed women the way I… All the fuckin’ shit. I knew every fuckin’ thing I did, good and bad, in that moment. I was like, all right, now I got to get sober and I got to fuckin’ work my way through this shit, because, you know, my wife… I don’t know if you guys noticed, I have a bit of a temper. [chuckles] “No, not you, Bill.” Yeah. So here’s the thing, you know, I’m so fucked up and grew up in such a fucked-up time that I didn’t even think I had a temper ’cause I was like, “I don’t fuckin’ yell at people in my house.” I curse my wife out, I mean we get into it. I get into it with her, but I don’t go like, “Jesus Christ, you fuckin’ bitch,” I don’t do that stuff. I don’t yell at my kids, but what I do is… what I still do is I flip out. So, like I said, I didn’t think that this was a problem. My wife told me it was a problem, but I don’t listen to her, you know. Why would I listen to her? All she does is criticize, you know? I got nothing but bad reviews on the fuckin’ Husband Yelp. It’s just all, “You know, didn’t enjoy the experience.” “Thumbs down, half a star,” never get a fuckin’ “attaboy,” right? So it just becomes white noise after a while. “What, am I doing something wrong again? Oh, yeah, you again, okay, great.” “Great, what did I do this time, huh?” “What do I have to work on?” “Go ahead, fuckin’ let me know,” right? So, I don’t listen to my lovely wife. Like an idiot… Like the idiot that I am, so… One day I learned a harsh lesson, okay? It was a breakfast time. For some reason I had, like, 20 minutes to myself, which is really rare when you got two kids four and under, right? So I’m thinking like, “Holy shit, I can actually make myself a breakfast, like the old days.” “I’ll make two eggs over easy, I’ll make some toast, I’ll make some bacon, fuckin’ burn it up the way I like it.” “It’s gonna be the shit, right?” So I’m having a great time, making myself a Grand Slam breakfast. I sit down to eat, I got the OJ, I got the glass of water. It looks like a picture from a commercial. And right as I sit down to eat, my phone lights up and I get a text message from my buddy. He goes, “Hey, man, I thought you were coming on this Zoom meeting.” “It started five minutes ago, we need you on this.” And I just absolutely lost it. I was like, Jesus Christ, of course I have a meeting. Of course I have my meeting, because why couldn’t I just have one goddamn cocksucking motherfucking moment to myself?! Fuckin’ toast flying all over the place. Flippin’ the fuck up. And then all of the sudden, my daughter, who was like two and a half at the time, comes running into the kitchen with big tears in her eyes, just going, “I sorry, I sorry, Dada. Dada, I sorry.” And I was like, “Oh, shit!” So I literally just squatted down, I was like, “No, buddy, come here.” “I wasn’t yelling at you. Daddy would never yell at you.” “I love you, buddy. Daddy was yelling at the phone, okay?” “Dad yells at the phone when it says stuff that he doesn’t like, okay?” “Your dad has issues. I’m sorry, buddy. I would never yell at you.” And I could literally feel her tears drying in my shirt. I was like, “Buddy, I would never do that, okay?” “I love you. You still love me?” She said, “Yeah.” I go, “Okay, all right, buddy.” And then you know when you do that thing with a kid where you turn them around and push them in the direction you want them to go in? And I just had to sit there like, I just did that to a two-and-a-half-year-old, and she was like walking away, and I’m just sitting there thinking lik',\n",
       "  'e, “How bad was that?” “Is she just gonna go play with a toy and forget about it, or is she no longer gonna be an astronaut?” Like, what did I just do? I thought I was better than my dad, I’m making the same mistakes that he’s making. I fuckin’ hate myself. I didn’t do the meeting, I didn’t eat the breakfast. I just went upstairs, just wanted to be alone, right? Just want to be fuckin’ alone, but I got a wife, so it doesn’t work that way. You know? Especially when you fuck up as bad as I did and as loudly as I did. I knew she was comin’ down the hall. I knew I was going to have to watch some game film. She was bringing the projector, the screen was gonna come down, and I’m literally just laying in there, like, “Please, God, just let her give me two minutes to fuckin’ calm down.” Nope, she just comes right in and she’s just like, “So… you wanna discuss that little incident that happened downstairs in the kitchen?” And I’m like, “No, honey, can you just give me a second?” “My heart is still on the floor. Give me a second. I know I fucked up.” She doesn’t give a shit at that point, and she’s right, it’s her kid too, so she just launched in, “If you think you can do this in this fuckin’ house…” All this shit, and… I mean, she was 100% right, but I wasn’t ready to hear the information. So she just sort of zoned out. “They’re my kids too and…” And I’m just sittin’ there… laying in the bed with the nerve to be upset with her. She didn’t do anything, and I’m just staring at her mouth as it’s moving, not hearing anything. I just started thinking of the news, a news story popped into my head. You know that news story, you’ll see it every year, year and a half. You’ll see some guy, never committed a crime in his life, you know, went to church every week. Helped old ladies across the street. And then out of nowhere, he just kills his wife. It’s gotta be from times like this. It just has to be. He just had something to say. Like, I don’t know, I just fucked up, but… I knew she was right, so I sat there, I fuckin’ took it, you know? I will say, as an aside, the next time you see a guy who never even cheated on his taxes, and then out of nowhere he kills his wife, I think it’s high time to bring back the question, “What did she say?” Okay? I’m just sayin’, all right? Examine the problem from 360 degrees. So anyway, so, I love my dad and everything, you know, but there’s things I want to improve on, so the great thing I have done is my kids are not afraid of me. And every time I have fucked up, I’ve gotten down on my kids’ level and let them know that I was wrong and I apologize. So, the great thing is my kids are not afraid of me. So now, my daughter’s a little bit older, she’s like four and a half now, so now whenever I start flipping out, she actually has been helping me to stop. ‘Cause the second I hear that cute voice, I can’t… I just think, “Dada, I sorry,” I just immediately… It’s hilarious, I’ll be in the kitchen. I’m always in the kitchen doing something, right? And one day I just come in like, “What the fuck kind of toaster is this?” “What was wrong with the other toaster?” “I need to download the app to make fucking cocksucking…” And all of the sudden, she’ll just be like, in the other room, be like, “Dad, don’t scream like that!” The second I hear that voice, I’m like, “You’re right, buddy, sorry.” “Sorry, I’m just gonna download the app here.” “Download the app in the amount of time it would take to make some fuckin’ toast!” Um… “Ooh, Dad, you said a bad word. You said a bad word.” She does all of that shit, right? To the point, one night… We have movie night once a week. It’s my favorite thing, we’ll watch some Pixar thing, you know. One of those great movies, you know. They’re great. They’re for kids and adults. It’s fuckin’ awesome. We sit down, make the popcorn and everything. So we have this smart TV in the living room. Oh, people, this is a smart TV. Oh, is it smart. Oh, is this fuckin’ TV. It’s so goddamn smart that one time I was in there, I had all the lights up because we were gonna watch a movie, but the TV’s so smart, as I’m pressing “on”… which you don’t even do. Don’t hit the “on” button. You hit the “on” button, that fucks it up, you gotta press two other buttons. “Oh, is that what I gotta do? Is that what I have to fuckin’ do?” “Don’t scream like that.” “You’re right, buddy.” This fuckin’ thing, if the lights are out, will not turn on, ’cause it’s thinking, “Well, the lights are out, obviously nobody is in the room.” Well, maybe somebody’s asleep on the couch and they rolled over onto the remote. Meanwhile I’m standing in the dark, “You’re gonna turn on ’cause I fuckin’ bought you and I fuckin’ said so,” right? So my kid comes running. She’s like, “Dada, don’t scream like that.” I’m like, “You’re right, buddy. I’m sorry.” She’s like, “Dada, why do you scream like that?” “‘Cause I paid all this money for this TV.” “I wanna sit down and watch the movie with you, and every time I go to turn it on, it won’t turn on.” “It’s always something.” So she put her little hand on my shoulder, she goes, “Dada, it’s gonna be okay. It’s gonna be okay.” Right? I don’t even think she knows what that means. I just think she knows when to say it, because my wife always says that. “Honey, it’s gonna be okay, just relax. We’ll get you another balloon.” “We can get you another one.” So that’s what she did. She was just going, “Dada, it’s gonna be okay.” Right? She had that little cute hand on my shoulder. And I don’t know, it just hit me, I was just thinking like, yeah. You’re right, it is going to be okay, right? “I mean, I could turn the lights on.” “I can relax. I don’t even need to watch it.” “As long as I’m hanging out with you, this is great.” It was like a profound moment for me for like half a second. Then another moment, then I felt like a loser ’cause I’m like, how fucked up am I that a four-and-a-half-year-old is, like, my life coach, like, dropping these truth bombs on me? So… anyway. So I’m going to try to stay sober until I figure out… Yeah, dude, it fuckin’ sucks, though, I’m not gonna lie to you. Just every day, takin’ life in the face. Praying for sleep. Oh, God, make it end. Fuckin’ hate these happy sober people. “It’s amazing, I feel so alive. I have all this fuckin’ energy.” How long does that take, you know? I drink a milk shake once a week, that’s my big fucking thing. Have a root beer float, oh, it’s just sad. It’s just a sad thing, like watching an old athlete that can’t run anymore. “I used to day drink, man, it was great.” So… Anyway, um… By the way, I haven’t even mentioned how blown away I am that I’m playing in this place. This is absolutely great. [audience cheering] Yeah. It’s hilarious. You stay up here for like an hour with this wind, your fuckin’ lips get all chapped. It’s like you’re s',\n",
       "  'tanding on the front of a boat. So, anyway, let’s end with a couple of silly ones here. We’ll be on our way, right? Let’s see what I did. All right, I’m doing good here. All right, so, here’s a good one for you. A couple of years ago, before all this stupid fuckin’ pandemic shit started, Mother Nature’s half-assed attempt to get rid of the amount of people she needs to get rid of, you know, just procrastinating, treating it like a term paper. Um… I was in New York, I had an acting gig. I was playing a fireman. All right, now, I’m not the best actor, right? Some of you saw it. I hope you paid for it, you cheap bastards. You all watched it for free, you bastards. So, anyways, I’m not the best actor, so I have to look the part, so I grew this giant fireman mustache, big stupid fireman mustache, which looked great when I was wearing the whole fireman getup, and they put the fake dirt on my face. I looked like I’d been fighting fires for 20 years, right? However, the second I took off the costume and they cleaned off my face and I put on my regular clothes, I immediately just looked like some sad old queen that never found love, right? And as luck would have it, I was in New York City in June, which I quickly found out was Gay Pride Month. The whole month. And let me tell you something, the gay guys show up strong. It is wall-to-wall, the fuckin’ island is almost tipping over, there’s so many of them. And I’m sitting there going, “Oh, my God.” Thirty days of this shit. I’m walking around with this orange Freddie Mercury fuckin’ dick broom on my face. I am gonna be getting harassed up and down the street. I was in actor shape, man, I was fuckin’ shredded. I gotta tell you something, man, when I tell you 30 days of June, not one gay guy even fuckin’ looked at me. Forget about even hit on me. I have never felt so old and undesirable in my life. Dude, I’m gonna tell you something, there’s one thing as a man when you get so old that women don’t look at you anymore. Like, you know you’re gonna hit that age, you know that day’s coming, but nobody tells you, at some point, you’re gonna get so old, not even a man wants to fuck you, right? Dude, that is a statement. When you get so old, some queen in his sixties is, “Keep it movin’, I can do better than that.” “Jesus Christ.” “Get some fuckin’ hair plugs or something. Get a spray tan.” “I can get someone in his forties. Come on, keep going.” Dude, I was having this fuckin’ panic attack. I was thinking like, “Oh, my God, I waited too long to get married.” “I had kids too late, I’m gonna die soon.” I was literally wrapping up my life, you know? So I’m walking down like Ninth Avenue, putting a little swish in my fuckin’ step, just tryin’ to get something. I was desperate. Fuck you, ladies, you’ve been there. You know how it is. You wanna think you got one more in ya, you know? So I’m tra-la-la-ing down the street. I really wish that wasn’t the truth. So I’m going down Ninth Avenue, and all of the sudden I looked up, and about two blocks away, I see this lesbian coming up the block. Okay? Now, I know this is Boulder, Colorado, right? So you guys are all like, “Fuckin’, hey, man, you know?” Like, “How did you, like, know she was a lesbian, man?” “Like, that’s not cool.” “You just looked at her and you just knew she was a lesbian?” “You don’t know her, how did you just…” “How do you just know somebody’s a lesbian?” Easy. The same way you do. The same way other lesbians do. It’s not calculus. No, but I understand in 2021, you’re not allowed to say you know “what a lesbian looks like,” right? Judging by your silence, yes, right? Yeah, you’re not allowed, right? What’s funny, if some white kid came in here, like 20 years old, hair slicked back, collar popped, loafers, no socks, you’d be looking at him thinking, “All right, frat boy, date rapist.” “His dad’s a judge. He’s not going to jail.” “Yeah. Just killed five people in a drinking-and-driving accident.” “Already has a new Dodge Challenger on the way.” Right? Yeah, you’re allowed to see that, that you can see. Clear as day. Lesbian. I have no idea. No, but that’s how progressive you guys are. Right? You don’t have any idea. Right? Like, let’s play a game. I’ll just name different people you see and see the slides that come into your head, right? Construction worker. Sports fan. Painter. Skateboarder. Lesbian. Right? It all goes blank. Is that a lesbian? Am I a…? I mean, I have gay friends, but I’ve never noticed any sort of a throughline. Listen, people, I’m not saying all lesbians look alike. I would never say some ignorant shit like that. However, I am saying, though, every once in a while, there’s a fucking layup. Right? Flattop, wallet chain, fuckin’ walking up the street. Right? But even then, I’m not saying 100%. But gun to my head, I gotta go lesbian. Gotta go lesbian. Final answer, final answer, show me “lesbian.” Right? So, anyway… She’s fuckin’ walkin’ up the street. I’m comin’ down, right? And it’s clear to me that if we keep walking the way we’re walking, we’re gonna bump into each other. I don’t wanna bump into a woman, I don’t want to bump into anybody in New York, so I do the gentlemanly thing. I clock what’s going on, so I just gradually shift over into my lane. Now everything’s fine, right? But then the weirdest thing happened. We walk like another 30 yards, and all of the sudden, she drifts back into my lane again. And I’m sitting there walking like, “Wow, that was kind of crazy.” “Thought I solved this problem.” All right, so I fuckin’ dip into another lane again. Okay, I’m walking, we go another 30 yards, she comes back into my lane again. So now I’m up against the curb. So now I’m thinking, how do I do the politically correct math here? What am I supposed to be doing here? Am I supposed to step off into the bike lane and have some young kid on his electric bicycle come by, forty miles an hour, run me over, I go down to the pavement, knees and elbows? And for the rest of my life, every time it rains, I gotta think about this lesbian that walked me off the fuckin’ block? Is that what I’m supposed to do? Am I supposed to give up the whole sidewalk? Like, “Oh, your gayness!” Right? Or do I stiffen up my shoulder and protect my lane? Right? Now, I’m not proud of this, but I chose the latter, all right? I was like, “Look, I’m 53.” “I moved twice. I have an AARP card. I’m the fuckin’ victim here.” So… I stiffen up the shoulder and immediately I’m thinking this is gonna get crazy. I’ve never done this with a female before. This is in public, people are gonna see this shit, what’s gonna happen? But I’m not going to lie, she started closing in, she was moving, so I like leaned in, like I really got my legs underneath me, ’cause she was built like a janitor and I was not gonna get spun around. I wasn’t gettin’ spun aroun',\n",
       "  'd. Not having that on the fuckin’ logbook, right? So I lean into this shit, and at the last second, she turned her shoulder and we just missed shoulders, but our forearms still slapped together with significant enough force that it warranted a turnaround. Okay? Now, I know most of you guys drive, so I will break down pedestrian etiquette really quickly in New York City. This is the deal, if you’re walking down the street in New York, you’re walking and you just sort of brush sleeves with somebody, you don’t have to stop. Just look over your shoulder, “Sorry, man, my bad, have a nice day.” Right? Then there’s the next level. Moves up a little bit. You’re walking down the street, you actually bump into somebody, you actually have to turn around, “Sorry, I didn’t see you.” A little dojo bow, “My bad.” Whatever you have to do… “My sensei”… to keep it from escalating. And then there’s the last one. You’re just walking down the street and you hit so fuckin’ hard, you gotta turn around and go like old-school Dustin Hoffman-De Niro, like, “Hey, I’m fuckin’ walkin’ here! Huh?” “I fuckin’ moved twice, you didn’t see that?” “You drifted two times, huh?” So I turn around to have this confrontation, and let me tell you something, she never looked back. And I’m not gonna lie to you, that bugged me. That bugged me for like three days. Three days, I’m just walking around New York, “Goddamn fuckin’ bullshit, there’s no fuckin’ way you didn’t do that on purpose!” “Who does that, who drifts?” You know? And I’m feeling this anger, it’s just burning me up, and I know eventually it’s gonna settle in my chest, and then one more time it’s gonna be, “I sorry, Dada, I sorry.” It’s like I can’t do this to my daughter, I can’t do this to my kids. So I started reading up on anger. Like, “how to let go of this,” I think is what I Googled. And I found empathy. If you have empathy for somebody, you put yourself in their shoes, you can just, you know, figure out where they’re coming from, where you’re coming from, meet in the middle, so I said, here we go, let me put myself in her shoes. What would cause somebody to accidentally drift into your lane twice? You know, so I just started throwing shit on the wall. Did she have a clubfoot? No. Did she just have a stroke? Did she have Bell’s palsy of her left side? You know? Was she a mummy? Did she have a wooden leg? You know? Is she one of those fuckin’ diagonal walkers? You get behind them at the airport, they’re walkin’ too slow, you go around to the right, they start dragging their suitcase over there. You go over to the left, they’re coming back this way, you know? It’s like they just got off a ship. And everything was just like, no, no, no, cut! Right? And I was still mad. I was still fuckin’ mad. So I said, “Who gives a shit? I don’t give a fuck.” Lied to myself, said I didn’t give a fuck, you know? So then I ended up going home. Then I’m washing the dishes, which is a very Zen-like thing to do. It’s a week later, you wash dishes, you’re not thinking of anything. Your brain is empty, I’m washing the dishes, and then all of the sudden, the answer just came to me. It just floated into my head, and I just looked up. I was like, “Oh, my God. I know why she did it.” I know why she bumped into me. She bumped into me because she’s a lesbian. It was right there. I was, like, looking nine miles down the street, looking under shrubs. It was right in front of my face. She did it because she’s a lesbian. All right, so judging by most of your silence, I will do this math for you, come on. Let’s have a little empathy here. Put yourself in a lesbian’s shoes, all right? Who do lesbians date? Women. Who do they move in with? Women. Who do they get in relationships with? Women. Who do they eventually marry? Women. And I was thinking like, “Oh, my God. I did that.” I know what the fuck that’s like. I know what it’s like to live with one of those fuckin’ things. I know exactly what that… it’s hopeless. Trying to make them happy. “Hey, I bought you this shiny thing. Did I do it right, huh?” Trying to get them to take responsibility for their actions. Not gonna happen. The best you’re gonna get is, “I’m sorry, but…” I know what it’s like to be winning a fuckin’ argument, you’re winning, and then they turn it around, they’re crying, you’re apologizing. You’re thinking, what the fuck just happened? How am I losing this shit? I had you on the ropes. You feel so dumb, you got to go for a walk. And you’re just thinking, how did I lose again? How did I lose again? And then you figure it out, it makes you feel stupid, and then you see some bald idiot with a giant orange mustache, you’re like, “You know what, why don’t you take some of that shit?” “You take some of that fuckin’ anger.” Yeah. I feel so stupid that I got mad at that woman. I shouldn’t have got mad at her, I should have bought her a beer. And just listen to her troubles and had empathy and be like, “It’s not your fault. You married a woman, I did it too.” “You’re not gonna win. There’s no winning this.” Yeah. I’m telling you, if you don’t believe me, do a little people-watching. Take a look at the look on the average lesbian’s face. I don’t mean a lesbian in her twenties, she’s got her life ahead of her, she’s got Christmas in her eyes, right? I mean, a lesbian about 35, 36, starting to settle in to what the deal’s gonna be, right? And then look across the bar, find a married guy about the same age. Look at the look on his face. Look at the look on her face, go back to his face. It’s the same fuckin’ look. Yeah. And then look at gay guys. Some of the happiest people I’ve ever met in my life. They’re almost too happy. It’s like, “Hey, how’s it going?” They’re like, “Hi!” Almost floating across the room with that lack of estrogen just yanking down your fuckin’ dreams. No. Now, look, it might be a front. I’m not saying all gay guys are just blissfully happy, but it’s looking like a pretty good time to me. Dude, they’re some of the most positive people I’ve ever met in my life. Any idea you have, they support it. They’re just like, “Yes, yes, queen, yes!” “You’re fierce, you can do it!” Lesbians are up in the bar like a bunch of jaded cops. “It’s all fuckin’ bullshit.” “What the fuck was I thinking?” “U-Hauling after ten days, moving in. What the fuck was I thinking?” “She’s crazy!” No, I’m telling you, I think married men and lesbians need to start hanging out more, and we gotta put our heads together and try to solve our common problem, the women in our lives. So we can somehow attain the perceived happiness of the average gay dude out there. Yeah. So, if you believe in that shit, I’ll give you some advice. If you’re gonna expand your fuckin’ world of friends, I’ll give you some advice. You can’t just hang out with any lesbian. All right? You gotta make sure',\n",
       "  ' you’re hanging out with the dude in the relationship, right? And by “dude,” I’m not saying she’s manly, I’m not being ignorant. By “dude,” I just mean she’s the one that gets blamed for most of the shit. Right? ‘Cause no relationship is balanced. Somebody is getting away with more. Somebody’s drafting behind the other. It’s like a bike race. Somebody else is taking the fuckin’ weather in the face. [imitates fanfare] Right? Somebody else is fuckin’ right behind. “Oh, yeah, it really is wet.” Just kind of hiding under your fuckin’ poncho. Male-female, female-female, they-they, whatever the fuck it is you’re into. Every relationship, there’s the person that does the dishes and the person that lets them soak. Right? They don’t let them soak. They know you’re gonna do ’em. They’re just waitin’ you out. After a while, you can’t fuckin’ take it anymore. They’re just sitting there. You gotta go start doing them. Then what do they do? They sit in the other room and wait, like they don’t know what you’re doing, and wait till they hear pots and pans, and that’s when the show starts. That’s when they come running in like, “What?” “I was gonna do those!” And you’re like, “No, you weren’t. They’ve been sitting here eight hours.” “I got my hands in room-temperature water with scrambled eggs floating around.” “Don’t gaslight me, you’re a fuckin’ animal.” “You were raised by animals, get out of my sight.” “Don’t yell at me!” Right? Yes. Every relationship has the person that will take the trash bag out of the trash barrel and do a little… Tie it off and then leave it slumped against the counter. Like it took two behind the ear in a mob hit, just… And then there’s the person that actually picks it up and takes it out to the curb at night and puts it in the trash can, right? My wife’s hilarious, I love her, but she’s got some of the worst excuses ever. “Why don’t you ever take out the trash?” She goes, “I would, I’m just afraid of coyotes.” “I’m afraid of the coyotes.” It’s like, “So am I! So am I!” “They’re rabid dogs.” “They hunt in packs of twos and threes.” “You don’t do it ’cause you don’t wanna do it ’cause you know I’m gonna do it, just get the fuck away from me, please.” I’m telling you… So, anyway… I know I said a lot of divisive shit here tonight, so before I get out of here, before I get out of here, I want to… Let’s bring the room together. It’s a very divisive time. Everyone wants to feel safe. Let’s do a nice, normal, mainstream topic, so everybody can drive home happy, no fights, all right? Sound good? All right, great. Let’s talk abortion. There you go. Everybody has an opinion. “It’s my body, it’s my right.” “Well, then fuckin’ drive to Arkansas, bitch!” Right? Everybody has an opinion. As do I, and I apologize that you’re gonna have to listen to mine. Because… I’m gonna tell you right now. I have a really weird take on abortion. I’m gonna tell you that right from the get-go, okay? I’m 100% pro-choice, always have been. [women cheering] Ladies, I said it was weird. For the love of God. Stop getting in the trunk in the car. Wait till the end. You’re supposed to vet me first. Whoo! Fuckin’ feet out the sunroof. I said I had a weird take. Pro-choice always made sense to me ’cause I don’t like people telling me what to do, and I was just like, it’s your body. Who the fuck am I to tell you what to do with your body? So that always made sense. All right? However, I still think you’re killing a baby. See? That’s where it gets weird. Like, I sit on the fence and the whole thing makes sense to me. When anybody’s saying, like, “Don’t tell me what to do.” “It’s my body, my choice.” That’s right, man, she’s right. Leave her the hell alone. “Well, you’re killin’ a baby!” Well, I mean, there is that. You know? If we’re gonna be honest, that is the whole purpose of the procedure. You’re not going in there ’cause you got an earache. You’re going in there ’cause “I got a baby in me, get it the fuck out of there!” Right? You walk in with the baby, you come out without one. What happened to the baby, right? Something fuckin’ happened. So… Pro-choice people like, “Well, it’s not a life yet.” “It’s not a baby yet if…” I don’t know what they say. “Before you do it the first Thursday or the last Tuesday and you spin around one time.” They dance between the right trucks. “It’s not a baby yet,” that’s what they say, which may or may not be true. I don’t know, I’m not a doctor, but I’ll tell you, my gut tells me that doesn’t make sense. It’s not a baby yet. That would be like if I was making a cake and I poured some batter in a pan and I put it in the oven, and then five minutes later you came by and you grabbed the pan, you threw it across the floor. And I went, “What the fuck?! You just ruined my birthday cake.” And then you’re like, “Well, that wasn’t a cake yet.” It’s like, “Well, it would have been.” “If you didn’t do what you just did, there would have been a cake in 50 minutes.” “Something happened to that cake, you cake-murdering son of a bitch!” Right? Now, before all you pro-life people get excited, I think it’s great you’re killing your babies. It’s fantastic. Help Mother Nature out. There’s too many of us. It’s been 130 degrees out. Animals are going extinct. There’s plastic in the fuckin’ ocean. We don’t need any more fuckin’ people. And especially, if you’re honest with yourself, have you done anything great with your life? Is the person you’re banging doing anything great? The answer to both of those questions is no, what are the odds you’re gonna make a great person? I’m not saying you’re gonna make a bad person, you’re just gonna make another person that doesn’t go when the light turns green ’cause they’re staring at their fuckin’ phone. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. This was amazing. [cheering, whistling] Thanks again. Thank you for coming out, everybody.

       " ['Air date: November 14, 2014 [Peretti opens the show with a bit of pre-taped tomfoolery. Lowering her voice to a dramatic, Christian-Bale-as-Batman-esque growl, Peretti monologues over shots of her riding a motorcycle through San Francisco, à la Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. She then proceeds to trace her “history” up to this point, which includes clips from her previous (and fictional) specials with titles like It’s Go Time! (a riff on Eddie Murphy’s brash ‘80s specials), I’m Still Tired and Why Am I Still Talking] [motorcycle engine revs] [instrumental rock music plays] [Chelsea] So many trials and tribulations brought me to this point. All the crazy years of my life stacked on top of one another in a pile of mistaken identities. I did countless hour specials where I looked like a damn fool, trying to be something I wasn’t. Ladies, who’s a whore? We all are. We just need to own it. We’re whores. I’m ugly but I’m a whore. [giggles] I’m a ugly whore. I don’t care. Sometimes I feel like everybody tripping but me. It’s go time! [cheers and applause] Go time! I’m still tired, and I got 12 hours’ sleep last night. I’m still tired. Who’s tired? Who’s tired? Who’s sleepy? I am. I know I am. [chuckles] In all seriousness though, who cares about anything? [sighs] We’ll all be dead soon. But it was time to put everything else behind me and start fresh. I trained with the best impression coach in the world. De Niro. Did you fuck my wife? Killed it, but I still had to go down Lombard Street. At last, I made it to the venue… San Francisco… My hometown Bay Area, the iconic Palace of Fine Arts. An icon within an already-iconic city, so it’s like a double whammy of iconography. I was still so far from showtime. First, I had to go through a rigorous calibration of the lighting environment on stage. This is interesting. This is interesting. I don’t know the terminology you guys use. It’s a little harsh. It’s hitting my eye a little… like, ow. Pure fire. But that wasn’t all. I also had to do a sound check. Ladies! I mean, it’s pretty good. I just want to make sure it can take the volume that I get to… like, what! [heartbeat] ♪♪ All that was left was for me to hit my knees and pray to God to thank Him for all the humility He bestowed upon me… and the supreme gift He blessed me with. I guess you could say I’m a direct vessel of God. It was time to hit the slats with nothing but the clothes on my back. I’m like a loaded weapon, and my brain is the bullet. [audience clapping rhythmically] They were already clapping for me. [chuckles] Me! Imagine that. Okay, we’re at places! Stand by, lighting cue. Spot 2, adjust your beams. You’re just off soft. Spot 1, match spot 2. We want more of a soft glow around the talent! Spot 1 and 2, follow me out to my car. [male announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the show’s about to begin. Please silence your cell phones. No photos, no videos, and do not approach the stage with gifts. [gasps] [security guard] Let’s go. [announcer] And now, Chelsea Peretti! [audience cheers and applauds] ♪♪ Thank you so much for coming out. I’m just like you guys. I’m also a huge fan of my work, and… just really excited to see what I’m gonna do up here… uh, tonight. I am one of the greats. [audience laughs] [giggles] [audience cheers and applauds] One of the top comedians touring the country right now, so it should be a great show. [softly] You’re a clown. You’re a clown. You’re a clown. I like to always get into a stand-up… like, a stand-up stance, you know? Just… I always put my arm here so you guys will be like, “Uh-oh.” [chuckles] “Looks like this comedian’s probably gonna be telling it like it is.” I like to get you in the right zone. Oh, no, I just wish I was someone else. Honestly, I do, all the time. I wish I was a guy. You know what I mean? I just want to feel what it feels like to have male confidence, like, just that feeling, like, it just seems like it must be so amazing, like… My fantasy of what it’s like to be a guy is you wake up in the morning, and your eyes open, and you’re like, “I’m awesome!” [chuckles] “People probably want to hear what I have to say!” Does that sound accurate? “I’m probably gonna do something great today.” I’m always doubting myself. I’m like, gah-ah-ah, you know? Male comedians get to have so much fun. They get to do stuff where they talk about having sex with a girl. They’ll do a joke, “Oh, I was having sex with this girl…” They’ll act it out on the stool. Be like… [grunts] “I was having sex with this girl. I was fucking this girl. I was like…” [exaggerated sexual noises] They’re like… they’ll always use the mic as their dick. They’re like… I’m always just so blown away by their creativity. I want in, you know? So, I’ve been kind of working on my own version of this classic bit… where I just passively take it from the stool. So, in my version, um, you know, I would be like, “So, I was fucking this guy…” [sighs] “Then things got a little crazy.” [audience laughs] [chuckles] That’s my take on a classic. That’s it. That’s my take. Thank you. Thanks. [audience cheers and applauds] Thank you, San Francisco. I hate small talk. I really do. I hate, like, getting to know people. I hate all the little questions you have to ask to get to know someone. If I’m making a new friend, I just want to already be best friends. Or dating, I just want to already be deeply in love. I don’t want to have to trot through all the getting-to-know-you questions. “Oh, whereabouts do ya hail from? Where do ya hail from? I need answers!” Ugh, you know? [shrilly] “Where?” [normal voice] And then it’s like, “Oh, okay, yeah, I’ve never been to that town, but I’ve been to a nearby town, so I can kind of imagine.” [screams] I would like small talk if it were socially acceptable to make those sounds during it. [audience laughs] You’re just like, “Oh, your favorite color’s pur',\n",
       "  'ple?” [screams] Then I would love it. I just hate that feeling when you don’t know someone, and any little thing they say, you have to stretch it out, turn it into something. They’ll be like, “Yeah, we had cats growing up. We were a cat family.” And I’ll be like, “You guys were a cat family? We were a dog family. Uh-oh, uh-oh! Controversy!” Then you find out you’re not that compatible as friends, but you still run into that random person all over town at the local smoothie shop, you know, and you have to be, like, “Oh, my God! You still exist!” They’ll always be, like, “We should do lunch!” The thing that people who hate each other do. “We should do lunch!” I always push it a little bit just to call their bluff. I’m, like, “We should rent a car and drive up the coast. Let’s buy some lumber and learn how to build. I just want to get to know you through task-based projects.” Everyone’s different, and when you don’t know each other well, you can’t read each other as well. Right? like, some people are big casual huggers. They love to hug. They come at you at a party… “Hey!” It’s annoying ’cause there’s no… I don’t really like hugging that much. like, someone I’m not that into… like, I’ll hug my lover while he’s inside me, you know? For the duration, but I’m not a big stranger hugger. I don’t really want your sweaty armpits on top of my shoulder tops. But there’s no polite way to turn it down. like if someone’s coming in… you can’t just be like, “Oh, no, thank you. I’ve already hugged someone today. Thank you.” But I kind of figured out a way that you can thwart an unwanted hug. When someone runs at you like this, you just grab their hands and you go, “Yay!” I also have some little party tricks sometimes I’ll bust out, you know, to lighten the mood at a party. I’ll go up to someone, “Hey, let me show you a party trick. Do you want to see a party trick? Relax your arms. Relax your arms.” And then I’ll just grab their neck as hard as I can, and squeeze it, make lots of eye contact. Just like, “I fucking hate parties.” I do, though. They seem like they’re gonna be so fun, parties, and then they’re just so stressful. like dinner parties, they seem… oh, dinner, food, friends. But then you get there, and it’s so much pressure to have a conversation, and everyone’s gotta pull their weight. And ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba. Da-da, da-da, oh, da-da. Da-da, da-da, da-da. Buh-ba, buh-ba. Is that too reductive? Then there’s always that moment where everyone runs out of shit to say, and everyone’s like… [sighs deeply] I will just panic and be like, “How much money does everyone make?” [audience laughs] “Who’s adopted?” You know. “Who’s ad… let’s find your parents.” Sometimes people will tell you, like, “If you’re… if you have social anxiety, just try to imagine people naked.” And it’s like… that sucks. That’s horrible advice. Watch this, I’ll do it. [scared scream] See? It’s too distracting. I read this woman’s magazine, and it said, “If you feel nervous at parties, here are some conversation starters.” One of the things was “wear a funky necklace.” Wear a funky necklace, and that’ll help break the ice. And I’m just like, “Why not go big?” Why not just walk into a party just dragging a dead dog? [feigns crying] You just kick the door open at a house party. Boom! [crying continues] That will get lips a-flappin’. People will be, like, “Who is that girl? How’d she get in here? How’d the dog die? Why is she wearing a cape?” [trills tongue] [audience laughs] I just got a dog. I got a rescue. – [applause] – [chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. I’m not that into the rescuer identity, you know. I feel like people who rescue dogs are very mouthy about it. They’re like, “He’s a rescue! He’s a rescue! My dog is a rescue. He would have been dead in a ditch. Then I came along…” You know? “I’m his savior. I saved him.” I feel like you’re kinda taking advantage of the fact that your pet can’t talk. Just be like, “All right, chill out though a little bit.” I wish I could text my dog. That is so irritating to me, that I could text everybody in my life that I love except my dog. And he would be the perfect person to text ’cause he’s always home. Okay? He would always be available. I could be uncomfortable at a dinner party, and just shoot him a text, like, [high pitched] “Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing, little cutie?” And then, he’d write back just like, “Nothing… As per ‘uzhe.’ What about you?” I’d just write back, “I feel awkward at this party. I don’t know what to do,” and he’d just be like, “Sniff people’s butts.” I’d be like, “Dude, that’s more your thing. That’s not something I do.” And he’d be like, “Oh, sorry, I can’t read your mind at all times. I’m just trying to help out, I’m sorry. I mean…” [sighs] “Why don’t you just lick your own butt and then try to lick them right here, like right inside their lip… right… right there.” I’m like, “Dude, once again… you’re looking at my life through the prism of your own experience. It’s, like, fucked up.” He’s like, “All right, what about try to go outside? It’s so fucking cool out there. Even if you can just look out a window for a second, I promise you there is shit you can see that no one else can see, Chelsea.” I’m like, “Dude, fuck you.” Click. Then people are like, “Are you all right?” I’m like, “Yeah, I just got in a fight with this guy. He’s a dog.” He’s well trained, though. We trained him to always sit, but on the 15th command. I think he’s able to count it out in his head. He’s very cute. He’s very friendly. He’s not a super-aggressive dog. Sometimes he’ll try to act tough. If a big dog’s coming at him, he’ll be like… [barks] Then he’ll get on his hind legs and look at me in the eyes, like, “Pick me up. Pick me up. Pick me up.” Yes, it’s everything I’ve ever wanted. But you learn a lot about people from how they are with their dogs. Ther',\n",
       "  'e’ll be some big huge dogs staring at my dog from a block away, like his whole body locks up, and then he’s walking all stiff toward my dog like this. And then, the owner’s, like, “He’s friendly. He’s friendly. He’s friendly.” I’m like, “Bitch, no, he’s not. Please reconsider all your friendships. That’s not what ‘friendly’ looks like.” I hate that when someone’s just overconfident, and it’s in direct conflict with reality. “He’s friendly, he’s friendly…” ’cause I’m so insecure I will start to just accept whatever they say. I just hate that confidence. I one time was driving on the freeway, and I saw an old man driving on the shoulder of the road, but he was going 80 miles an hour and driving so confidently that I was just like, “That’s a lane, I guess. I guess it’s a lane.” Sometimes when I get really intimidated by someone’s confidence, I have this little thing I’ll do. When they’re talking to me, I’ll interrupt them and be like, “Have you been crying?” Really works. No matter where their head is at, it really brings them right back down to earth. I feel like when girls are super-confident, walking around with confidence, most of the time it’s ’cause they think they’re hot. Most of time… “I’m hot. This is my world.” And I don’t relate to that because that’s just never been my full identity. When I was a kid, for example, the girls that I’m talking about, they were princesses for Halloween every year. They were like, “I’m a princess. I’m Pocahontas. I’m a rainbow,” you know? I realized the other day that one year as a child for Halloween, I was an old man. Okay? I had some stringy gray hair, and my dad’s old suit. I was like, “Let’s do this! I am the shit!” Everyone was like, “You’re weird.” I was a tarantula one year, okay? Just painting the scene, okay? And then me and these girls, we go off in different directions our whole lives, out into orbit, you know? And then, when your lives intersect later, it can be very strange because super-hot girls don’t understand regular girls’ lives, so they’ll give you very shitty dating advice, for example. They’ll be like, [mimicking] “Okay, he’s playing you hot and cold. Okay, all right. Let me think. Okay, Chelsea. All right, I know what you can do. Okay, just ignore him. Just ignore him for a little bit. Trust me, okay? Just ignore him, Chelsea, for a little bit.” [normal voice] It’s like, “All right, I haven’t heard from him in five months. Thanks for the hot tip.” I’m not saying I’m ugly. I hate when female comedians are like, “I’m ugly. I’m garbage.” I’m just saying that, like, when I get super-dolled-up, the best I can hope for is someone like, “Maybe she’s a philanthropist.” [echoing] Chelsea. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to turn yourself into a punch line. You don’t have to turn all your feelings into jokes. And I don’t want to shit on hot girls either. Whatever, that’s cool. You’re beautiful, great. And there’s actually amazing things that they’re doing right now online. A lot of super-beautiful girls, they’ll… They’ll put a picture of their face online, but they’ll scrunch up their face and stick their tongue out, like… You know? And I’m always so floored by their realness. So inspiring to be so vulnerable with society. There’s also a very powerful movement going on right now on the Internet that, you know, women are kind of, coalition building in a very cool way. I’m talking about the hashtag “no makeup.” Um… You can search it if you don’t believe me, but some brave women are mustering up all their courage, and they will post a photo onto the Internet in which they are wearing no makeup whatsoever. I’m serious. But when they post the photos, they’ll always make a big announcement. In the caption, they’ll be like, [mimicking] “In the following photograph, I, Cassandra… am not wearing any makeup!” Then the whole Internet is like… [British accent] “Ooh-hoo-hoo! Oh, good lady, your bravery is unparalleled. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! We thank you, Cassandra. Please check your DMs.” It just annoys me too because in the no-makeup photos, they never fully look shitty. Like they’re always still in the splits, in a bikini or something like, “No makeup!” It’s like, partial credit. And then the guys fall for it every time. It’s a thirst trap, it’s a trick. And there’s always some guy riding into the comments on a horse like he’s the Lone Ranger, he’s like… [imitates Western film music] He tips his leather hat. He’s, like, “Dear Cassandra, I actually think you look better without makeup.” [imitates grunting] Cassandra is like, [mimicking] “Thank you, thank you. Mission accomplished. Thank you.” If you really want to piss off a really hot girl, like a model-hot girl, go onto her social media, find a photo where she looks smoking hot, and you’re just a regular girl. Go onto her comments and just be like, “People say I look just like you.” [audience cheers and applauds] She’ll be like, “No!” Do you know that women Botox their armpits? This is an actual thing. It’s not to make them look youthful, you know. “Hi, everyone, same old me.” It’s actually to stop them from sweating, because why would you, you know, as a human? But the reason I know about it is I met a girl who did it, and she was like, “It worked. I did stop sweating out of my armpits, but I started sweating out of my butthole.” So, I’m… uh… Is that a good trade? like, kind of a deal with the devil. Then I’m imagining the guy that sees her out somewhere and is just like… “Oh, ho, ho, ho.” He’s like… [constricted laughter] He’s like, [surfer voice] “She is so fucking hot. Her armpits are bone-fucking-dry… just like I always dreamed of.” Then he’s like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa!” That’s him slipping on her butt sweat. “Whoa, whoa, whoa!” He’s like, “I’m so drawn to you, but I can’t get near you! This is a whole new kind of juicy booty.” [audience cheers and applauds] H',\n",
       "  'e’s a surfer. That’s his profession. Why just because you go onto the ocean on a thingy… do you have a dialect? Why just ’cause you have an athletic skill set, do you laugh like… [constricted laughter] It’s like, “Just stop making such a tight circle with your mouth… and then more laugh sounds could get out.” You’re my favorite female comedian, Chelsea! Thank you. Women lie about their age. That’s very complicated, actually, if you think about it. Lying about your age, it’s like you have to remember a different birthday, which would already be impossible for me. You have to remember the music that was popular at a time just before or after you were listening to it, I don’t even know the direction. I would always mess it up like, “I love to sock hop, I mean Tyler, The Creator. I don’t know, I’m old.” Just give up. Again, I feel like if you’re gonna create this whole alternate reality, do something cool with it, like walk into a cafe by your house and just be like… “Huh.” [chuckles] “My God. I haven’t been here in 128 years. Ain’t nothing changed. My God.” Your friends are like, “What? How fucking old are you?” And then you get to be like… [smug chuckling] Uh-uh-uh… Do you guys think it’s worse to wear a Fedora or kill 15 people? Be honest. Sometimes masculinity is so silly. Just the idea that because you’re born a guy, you have to be like, “I’m tough. I’m tough. I’m putting my foot down. I’m tough.” When you guys stomp, do your balls wiggle? Are you like, “I said no!” [trills] It’d take some of the intimidation out of it. And it’s like girls have reputations for being into the dumbest stuff, like purses, shoes, or whatever. What are guys into? Also stupid stuff, like architecture, literature, politics. Motorcycles. Motorcycles are very silly to me. I feel like, why not just unzip your pants, and pull your balls out, and then just walk around town banging pots and pans, just like… like that’s a DIY motorcycle. Everyone’s like, “Oh, okay, he’s a guy.” Men love Daniel Day-Lewis. That’s a real obsession. They love him, right? It’s like, I don’t fully… I’ve sat beside multiple guys in Daniel Day-Lewis movies where they’re just crying silently the whole movie, and I’m like, like, to me it’s like I’m watching a poem for men. I don’t understand it fully. To me, every movie he’s in he’s just like, “You are my son!” Like, that was a dead-on impression. I feel like men, they connect with it ’cause it’s like a male fantasy. They’re like, “What if I was that masculine? What if I had greasy black hair, and I was incoherent?” You know? It’s like the Marlboro Man. It’s the same reason that men love Breaking Bad. They love that show because it’s a fantasy. You’re like, “Oh, if I got cancer, I could probably rule the ghetto.” It’s like, “No, you’d probably just die of cancer. Similar.” [giggles] I just wish that we didn’t always have to live out our fantasies through TV and movies. I wish we could have a little more of our real feelings and fantasies in our day-to-day life, and we didn’t always have to be like, “How are you?” “I’m good, thank you.” Like… I always want to just go to one of my friends’ houses when I know they’re home, and just throw a brick through the window. Hear me out. Just for that moment where there’s that shattered glass hole, to see my friend’s head pop into it. like this. And then I’m on the other side like, “JK! Just kidding.” Just, like, shake it up a little bit. Or when people are standing outside of a movie theater, and after the movie, kinda talking or whatever, I always wanna go up to them and be like, [shrill voice] “Guys, we do need to keep this area clear, okay?” [normal voice] ‘Cause I feel like they’d be like, “All right. That’s that awful voice we listen to.” I hate that. How does that voice count as polite? [shrill voice] “Okay, guys! We do need…” It’s like you have so much hatred in your voice. Just ’cause you’re smiling, that shouldn’t count as polite. You should have to use the word “bitches” in every sentence if you have that much hate in your voice. Just like, “Okay, bitches, we do need to keep this area clear. Thank you, bitches.” [audience laughs] It’s cool to do a show in San Francisco. We’ve been traveling all over on this tour leading up to this, and… [cheers and applause] I can safely say that San Francisco audiences are the best audiences in the country. [cheers and applause] [vacuum cleaner roaring] Does that have to happen right now? Or could you turn it off? Thank you. Thank you so much. It is funny though, like traveling… I’m a pretty good traveler. I did get sick once. I try to avoid getting sick, and by that I mean throwing up. I hate throwing up so much. I come from a shit family, like… You know there’s two kinds of families. There’s vomit families and there’s shit families. And the way you can tell which one you’re from is when you were a little kid and you felt sick, did your parents tell you to shit or to vomit? That’s how you can tell. We were a shit family. So, I hate vomiting. But this particular early morning flight, I drank this green smoothie at the airport that they had prepackaged, and it tasted… [audience gasping] Oh, my God. That is the most fucking Bay Area response imaginable. You’re like, “No! Fuck that. Make ’em fresh, blend ’em up. [cheers and applause] Organic only.” Yes, I know, but that was what was available, I’m sorry. I had to do it. So, I got this pre-made green smoothie, and it tasted garlicky, and I was like, “That’s weird,” you know. But it was 5:00 in the morning, so I drank half of it, and then I was like, “I’m not drinking this.” Then I get on the flight. It’s a short flight, and during the descent, I start feeling like… [groaning violently] But I’m just sitting still, but that’s the feeling. I’m like, “Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.” I start feeling that lip sweat. I’m like… [groaning weakly] “',\n",
       "  'Oh, no. Oh, no.” And I know I seem like a rule breaker and a rebel, but the little “fasten seatbelt” light was on, so I was like, “I can’t get up. Teacher will be mad.” So I’m just sitting there, and I’m like… and everyone around me is acting like nothing is happening ’cause they’re all guys, so they’re like, “This would involve feelings.” So, I’m like, “Ugh.” I’m looking for the flight attendant. She’s already strapped in in the back of the aircraft, just like a little hateful dot in the distance, just emanating beams of hatred as they do, and I’m like… [groaning] to no avail. So, I pull the seat pocket open, looking for the little vomit bag that’s on every flight except this one. In this case, it was not on this flight. So, while I did have the seat pocket open, I just went ahead and… [imitates vomiting] I’m sorry to my family! And of course, the guy next to me is just like, “There’s my light, okay, okay, there it is. It works, it goes on and off, that’s great.” So the flight lands, and I’m like, “I have to tell her. I can’t just walk off,” ’cause it was going to another location after that. And I’m a good person, which I like to tell people. And so, I walk back and I’m like, “Hey, girl. Uh… Hey, beautiful. There is a pile of vomit with my DNA in it, and your name written all over it.” And as I’m talking to her, I have that awful taste in my mouth, so I’m like… [imitates spitting] I spit in the sink, and she’s like, “Why would you do that?” And I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I just… I was… I’m disoriented. If you could just have some compassion…” And she was like, “If you only knew. I’m one of the most compassionate people.” I was like, “When do you bust that out? I’d love to interact with that.” I was on another flight that had an emergency landing. That was terrifying. Here’s how that goes down, if you’ve never lived through it. There’s a little PA announcement, they’re like… [imitates ding] “Are there any doctors on the flight? Are there any doctors on the flight? Please come to the front of the aircraft.” And then you see a few people start walking down the aisle, and you’re like, “Oh, they must be doctors.” Then you hear, “We’re good on nurses.” That’s borderline disrespectful… to the entire nursing industry. Pretty soon they’re just like, “Anybody want to see a dead body?” Anyway, it’s cool. It sucks that we can’t just walk everywhere. I wish we could walk everywhere. We’re so dependent on so many technologies, you know what I mean? Look… [chuckles] case in point. [giggles shrilly] Are you guys silly? [audience laughs] [Chelsea giggles] I’m, like… at this point, I’m so addicted to so many different websites, and apps, and things. I’m honestly thankful when I’m in the shower. You know what I mean? Just the relief of not refreshing anything for… You know, aside from the obvious nooks and crannies. [audience laughs] Cricks and cracks. But there is some really cool stuff that we get to experience in this day and age that our grandparents never got to experience… like that feeling you get when one of your friends leaves their phone or their laptop unattended, and they do not have a password on it, like a dummy. My friend did this recently, and I saw his phone, and I was like… [gasps] I was filled with adrenaline. It’s what I imagine hunting and gathering felt like. I was just like… [gasps] “But this could sustain my spirit for two weeks!” I went onto his phone. I was just like… went onto Twitter. I’m like, “My dick hurts.” Then I was just like… [humming triumphant tune] I went onto Facebook. I was like, “My dick hurts.” [chuckles] ‘Cause I wanted it to be cross-platform, you know? I didn’t know if they were linked. And then I got to sit there and watch the comments roll in… People just like, “Dude, what’s up with your dick? We’re worried about you.” Our grandparents never got to do that. Do you guys think that comments… Internet comments are a good thing, pushing society in an even better and greater direction? It’s a leading question. It’s just weird that any news story that goes online, it’s like any shithead can just write [grunts] “Here’s my thoughts.” I wonder how is that gonna affect our society? How is it gonna shape things? I think about a young comedian starting now, anything they do is gonna go online, and it’s gonna be a million people at every stage of their development, giving them instant feedback. How’s that gonna affect their artistic journey? Imagine if some of the great minds of the past had been around during comment culture. If Einstein had been a young scientist, you know, maybe he would have posted a little theorem up on some science website, you know, just like, “E equals… I’m not sure yet.” You know. And then the first comment would have been like, “What’s up, Jew-fro?! You Jew-ass bitch! Jew, Jew, Jew, bitch, Jew, bitch, Jew.” Einstein would have just been like, “Oh, I’m not gonna do science anymore. It’s too hurtful.” Just pack up his little beakers and hit the road. Maybe get a job at Kiehl’s. [giggles] Did he use beakers? I don’t know. like, what did he do? He invented wing sauce? It’s weird there’s so much interactivity now. I was on Twitter, and someone tweeted to me, and they’re, like, “Get your thyroid checked.” And it threw my entire day into a complete ball of chaos. I’m like, “What? Why?” That’s not even someone being hateful. That’s someone who’s concerned for you. So, I’m Googling symptoms. It’s like, “Bug eyes.” I’m like, “Aah! Aah!” And sometimes you’re just gonna see shitty stuff online… like my friends in… who are also entertainers, they’ll be like, “Don’t search yourself. It’s all shitty stuff. That’s just what the Internet is, and blah-blah-blah.” But sometimes I have to do it. Sometimes I just… ’cause it’s my version of cutting. Like I just… I need to feel something sometimes. And one time I did, and I found this carica',\n",
       "  'ture that someone had drawn of me, and I don’t know if you can imagine what feature they may have exaggerated, but it wasn’t my big heart. I’m looking at it and I’m just like, “You know what?” And I got in the comments. I was just like, “Hey, I hope you and everyone who liked this dies.” And, uh, the artist got back to me really quickly, and he was like, [French accent] “I don’t understand. How could you say such a thing?” like he wasn’t French, but that was his energy. I’m like, “All right, take it down a notch. You’re definitely at a state fair right now.” Not to be a dick, but I’m just saying, is that really art? Can you call it art if someone can guess what you’re gonna do every single time you set pen to paper? like, no one’s going, “Oh, what’s he gonna do with this girl with the buck teeth? It’s a real wait-and-see.” Being a caricature artist, that’s basically like, “Did you hear about the school bully? Yeah, he’s an artist now. Yeah, he’s turned a new leaf, kind of.” And the guy was like, “You’re not that nice, either. You said you hope we all die.” I’m like, “All right, fair point. I hope you live forever as a caricature artist.” [chuckles] “That is my wish.” – Do you guys text and drive? – [audience whoops] [sighs] It’s really hard not to. That’s another thing. It’s like, we have this technology. It’s so hard not to use it, right? If you’re driving to brunch to meet your friend, it’s a 40-minute drive, you get a text from that friend, you see it, you’re not gonna be like, “I’ll just wait till I get there to see if brunch is canceled.” It’s like… it’s hard not to. And then you have those texting and driving PSAs that are fucking terrifying, right? They’re like, “This is the last thing Johnny ever texted before he crashed and died,” you know. And then it’s like, “‘Sup?!” And it’s like, “Was it worth it?” It’s like, “Oh, my God, no. No, it wasn’t.” Nothing we ever text is worth dying over. Unless, I mean… I’m just thinking there is some scenario like, imagine your friend’s being stalked, and the murderer… you know what he looks like. You’re driving by her house like 40 miles an hour. You see that guy running like this. He’s running up her steps like… [trills] And you don’t have time to stop, so you’re like, “Dude, the guy that’s trying to kill you is running up your steps”… Then it’s like, I don’t know. Now we’ve got a dialogue. [chuckles] Now we can reopen that file. We’ll all die of it. But I just wish… I just wish they would have a little… Just a titch more levity with that whole ad campaign. like, if just one out of a hundred of these PSAs, the last thing the guy texted was a dick pic? So, it’s like, “This is the last thing Patrick ever texted before he died.” Then it’s just a dick. And then it’s like, “Was it worth it?!” And then his ghost is just like, “Yes! It was worth it.” He high-fives the camera. “Uh! I needed her to see it!” Felt strongly about it. Anytime I see a dick pic and receive one from all across this great nation… what I think about is what brought the guy to that point. like I just think about the whole process, you know? Not thinking about just the result, I’m thinking about him taking down his pleated khakis… Something got him riled up, the pleats are popping, you know? I see him unzipping, and then I’m imagining he’s not just taking one photo, and then he’s done, you know? I’m imagining it’s gonna be a series of photos, so he’s getting different angles and whatever. Pretty soon, he’s got a phone full of dicks. Then I’m imagining him scrolling through a bunch of dicks, going like, [imitating Evil Queen] “Ooh, come to me, my pretty. Who is the fairest dick in the land?” And then, I don’t know, there’s something kind of gay about it. I just feel like it’s kind of gay. I just feel like, even if you’re a guy, liking a girl is kind of gay, you know what I mean? Like, we wear pink, and we like to smell like flowers. It’s like, “Suck a dick!” [woman] Whoo! I am in love. [giggles] No, it’s nice. It’s nice. It’s, um… [sighs] I don’t like to talk about who I’m seeing because he’s also in entertainment, but like, first name, Denzel, and he’s… He’s really cool, you know? He’s good to me. I don’t know. I’m just glad… I’m glad I’m not on the market anymore. I love it ’cause I remember talking to people, and just like… this one guy would be like getting to know me, and he’s like, “Do you consider yourself to be a positive or a negative person?” I’m like, “Oh, you stumped me,” you know? “I’m gonna go negative because I hate the question so much.” And then, there are just so many little things that will turn me off with someone, just the littlest thing. I remember that guy smiling at one point, and I could hear his smile. like he smiled, it was like… [tinks] [laughs] I was like, “Ah!” like, “Drink water! Please drink a beverage!” That shouldn’t be happening. That’s a medical problem. I shouldn’t be able to hear it when you smile. I definitely shouldn’t be able to have my back to you and be like, “Whoa”… “What are you smiling about, ya silly Billy?” Or someone just rolling a paint roller… in a tray that has about one to two drops of paint in it. Which is it? Yeah, there’s a lot of weird kinds of guys now, like there’s new genres of guys, I feel like. I’m not sure I’m into the “sensitive guy” thing that’s happening, you know, the kind of guys that are wearing these exact pants. You know, like they walk into your coffee shop… and they’re wearing a ratty cardigan and tortoiseshell spectacles, and you’re just like, “Oh, good afternoon, Professor 20-year-old.” You know? I’m not sure I’m into that. I feel like for me to see a guy be super-sensitive and find that attractive… like to see a guy cry and find it hot, the way he’d have to cry is just like… He can’t even put his arms down ’cause he’s so jacked. And the way he cries is just like… [goofy crying] l',\n",
       "  \"ike he’s almost confused by what feelings are. “What’s happening to my face? Why’d I kill so many bears?” That’s the kind of stuff he’s up to. Like Channing Tatum, you know? Ronnie from Jersey Shore, Channing Tatum, that’s my… [sighs] Like Magic Mike… Did you guys see that? – [audience whooping] – Yes! One of the best American films of our century. I did love it, though. It was such a pièce de résistance performance. Um… And I’m extremely religious, and extremely politically conservative, but I saw that movie, I’m like, “I want to fuck Channing Tatum on camera in front of his wife and my boyfriend, our families.” He just brings out that kind of openness and vulnerability. I never had that much luck with Jewish guys. I don’t know, I just feel like, you know… Some of you are gonna disagree, some are gonna agree… It’s kind of a stereotype but it is one of those ones that’s true. They definitely do really want to fuck their moms really hard. Don’t get uncomfortable. Just be like, “Oh, yeah, that’s true.” You know what I mean? It is true, and we just have to accept it. And I think that that tension of that taboo is honestly what causes all the earthquakes in California. I’m serious. I feel like if… Why don’t we just make a day where it doesn’t count, okay? Hear me out. We just make one day where we’re like, “We’re not looking, go, go, go. No one’s gonna judge you. No one’s gonna wag their finger. Just do it. It’s not gonna count.” And I actually think that would make a great movie, like Hall Pass or something, you know? And I want to pitch it to a Hollywood executive, and just feel that out, but I feel pretty sure that that executive would be like, “Um, Chelsea, we’re not gonna make this movie, but I am gonna fuck my mom. That sounds incredible.” Do you guys know that it’s illegal to make jokes about the Holocaust in Germany? Isn’t that funny? Like, to me, that’s such a fascist approach to anti-Semitism. It’s like, “You guys have learned nothing. What are you doing? Hit the books.” I always wanted to be… Tolerance books. I always wanted to be in one of those Holocaust movies where it’s like there’s the beautiful Jewess who can pass for German. And I want to play her. So, it’s just me with my exact face, but in a blonde wig. And I’m just walking around, hanging out with Hitler and his friends, and like, I see a Jew. I’m like, “Shh!” [giggles] They’re like, “What?” Everyone watching the movie is like, “This is miscast. I’m furious.” “Shh.” I was talking to my friend, and he was like, “Hitler was a good speaker.” I’m like, “What are you doing right now?” Like, do you think Hitler’s ghost is sad somewhere like, [whiny voice] “Did I do anything right? Wah… I feel like a failure.” You’re throwing him a bone like, “Here you go, Hitsy.” You know? It’s like, of course he was a good speaker. That’s part of being a dictator and creating a genocide environment. You can’t just walk out like… [constricted laughter] [surfer voice] “All right, you guys. What we’re gonna do, depending on the vibe… is grab a gypsy if you feel like it. Blue-sky thinking, but maybe kill all Jews. I don’t know. Feel it out.” Everyone would be leaving… Just like, “Mmm, Hitler, you suck.” Just tearing off their armband like it’s a shitty music festival. Why are old maps always burnt? Have you ever noticed that like every map you see from the olden times is always burnt all around the edges and in the middle? Where did they used to store their maps at? They’re like, “This is our cooking pit slash map storage unit.” [baby voice] You guys know what I’m talking about, – don’t you? – [barks] Don’t you know? Don’t you know? So, yeah, I’m in love. I’m in love. Just trying to keep leading you guys back to being okay with that, ’cause when I said it the first time, you’re like… “We’re really not here for love. Um… we’re here to laugh at your pain.” [audience laughs] [Chelsea laughs] Anyway, I don’t know. I wanna like… Now I’m in love, so it’s like I gotta figure out, “Okay, now what?” Right? The whole rest of our lives stretch ahead. Do we get [shrill voice] married? Married? [normal voice] I feel like marriage needs re-branding. Do you know what I mean? It’s like, [shrill voice] “We’re married. This is a marriage. I’m his wife, and he is my husband. Wife, husband, marriage.” [normal voice] I just feel like… I like the idea of soul mates, like being together forever, or like Bonnie and Clyde, like, kill people and die, you know? But I don’t know about marriage. The only really cool example I have is my grandparents. They were married 50 years, okay? They had this beautiful marriage. They worked their way up from nothing, they built their dream house, they had a garden together. She grew roses, he grew vegetables. It’s a beautiful marriage. And then I always tried to ask her questions about it to get some insight, like how can I have that kind of longevity and that compatibility, you know. And my grandmother will tell this story where she’s just like, “Well, the day we got married… Grandpa was driving away from the church, and I remember looking at his hand on the wheel, and thinking, ‘I don’t know this man.'” I’m like, what? That’s the story you’re passing down to the next generation? What am I supposed to do with that? Just marry a stranger? Also that’s a pretty shitty story. It has no beginning, middle, or end. It’s just, you were looking at an arm. But she’s told it to me like 25 times. “I don’t know this man.” I’m like, “What is happening?” And they had this great marriage, and then it’s like, okay… then he passed away. So now, even though they had this long, great marriage, now she kind of wanders around her house… she’s like, “Well, guess I better go turn that light off. Then I’ll go round back and turn that light off. I don’t know how all the lights got on!” [chuckles] We got her a dog. We’re like, “Here, t\",\n",
       "  'ake this.” She named it Buffy after the Vampire Slayer, which is cute. – [applause] – Yeah! All my Buffy heads. But it’s weird ’cause she projects all her own nonsense onto the dog. The dog’s just like, “Yay, I’m a puppy!” And she’s like, “Buffy don’t want to go outside. Buffy’s tired.” Buffy’s like, “Let’s go, come on! Let’s go, I’m a dog!” She’s like, “Buffy don’t want to play. Buffy’s feeling morose today. Buffy’s been off her meds for months.” We’re like, “Uh, Grandma, we still talking about Buffy?” My dad, he’s at the opposite end of the spectrum. He’s on his third wife now, so… [sighs] Yeah, cool. Um… I don’t know if you’ve ever attended a third wedding, but there is kind of a different feel to it… maybe a titch less whimsy. You kind of walk in, you’re like, “All right, hey, everyone! Same seats, or… we gonna switch it up?” Just eating cake like, “Dad, dare I say, this cake is even better than all them other cakes.” My dad’s Italian and my mom’s Jewish, then he was married to a black woman from when I was one until I left home. Now he’s married to an Indian woman for his golden years, so it’s really been just a whirlwind of scents, and spices, and silks, and colors. It’s been like some sort of a strange foreign exchange program that just kind of revolves around my father’s penis. My black stepmother, which is what we used to call her… She used to do my hair when I was a little girl, and she would always call me tender-headed. She’d be like, “Chelsea, stop moving! You are so tender-headed!” I’d be like, “Well, I’m really just more of a white person. We kind of have a two-barrette maximum… on what we’re up to with barrettes. Please stop sending me to school looking like Katt Williams. I’d like to do an impression of my dad, but I don’t have a newspaper and five hours to spare. I was so excited when this show was put in The Chronicle, ’cause I was like, “He will have to acknowledge my existence.” Don’t feel sad. Don’t be sad. Um… I’m always looking for just examples of happily married people… You know, just to see someone like, “Oh, that looks awesome.” like, looking for clues in society all the time, and how do people make it work and be fun. like, I’ll watch the “housewives” reality shows, um… just looking for a morsel of inspiration. I remember when those shows first started airing, like 18 years ago, I remember being like, “Oh, my God.” I forgot being a housewife was still an option for women. I was like, “Fuck, I should have done that!” I took a wrong turn. That is so awesome. Someone else works and then you do not work? Like, why did women ever stop doing that on any level? Why did we phase that out? Just out of dignity? I’m not trying to be rude. If any of you guys are housewives, I’m sure it’s a lot of work, but… [audience cheers and applauds] “You should be paid a wage.” No, but sometimes I look at… friends of friends on Facebook, and just kind of observe their lives to see… Do I want any of that? Is there anything I can cherry-pick out of those lives, toss it into my life and make it a better life? A friend of a friend just posted like 500 engagement photos on Facebook. It was a photoset of 500 photos. I’m not exaggerating. It’s like that wedding portraiture, where it’s just like, two assholes back to back in the woods, just like… [laughing shrilly] “To the future!” I’m just obsessed with the entire photoset. I’m just like, “Next, next, next, next, more, more, more, more.” Every photo, they were just like… [giggles shrilly] “Uh-oh, it’s us again.” [trills] This same girl on Facebook, all her posts and all her updates are about her husband. That’s all she seems to write or think about, but she doesn’t call him her husband, which would be awesome, and she doesn’t call him by his name, which would also be great. She calls him by a word that I really feel is one of the more disgusting words in the English language. She calls him her “hubby,” which, to me is on par with the “N” word. Like let’s… Let’s eradicate both. All her updates, she’s just like, “My hubby made breakfast. My hubby fixed the door. My hubby is sleeping. He breathed in, he breathed out. He breathed in, he breathed out.” I just keep waiting for the day where she is like, “My hubby shot himself in the face! His letter said he missed his name… which I just found out is Steven. Missing my hub like a mug.” You have to be so patient to be a parent, you know? My friend, her kid… We were in the park hanging out, and her kid tangled up his kite string, and she’s sitting there with it for 40 minutes like, “Okay, baby, I got it. Over and under. It’s okay, baby. I got it.” And he’s just watching, like… And I’m watching this whole operation, and thinking if that was me, I’d be like, “Oh, my God, we have to throw away your kite! Oh, you loved it. Aw…” [chuckles] [nasally voice] “That is awful. I feel so bad.” [normal voice] I just want a life that has passion. I don’t know. [sighs] I just want excitement. I want to be a good person. I want to be a good adult, have a solid life, but I also want passion and unpredictability. Not like Jodi Arias level, but like something. Are you guys following that… The Jodi Arias? [scattered applause] Cool. [giggles] Me too. Me too. How crazy, we have that in common. Um, no… it’s an interesting one, right? First of all, it’s like, you know, she’s a woman, and murder is mostly a man’s game, so it’s like she kind of broke a glass ceiling in a way. It’s like… I don’t know. Feminism is so complicated. But it’s an interesting case because… [sighs] allegedly, she stabbed him a bunch… It’s her ex-boyfriend… She stabbed him a bunch of times, then slit his throat from ear to ear, then she shot him. It’s like, “Mmm, pick a thing,” you know. In that regard, she really was like a typical girl, where she’s like, [mimicking] “I can’t decide. I’ll have all the desserts.” Well, cong',\n",
       "  'ratulations, guys, on you all just coming out of your houses tonight. That’s so hard to do, isn’t it? [applause] So hard. I hate leaving my house. I’m always amazed when people do it. I’m the happiest when I’m just on my couch, under my blankets, just all cozied up with just my laptop, and my iPhone, and my iPad, and my pee jars everywhere. Just playing bongos on my pee jars. Happy as a clam in my little kingdom. Do you ever do one chore, and then celebrate that for ten years? Or you have a pile of dirty dishes in the sink in the next room, and you hear water, one drop drop into it, just like, “Bloop.” And you’re like, “I know!” That’s my kind of household, but I love it. Sometimes I feel like if these walls could talk, they’d be like, “Bitch, you’re back in bed again?” I’d be like, “Shut up, walls! You’re boring, too.” [chuckling] I do hate it. I hate leaving my house ’cause I have to pee constantly, and I hate asking people… I hate asking people, [nasally] “May I use your restroom?” I hate that, like, [shrilly] “Please, may I?” [normal voice] It’s just so humiliating to ask a business to use their restroom. And I pee all the time. I told my friend that. I’m like, “I pee all the time,” and he’s like, “You’re a frequent urinator?” I’m like, “Um, don’t put a medical flair to it. I pee a lot, okay?” And he’s like, “Is it sticky pee? like, is it like syrup?” I’m like, “No, motherfucker.” How crazy would I have to be that I have sticky pee, and I’m just walking the earth… like I’m just like, “Uh-huh. Yeah, I do, I have sticky pee. Why, what’s up? What’s up? What’s up? What is it? What’s on your mind? What’s the deal? My pee… yeah, it’s like molasses, why? Why do you ask? Just wondering why you ask.” You know. It’s like… if I had molten pee, like, I would be in an ambulance right now. I don’t like peeing in public. I hate that feeling of like, someone being so close to you. I don’t know if you guys do this, but I will actually tilt and try to pee on the side of the toilet bowl ’cause it flattens it and then it’s seamlessly injected into the toilet water, completely silently. And then no one can ever know how forceful my pee stream is. That’s too much intel for a stranger. They’re like, “Chelsea pees like a horse.” It’s like, no. Putting my foot down. I just panic… like, what if I let go, and it’s that kind of lawn-sprinkler pee, you know, that pulsating… Where it’s like… [makes whooshing sounds] Then all of a sudden, you gotta make a joke to your stallmate. You’re like… [forced laughter] “Club music!” I can’t take this stress. like, I’d rather just hold it. I don’t even like eating in front of people. That stresses me out, to be honest with you. I hate the feeling… I don’t want to eat on a business lunch, and I don’t want to eat on a first date. It’s an animal thing… I can’t chew confidently, like… [imitates chewing] You know? My instinct as an animal, when I see meat on a plate, I just want to pick it up and then just drag it off down into a dark hole somewhere, just… [makes gnawing sounds] That’s how I think restaurants should be, just jet black with dirt holes around the perimeter. Just like throw a pan in there. My ideal eating situation is just me in a ditch with a buffet in it. Okay? With no one around for miles, just the wind and the treetops. I’m just naked. I’m just like, “Mmm. Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp, cake, cake, cake. Shrimp cake, why not?” [grunts] And I’m not saying this in a Cathy cartoon way. I’m saying this in a River Monsters way, okay? A Game of Thrones feast. That’s how I want to eat. Just like Sizzler right when the apocalypse hits. That would be my absolute dream. I don’t like eating bananas in public. That is so stressful if you’re a girl. It’s so annoying ’cause it’s such a portable, good snack, but if you’re a girl and you want to eat a banana on the bus or wherever you may be, all of a sudden you’re in the position of like, how do I de-dick this delicious treat, so that I may enjoy it without people imagining me blowing them, you know? So, I have a system again, and I think a lot of us do this. What you do is you peel it, right? Then you break a piece off, right? Then you mash it up in your palm into a paste, and you push it up between your fingers and eat it like… [trills] [laughs] [trills] Right, ladies? ‘Cause you don’t want it to look sexual. That’s a no-no in society. I actually just got some bad news. I just found out I’m allergic to gluten-free food, so it’s a nightmare. It’s gonna be hard to eat in this century. Do you guys know… Speaking of pigging out, do you know that a female pig’s orgasm lasts supposedly for 30 minutes? Ask your mom. That’s a great spirit in here. Honestly, sometimes, I look out at the audience, and I’m just like, “Fuck, I wish I was you.” You know? Just sitting there totally just like, “What’s next?” You know, just totally relaxed, just watching a genius, you know. Just seems like a fun time. Do you guys ever fantasize about having a job other than your own shitty job? like, for me, I do it all the time. For me, what my fantasy job is… is to be a florist. I really feel in my heart of hearts, if I was a florist, I would be happy all the time. It would just be 24/7 nirvana, and I would always have my hair just kind of loosely piled on my head, you know, with just some chopsticks through it, and just long skirts and bangle bracelets, just like… [imitates clinking] And then I would talk to all my customers just really soothing, like, [quietly] “Let me put some extra baby’s breath in there for you.” [giggles] It actually calms me just to pretend to be a florist. “Okay, these will look really nice. That’ll fill that in really nicely for you. There you go. And I’ll put a little ribbon on it. [indistinct] I think that would be really nice.” It makes me feel so good, I should do this every night. “All right, there you go',\n",
       "  '.” And then I feel like, in my fantasy, all my customers would be really handsome male architects ’cause that’s like the perfect guy job, and when I was done making the bouquet, they’d take it and turn it around and be like, “It’s actually for you.” You know, that’s my fantasy of what it’s like to work in the floral industry. I’m sure I’m idealizing it. If I actually got into that field, I’m sure someone would just be like, “That’s not a daffodil, you cunt.” You know. [audience laughs] It’d be a rude awakening. That’s my fantasy. It’s weird being on TV now because then it’s like stand-up… When you do stand-up, it’s all about being relatable. You want to go, “Okay, here’s what my day was, here’s what’s going on,” and people are like, “Oh, I’ve done that, too.” Then you get on TV and weird stuff starts happening in your life. You start going, “Is this relatable?” You know, like… [sighs] For example, nothing really feels like it costs anything anymore. Is that relatable? [audience laughs and applauds] [Chelsea giggles] No, I do love stand-up. I think it’s just cool that you get to say your feelings, and it’s this completely unmoderated experience. like any song you’ve heard, that’s the same thing. That’s just that songwriter’s point of view on what was happening. I always have that Michael Bolton song stuck in my head, where it’s like… ♪ How can we be lovers If we can’t be friends? ♪ ♪ How can we start over When the fight never ends? ♪ ♪ Oh, baby, how can we? ♪ Anyway, yes, yes, it’s a great song. We all love it. [chuckles] I think we can agree. But that’s just maybe Michael Bolton’s take on whatever was going on in that relationship with that girl that he was singing about. Maybe that wasn’t her issue with Michael Bolton at that time at all. like, maybe her song to him would have just been like… ♪ Your hair kind of hit me In the face when we fucked ♪ ♪ I just didn’t like it That was more my issue ♪ [audience laughs] That’s so funny how you know every word to a song, and then, it’s like, maybe ten years in, you realize what it’s actually about. You realize the lyrics, what they’re actually meaning, you’re like, “Oh!” You know? I was thinking about that Dr. Dre song from the ’90s, where it’s like… ♪ Bitches ain’t shit But hoes and tricks ♪ I’m like, “If you actually look within the lyrics… that song is actually not that complimentary to females.” [laughs hysterically] You guys have been really cool. You know, uh… have you? I don’t know. Um… [chuckles] Sometimes when I do interviews, which is constantly, people will ask me, you know, “You’re a woman and you do comedy. Question mark.” like, that’s the whole question. And I never know what to give them, what they want. I don’t know how to describe what it’s like. The best I can do is like, you’re up on stage, and you’re telling jokes, and the whole time, in between your legs, you have a pussy. Sometimes the jokes are going great, you still have one. Other times they’re going… ugh… you still have that same set of genitals. It’s like it’s haunting your every move… no matter what ideas you might be expressing. It’s creepy. like, watch… [grunts] still there. So scary. It is weird being a female comedian ’cause you do hear people talking shit all the time. like, “Fucking female comedians, dude, they fucking suck. All they do is talk about their fucking period, man. Fuck that shit. I have discerning taste. I like fart jokes mostly.” [chuckles] Or whatever their taste may be. But it just annoys me ’cause I have never… just because of that, I’ve never talked about my period the whole time I’ve done stand-up ’cause I don’t want to give anyone the satisfaction. But what annoys me is just on principle, because I guarantee you, if guys got their period, all right? Just make that jump. If guys got their period, there’s no way a male comedian would be standing on stage right now bleeding out of his dick, okay? Just like bleeding, and he’s just like, “I’m not gonna talk about it. I’m not gonna do it. It would be déclassé. I don’t want to disrespect comedy like that. I said no.” You know? If guys got their period, 90% of stand-up comedy would just be people running around like, “I was bleeding out of my dick! What the fuck?! Drip, drop, drip, drop, drip, drop, drip, drop!” Thank you guys very much. [man coughs] [snores] [soft music plays] [instrumental rock music plays] I found a caricature that someone had drawn of my face and I don’t a-know… And I don’t a-know… [laughs] I don’t a-know. Show the audience you’re having a soda. [imitates soda can opening] [burps] Men love Daniel Day-Lewis, you know? [audience whoops] Hoisting my pants. Should I say that again? Or should I just keep all this in? [grunts] [man] This isn’t funny. Can I have my money back, please? It’s not funny? You want your money back? All right. – [click] – [whirring] – There you go, toots. – Great, thanks. – Are you guys awake? – [audience laughs] Just checking in. This will be my life dream. Uh… just making sure you are with me here, as I do perform my jokes for you tonight. Thanks for checking in. I will go off-book.

       " ['[indistinct chattering] [faint laughter] [audience cheering and applauding] Oh! What the fuck, Boston? Goddamn! Thank you. It’s good to be here. Good to be back. Fuck! I love it. Goddamn it! Good to see happy people… having a good time. It’s a tense world we’re living in today. You got a president that’s threatening to fight an ex-vice president. [laughter] You pay attention to that shit? It’s a couple weeks ago on Twitter. Donald Trump said that if he fought Joe Biden, Joe Biden would go down fast and hard. [laughter] I want to get in his ear. I’ll be like, “Let’s make this happen, bro.” [laughter] There’s money on the table. I’ll commentate for free. [laughter] No rules, grow your nails out, wear a diaper. No clothes. To the death. [laughter] Fuck it. Let’s bring this thing totally down. Seems like every day you turn on the news, more and more crazy shit. When are we going to realize we shouldn’t have a fucking president? It’s a ridiculous idea to have a popularity contest to see who controls everything. Because if you could go back in time and grab Thomas Jefferson and bring him to 2018… his first question would be… “You guys didn’t write any new shit? [laughter] Dude, I wrote that with a feather. [laughter] I did it by fire! That’s the only way I could see what I was writing! You lazy fucks! You guys have phones in your pockets and spaceships! ‘But the wisdom of the scroll shall not be adjusted.’ What the fuck does that even mean? Who told you that, bro?” [laughter] We always like to say, “The long, great history of the United States.” Listen, that’s not real. The United States was founded in 1776. People live to be a hundred. That’s three people ago. [laughter] You’re like, “Is he right?” Yeah! The Fear Factor guy just hit you with a fucking math quiz! [laughter] Three people ago! Listen to me, you’re not going to get this from teachers. We used to be monkeys, and we found mushrooms, and now we’re different. And it’s real, real recent. [laughter] No one knows what’s going on. Three people ago, slave owners made boats out of trees, and used the power of the wind to drift across the ocean. They didn’t have a YouTube video to watch first. They didn’t talk to a travel agent. You know what they had? A drawing. Some guy went there and drew it. [laughter] Like, “Are you sure that’s what you saw?” “That’s what I saw! You callin’ me a liar?” And they had a gunfight in the dirt streets. They were fucking savages just three people ago. They took their baby and jumped on a boat and floated across the fucking ocean with their kids. Animals. That’s us. It just happened. Real recent! “I just never saw Trump coming.” Well, you don’t pay attention to trends. We have a very clear trend in this country. We try one person as president, and the next person has to be completely opposite. ‘Cause no one can do the job correctly. So we let someone try it and we’re like, “He fucked it up.” We go with this guy who’s totally different, who’s got our interests in mind. And we always do the same thing. We go right, left, dumb, smart. We give everybody a chance. [laughter] We go Clinton, Bush. Then we go Bush, Obama. Obama, Trump. We just got out of a long-term relationship with a very boring but sensible person, and now we’re dating a whore. [laughter] [cheers and applause] All right? She’s got fake hair. She’s racist. She’s always lying. We don’t care! We’re not trying to start a family, we just want to run red lights and fuck. [laughter] All right? [applause] For real. We don’t know what we’re doing. If this country was a person, we’d be on coke, driving a yellow Corvette, singing Mötley Crüe songs in front of our ex’s house. [laughter] We’re going crazy! [laughter] “Well, it would have been so much better if Hillary won.” [moans] [audience cheers] “Oh, we got so close!” “Oh! We almost had a woman!” Oh, girls, relax. I think a woman can be president. But let’s not use a lying old lady who faints a lot. [laughter] I think you can do better. It’s not that I don’t think a woman can be president. I’m fucking sure a woman can fuck it up just as bad as the men that fucked it up. No one’s going to do it right. But if Hillary Clinton was my own mom, I’d be like, “Mom! You can’t be president. You can’t stand up fast.” [laughter] “I’ll show you! One ring to rule them all…” [groans] [laughter and applause] [in a woman’s voice] “Oh, you’re sexist! I see, you’re sexist! As well as short. You’re fucking sexist!” Ugh! Defuse my point of view. I am sexist. But I’m sexist against men. I decided during this whole Harvey Weinstein thing. This is why. That’s when I realized I was… I had some suspicions… that I might be sexist before that. [laughter] That’s when I really decided. ‘Cause what Harvey Weinstein did, it was fucking terrible. Can you imagine being an actress? You gotta fuck that guy in order to make it. Like, ugh. What a horrible choice. Like, what a terrible position to be in! “This is the only way?” That sucks. That’s fucking… That’s criminal. I think that guy’s a piece of shit. I think he should be punished. But! [laughter] If he had done the exact same thing to men, I wouldn’t give a fuck. [laughter] I wouldn’t even be slightl',\n",
       "  'y upset. [laughter] If I was reading the morning paper and I read a story about a bunch of dudes who let Harvey Weinstein fuck ’em… [laughter] -so they could be in superhero movies… [laughter] I’d read that, I’d go, “Ha-ha!” [laughter] What else? What else is happening? [chuckles] [laughter and applause] I wouldn’t be clamoring for justice. [audience member] Woo! [laughter] If Harvey Weinstein was a woman who looked like Harvey Weinstein… [laughter] and she did the exact same shit to men, my only question would be, “Hey! How bad you want to be Batman? [laughter and applause] How long is it going to take, bro? You could wait tables in this town for 20 years and never catch a break. Or you give the nice lady what she wants. [laughter] Jude Law is in the waiting room and he’s wearing a lobster bib. You tell me… [laughter] if you want to be a winner. [laughter] They don’t fucking give Ferraris away, son! They make ’em by hand.” [laughter] If Harvey Weinstein propositioned my daughter and offered her a movie role in exchange for sex, I, like every other parent in this room, would want to fuck him up. But if Harvina Weinstein… [laughter] came to my son with a solid contract… [laughter] I’d be like, “Dude, you’re gonna be Batman. [laughter and applause] Yes, you are. [cheers and applause] [whistles] Hey, no crying! Batman doesn’t cry! Come on!” “Your own son? Really?” Jaaaaa. What’s the worst thing that can happen? It’d be a harder job. It’d be hard to please Harvina. [laughter] Right? Rich old lady, it’s probably real hard to make ’em come. You gotta make eye contact, you gotta lock in with them. They got to know you’re involved in this project. Right? Rich old ladies are probably super skeptical. [grunts] [laughter] Look. Always, always maintain eye contact. That wouldn’t be the hard part. The hard part is, when you go down on Harvina, she likes to rest her fat gut on your forehead. And the sweat! The sweat gets in your eyes! And it stings like sunscreen! But you gotta keep ’em open ’cause you want a Ferrari! Aah! Aah! [laughter] Nobody cares. Nobody cares about boys that have to eat pussy. No one cares. [laughter] We’re all sexist against men. No one cares. No one feels bad. [faint laughter] “How’d you get that car?” “Man, I had to eat pussy for it.” “You gonna be okay?” [laughter] Feel bad for you. [Joe laughs] [laughter] Look, I get it. Men are gross, ladies. I’m on your side. My favorite example of the difference between the way men and women are treated was always old school Fox News. I used to watch it without the sound on, so it’s almost like watching a wildlife program, just watch them move around. I was watching it once and Megyn Kelly was on, and she was on with Bill O’Reilly. They were right next to each other, so I assumed they were in the same climate. But Bill O’Reilly was dressed like there was a chill in the air. He had a jacket on, a shirt, a tie, and pants. And Megyn Kelly was wearing what would best be described as a vagina curtain. [laughter] Not a good curtain either. Not like one of those Vegas curtains that lets you sleep in late. No, no, no. No, this curtain is like that curtain that sits over Grandma’s kitchen sink. You know that one? [laughter] Kind of flutters in the breeze. You could always see the yard. You know that one? And Megyn Kelly’s on TV with smooth, slippery skin that doesn’t exist in nature outside the dolphin community. [laughter] You’d see her toes. You’d see her feet and her toes. She could just kick off her shoes and there’s a Dorito-sized piece of cloth keeping you from the greatest show on earth. And it’s right there. She knows it’s right there, you know it’s right there and no one’s saying a fucking word. And if she disagrees with you, she’ll adjust the curtain and switch her legs. Hmm. [faint chuckles] Hmm. Nobody says nothing. If I was talking to a dude… and he didn’t have any pants on… [laughter] and he kept switching his legs back and forth… I’d be like, “Hey, man. Are we cool? [laughter] Where the fuck are the rest of your clothes? Why you so itchy? Where’d you get those shoes?” No one says shit while Megyn Kelly’s over there trying to start a fake tan fire in her pussy. [laughter] [blows air] [a clap, laughter] It’s weird. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with it, but it’s weird. She doesn’t have any sleeves on. Where are your sleeves? [laughter] That’s not weird? It’s not weird, it’s strange. “I want you to respect me.” I want to respect you, but you’re half-naked and I want to fuck you, so I’m confused. I don’t know what to do. I’m thinking of saying anything you want. Whatever you want me to say, I’ll say it. I want you to like me more. That’s the problem with a woman that’s that beautiful and super smart. You know she’s smarter than you. She’s a lawyer. She never says “um,” she’s smart as fuck. [laughter] And she’s really, really, really pretty, and she doesn’t have a lot of clothes on. She’s gonna get her way. All right? [laughter] You won’t tell her to go fuck herself. You’ve to be super secure to do that. And you can see some of her tit. [laughter] That’s weird, right? If I came here like this, you’d be like, “Joe, what the fuck are you doin',\n",
       "  'g, man?” [laughter] Right, but if Megyn Kelly’s on TV, “Oh, she’s just got a cute shirt on. It’s just cute. It’s cute.” You could see some tit. You could see some middle tit. You might even see some side tit if you catch… if she’s pointing at something, she might just… “I didn’t even know you were looking at my side tit.” She’ll just pretend. But long as you don’t show the dirty, dirty dark skin. [groans] There it is! [cheers and laughter] The sensitive, forbidden skin! Put it away! It’s not for strangers! [laughter] That’s fucking strange, ladies. Listen, don’t listen to me. I’m a moron. Wear what you’re wearing, it looks great, but it’s weird. You can show some of a sex organ. What if that was the case with dudes? What if we had a window in our pants, we could just see the shaft? [laughter] Right? Just the shaft. [laughter] You can’t see the head of my dick, I’m not a creep. [laughter] Okay? Just a little side dick. [laughter] You have cleavage, we have tubage, it’s no big deal. It’s whatever. Just showing a little tubage. Why do I dress like that? To look cute for my friends. Okay? God! You’re so fucking jealous. I need to get a sip of water. Excuse me for a moment here. [Joe clears throat] I probably should’ve taken this onstage with me, but I’m trying to be cool. That’s that cotton mouth, son. [laughter] [sniffs, clears throat] Woo! [cheers and applause] Yeah, you guys are legal now. I grew up here. We used to hide in the bushes and smoke weed. Ridiculous. Hiding from cops that are now getting high. Going, “What do I do to all those fucking kids? Hoo-hoo-hoo.” [laughter] The real problem is the laws. And Massachusetts finally has good laws. We’ll be able to understand… [cheers and applause] what pot actually is. Florida’s got the craziest laws, ’cause Florida’s trying to protect their pain pill industry. So in Florida, they make it so illegal, this is one of the things they do in Florida: they hire undercover cops to pretend to be high school students. Specifically a hot woman. They hired a 25-year-old hot woman to pretend to be a high school student, flirt with boys, get those boys to sell her weed, and then arrest them. [faint laughter] I don’t like to use the word “cunt.” [laughter] When I use it, I want it to mean something. That’s a cunt. That lady’s a piece of… fucking human garbage. You fucking asshole. Here’s the thing. [laughter] Not only is it not fair, that is one of the most sexist stories you’ll ever hear. Here’s why it’s sexist. It’s sexist against boys. Here’s why. You could never imagine that story if the genders were reversed. If you found out that a 25-year-old man was throwing dick at your 17-year-old daughter, and he talked her into selling him weed, and then he arrested her, we would light that motherfucker on fire in the street. Right? [cheers and applause] But if it was my own son who got arrested by that cop, I’d be like, “How’d it go? [laughter] Tell me what happened. Record? You’re worried about your record? You got a story, dude. You got a… You’re the first guy ever to get arrested by an undercover cop you thought was his girlfriend. [laughter] That’s a fucking hell of a story.” Some people are, like, hard asses about it like, “Shoulda known better. He’s almost 18.” Yeah, but he’s almost 16 too. [laughter] Which is almost 15. That’s like a little kid. Do you remember what you were like when you were 17? You didn’t know what the fuck was going on. And this kid wasn’t even a drug dealer. This kid, it’s not like he got caught. No, this kid was a straight-A student that thought he was getting pot for his girlfriend. He even tried to give it to her. She wouldn’t accept it. She wanted to give him money, so she could arrest him. But he had to know, he was a smart kid. He had to know. He had to know something was off. ‘Cause here’s what it’s like: a 25-year-old woman is not the same as a 17-year-old girl. They look similar, but they’re not the same. Here’s what it’s like: I had this dog once that I got from the pound. [laughter] You know how you get a dog… “Are you comparing women to dogs?” No! [laughter] You’ll see. [laughter] The dog, she was a sweetheart of a dog, but she had been the pound too long, she was real sketchy. And I would bring her around other dogs, and, like, when a dog has been in the pound, like, every other dog they think is going to take their food or take their bed. So I take it to the dog park, and she’d see dogs and go, “Fuck off! Fuck off!” And every dog would be like, “Whoa, Jesus.” [laughter] That’s how she acted with every single dog till one day, one day I brought her to the dog park and somebody brought a wolf. Some fucking hippie asshole with wooden beads on, wearing sandals, this motherfucker brought a thing that eats dogs into a cage filled with dogs! [laughter] My dog looked at that wolf and looked at me and went, “That’s not a fucking dog! Aah!” [laughter] She knew. I don’t know how she knew. She didn’t grow up in Alaska. She wasn’t a Montana dog. How the fuck did she know? But she knew. Somehow. Somehow. That had to be what it was like when that 17-year-old boy was around that 25-year-old woman. Like, “Um, where’d you go to school? Unh? Hmm',\n",
       "  '?” [laughter] She’s like touching him. [groaning] ‘Cause 17-year-old girls don’t sound anything like 25-year-old women. You ever talk to a 17-year-old kid? They don’t know what the fuck they’re saying. They’re basically just practicing talking. [laughter] They’ve only been talking for, like, a few years. [laughter] They don’t know how to make shit sound good. They’re like, “Have you heard the new Drake song? It’s so fire!” You’re like… [groaning] Argh! What the fuck did you do to my ears? Meanwhile the 25-year-old cop’s like, “Let’s go back to my house, smoke some pot, and snuggle.” That kid’s like… “You have a house? [laughter] How the fuck did you get a house?” [laughter] Your dumb friends are like, “She saves, bro. [laughter] My cousin did it, my cousin bought a house.” Kids are always lying. 17-year-old kids. “Yeah, my cousin bought three houses by the time he was four.” What? Four? [laughter] Seventeen. “You should know better.” You know how crazy that is to say? That is a short amount of time on this planet, seventeen years old. And it’s a confusing time. Maybe one of the most confusing times ever for a boy, because your life is a certain way for 13 years, and then you start getting uncontrollable boners right around 13 years in. For 13 years you think you got life mapped out. “I get life, you do what you want, you kind of have a good time. You ride your bike and you play your games, hang out with your buddies.” And then suddenly two years later you’re waking up going, [screaming] “What do you want from me?” [laughter] And your dick’s like… [groaning] Every day. Every day. Confusion. “Do I love you?” [laughter] “What are you gonna do for a living, bro?” Another thing you get when you’re 17. “What are you gonna do? You’re almost a man. Be a loser?” “I don’t know.” And then you see, you see around you all these people that are chasing bullshit. Material possessions and nonsense lives, doing things they hate and getting stuck in a rut. You don’t want it to be you and you don’t know how to get out of that. And everybody’s confused and everybody’s like, “Bro, what are you gonna do for a living?” I don’t know! I don’t know. Just get together with your friends and try to figure life out. Unwind, hang out, smoke a little joint. Like, ‘Dude… [snorts] I think my girlfriend’s a cop.” [laughter] [cheers and applause] I’m like, “Dude, you’re paranoid. Trust me, it’s the weed. There’s no way.” Meanwhile, he was right. Poor little fuck. Nobody cares. ‘Cause nobody cares about boys. Why? Listen, don’t “aw.” It’s okay. We’re running shit. [laughter] It’s the balance of power. Look, it’s… it’s all for good. So much tension. ‘Cause, like, this is a new time for jokes too, because everything I say on this Netflix special is going to get me in trouble, but I… I knew coming in. But I want to explain to people if they’re mad\\xa0at me. Talk to me offstage, I’m super reasonable. But I say shit I don’t mean ’cause it’s funny. Like, people should get that but they don’t get that, not in 2018. Everybody wants to write it down and make it literal. “This is exactly what he said, here’s a quote.” “Oh, hate! Let’s end the hate! Enh!” [applause] And people are way more sensitive now. Because of the Internet, everybody has an opinion and they can all express it, when that’s not really necessary for some folk. Some folks, their opinion’s not that good. They should… keep it to themselves. But today, anybody can express opinions. I’ve gotten death threats for shit I don’t even remember saying. Like, I did a podcast with Tony Hinchcliffe, and apparently I said I thought pro wrestling was gay. [laughter] I don’t even remember saying it. [laughter] But I got off the podcast and I checked my Twitter, and the fucking hurricane of misspelled hate messages that came my way. I was like, “Aah!” What have I done? [laughter] I didn’t even mean what I said. It was just a funny thing to say in that moment ’cause he’s so into it. I’m like, “It’s gay.” It’s funny to say! [laughter] “No, it’s not ever funny to say.” Well, you don’t hang out with my friends. So I don’t know what the fuck to tell you. “Well, you’re a homophobic piece of shit! I wouldn’t hang out with your friends!” That’s not true. Here’s where you’re wrong. I… ‘Cause people tell you that you shouldn’t say something’s gay. But I love gay people. I’ve no problem with gay people. I’m happy they’re a real thing. I really am. I like it, mix it up. Who gives a shit? [laughter] So if you don’t like me calling things gay, then what word would you like me to use to describe gay shit? [laughter and applause] What are we doing here, man? There’s certain noises we can’t make with our face anymore? You know, I think the same fucking thing, right? [laughter] Gay’s not negative. It’s just gay. Okay? There’s certain things… [chuckles] There’s certain things that are gay that have nothing to do with men having sex with each other. Like musicals. [laughter] Right? No one knows why. They’re just gay. Men wearing pearls, gay as fuck. [laughter] It’s not a negative. And I don’t really hate pro wrestling. I was just talking shit. Like, when I was a kid, I loved Jimmy “The Superfly” Snuka, and Bob Backlun',\n",
       "  'd, and Hulk Hogan, and I love The Rock. I go to his Twitter page every day for inspiration. And who’s not a fan of Ric Flair? [audience] Woo! We didn’t rehearse that! [laughter] You knew what to do! That man has an exuberant noise attached to his name. That’s one of the most American things of all time. Right? I was just talking shit. That’s all it was. So Tony goes, “Listen, if you just watch pro wrestling with me, you’ll love it, and you’ll become a fan.” I’m like, “All right, dude. Turn it on.” He turns it on! I see a guy with shaved legs, wearing Speedos, with knee-high leather boots on, and he’s holding another guy down. But not really. [laughter] The guy’s like, “I can’t even get up.” And the guy he’s holding down is wearing a leather mask! I’m like, “What the fuck, Tony! [laughter] Have you watched this with a critical eye?” [uncontrollable laughter] I’m not saying it’s gay. But let’s just be honest. Everywhere else on the planet, other than that ring… [laughter] Everywhere else on Earth, when a dude shows up shirtless, wearing a leather mask and Speedos… he’s there to suck dicks. Okay? Period. [cheers and applause] I don’t care what you tell the cops. That guy knew what the fuck he was doing. So there’s going to be people mad at me for that, but I just want you to know, for a bunch of things. Here’s what’s really important. And I can’t believe you’ve to do this, but in 2018 you’ve to do this. You’ve to say a joke and then you go, “Hey, that’s not…” This is what I really feel. This… this is what I really feel. There’s nothing wrong… I don’t want anybody thinking I’m a bigot. There’s nothing wrong with being gay, nothing, and there’s nothing wrong with being a fan of pro wrestling. [laughter] But it’s the same thing. [laughter and applause] To me. I respect both of them. I think both of them are amazing. I’m super happy. I’ve had some other death threats this year. I, uh… [chuckles] …put a poster up, put a picture up on Instagram of some deer meat, and I wrote, “This is some meat from a deer that liked to kick babies and was about to join ISIS.” [laughter] I was feeling real good about that post. Then I got cocky and I wrote\\xa0hashtag #vegan and that’s where I fucked up. [laughter] Ooh! That wasn’t worth it. That didn’t feel good. Oh! The hate, the anger! Never in my life have I encountered such a ruthless, vicious group of kind, compassionate people… [laughter] as I have in that fucking hashtag #vegan group. [faint laughter] These vegans that are vegans for good reasons, folks, but the problem with vegans is the problem with every single group of human beings. If you get a group of 100 people, just pick a random 100 people, what are the odds that one of them is a fucking idiot? It’s 100%. We nerf all the sharp edges in this world and we let dummies survive. There’s no wolves running through our streets. It’s 100% that one out of 100 is a fucking idiot. Some of those are vegans, and this is how it works: if you got a group and you don’t have to take a test to get in there, some of them are in there for the right reasons. Most vegans are vegans ’cause they’re kind people. They don’t want anything to die so they can live. And those people are heroes, ’cause they’re always tired, they’re cranky, their health’s all fucked up. They’re doing it for all the right reasons. But then there’s vegans who are really only vegans ’cause Scientology didn’t find them first. [laughter and applause] -Okay? You know. Everybody knows certain vegans that would have joined the Taliban if they took the wrong flight, all right? They’re fucking dipshits. Those guys always have “vegan” in their name. It’s always like “vegan warrior.” They just start eating plants and start talking shit. They joined a gang. It’s a plant-based gang. [hysterical laughter] I don’t argue with these people but I do when they say something totally crazy to me. I will check their profile, see what they’re interested in. And this one lady said something really fucked up. She wrote me, she goes, “I hope animals eat your children in front of you. I hope everyone you know gets cancer. I hope you die in your mother’s arms.” And I’m like, “Well. [laughter] What’s this healthy lady up to?” [laughter] [laughs] So I go… I go to her fucking page. She has a bunch of hashtags, right? Normal ones like hashtag #vegan, hashtag #crueltyfree, and then I seen one that I’ve never seen before. It says hashtag #vegancat. [faint laughter] [Joe sighs] I check my watch. It’s 1:00 in the morning, I’m like, “Fuck, do I click this?” [laughter] I’m like, “I should just go to bed, right? I should just go to sleep. I shouldn’t do this. I should have some herbal tea and read a book.” And there’s the other part of your brain like, “Shut up, pussy. Click it. Come on! Come on!” I always listen to that part. That’s the secret to my success, I always listen… [chuckles] “Come on, pussy! Come on!” I click it. I’m hoping… This is what I’m hoping. I’m hoping hashtag #vegancat… I’m hoping what that is is, like, a support group. [laughter] Right? Like, we all have friends that are vegans that also have cats. You go over to their house and you’re like, “So why are you vegan again?” “Well,',\n",
       "  ' I just don’t think it’s our right to decide that an animal should live or die.” And then they open up a fat can of murder and give it to that little fucking psychopath that they live with. And you’re like, “Hey. [chuckles] Hey, man. What’s in that fucking can? What are you doing?” “Well, he’s a carnivore but I’m an herbivore.” If you are a vegan with a pet cat, that’s like being a doctor with a pet vampire. [laughter] Pick a team, fuck face. What are you doing? You live with a murderer! Okay? If you love animals, just shoot that cat right in the fucking head. That thing eats 200 animals a year. [laughter] That is what I was hoping. That’s what I was hoping hashtag #vegancat meant. Oh! But no. No. #vegancat is a whole fucking community of people who think it’s a good idea to feed your cat salad. [laughter] Now, before I go any further, it’s very important that I be completely truthful to you, ’cause people call you out all the time. It’s always some guy. “Actually… Actually you can feed your cat a vegan diet.” They do that little cunt nod. You know that thing that people do? [laughter] They tell you something and then… Oh, is that the worst? Even if they’re right, you’re like, “Fuck you and your facts. This fucking face thing you’re doing.” But he’s right. You can… feed your cat a vegan diet if you don’t mind them going blind… and dying young. “Is he serious?” Yeah, I’m fucking serious. You will, after this show, go on your phone and check out hashtag #vegancat, and you will be treated to a collection of pets that look like they live in a house with a gas leak. [laughter and applause] Every fucking cat is like, “When is the real food coming? What the fuck is…” They’re all lying down! I’m not joking! Every fucking cat. You’re gonna go, “He’s right!” They’re all lying down! All of ’em! And they die young!\\xa0Really fucking young! They take pictures, these fucking psychos. “RIP Tabby! We had five amazing years together!” The cat’s eyes are milky, its legs are stiff. It’s like… “What is this lady feeding me? Where’s the real food, bitch?” It’s a cat! You got to feed it cat food! “Hashtag #crueltyfree.” Tell that to your blind, dead cat, you fucking crazy asshole! -It’s a cat! Okay? [whistles and\\xa0cheers and applause] It doesn’t want to eat mashed potatoes! It makes us uncomfortable that something would want to kill something because what if someone wants to kill us? I don’t want that. That’s what it is. It’s just weird panic that we have about our own mortality. But it’s a real simple system. If this comes up in an argument, feel free to use this. This is how it works: Green shit grows out of the ground, dumb shit eats the green shit, mean shit kills the dumb shit. That’s your cat. That’s why you don’t have to hack your way through a river of bunny rabbits to get your fucking Prius every morning. Okay? You can’t feed that thing cranberries. [laughter] “We went to see Joe Rogan and he hates gays and cats. I am currently blogging about it.” [laughter] None of this is true. I love gay people and I have cats, and my cats are fluffy, which is gay. [laughter] I have gay things that I love. I listened to Miley Cyrus music right before I got onstage tonight. There’s plenty of gay things I love. I have those fluffy, those Monsanto, GMO cats. You ever see those cats? Like, how the fuck did that turn into that? You see a cat in a tundra and then you see my fucking thing. They’re called Ragdolls because, like… I don’t know you, ma’am, but if you came to my house, you could scoop that cat up, they wouldn’t get nervous. “Who’s this crazy lady?” They wouldn’t… Anybody could just pick one of those cats up and put it on their shoulder, and they’d just go limp. [purrs] ‘Cause I have a seven-year-old daughter. My daughter just scoops that cat up like a sandbag in a CrossFit class, and she’s barely got this fucking cat, and they just limp. [purrs] Purring away. So happy to be touched. They have almost no instincts. Almost. Almost! ‘Cause those little fuckers will sit in front of the window. And they see a squirrel across the street, their eyes lock on that squirrel, and they start making these involuntary mouth noises like… [Joe sputtering] [laughter] [repeats it] You ever see your cat do that? It’s so fucking creepy! They don’t even know you’re there. You can get right next to them, like, “What the fuck are you doing, man?” They don’t even look at you. [sputters] I’ve had that cat since it was a baby. It’s never been outside. Three-year-old cat, never been outside. And he sees those squirrels across the street and he’s like… “I remember. [laughter] [Joe imitates a soft growl] I remember the old way.” [growls] How the fuck does that DNA get into that cat? He’s not looking at that squirrel like, “That’s my little friend across the street. I’d like to meet him!” No, it’s like, “Ah! Your neck is right there.” [laughter and applause] That’s crazy. That’s some crazy, murderous DNA. That’s like if you had a science experiment where you had a man in captivity, and you never showed him a woman ever, until he was full grown, and then you show him a naked one through prison glass. And as soon as he sees her, he goes, “Time to fuck! Time',\n",
       "  '… time to fucking fuck!” [laughter and applause] Dudes come over with clipboards. “How do you know? How do you know what to do?” “I know what I know, bro! I know when it’s fuck time! It’s fuckety fuckin’!” That’s what it’s like for that cat. How the fuck does that cat know what to do? [uncontrollable laughter] Explain that to me, science. Cats kill everything they can. Dogs will keep it together. If you’ve a good dog, a good dog will keep it together. Like, you could could have a pet dog and a pet hamster, and that pet hamster, if you got a good dog, that pet hamster could live a long life. [laughter] But you got a pet cat and a pet hamster, that hamster’s got an hour to live. [laughter] And that’s just ’cause your cat’s going to torture it for 59 minutes. That poor little fucker’s like, “I think he’s done! Finally it’s gonna let me get away and I’m just gonna be free!” And the cat’s like, “Not today, motherfucker. Not today. You just stick the fuck down.” It’s what they do. You can’t feed ’em apples. It’s what they do. Dogs care. You can put a hamster on the floor in a room with a good dog. A good dog will look at you, look at the hamster. Look at you, look at the hamster. He’d be like, “Um… -can I fuck him up?” [laughter] “No! That’s Mr. Fluffers! Mr. Fluffers is the newest member of our family!” The dog just starts calculating, like, “Okay, okay. [hysterical laughter] Okay, okay. I like free food. These people are nice to me. Okay. [sniffs] [laughter] That’s a fucking rat, dude. That’s a rat! Okay. Okay. Okay, family. Yeah. Family, family!” You can tell, though, when that dog’s not totally on board, they just get a little too close to that hamster like, “Ooh! I was gonna fuck you up.” [laughter] [a few claps] But a cat, you don’t have a chance. Cats, they will make Exorcist noises. You can try to hold your cat in a room with a hamster, your cat starts going… [Joe caterwauling] [laughter] He’s letting you know, “Bitch, I’m about to claw your fucking eyes out! You’ll never see your kids again!” They don’t care how long you been feeding them. They don’t care about your history of free massages. “There’s a rat on the floor! If you let me go, I can kill the rat!” [loud meow] [laughter] And people keep those things as pets. That’s what’s so fucked up. Imagine if your kid did that, a kid that you couldn’t have in a room with something smaller than him, he’s like, “Gotta kill, Mommy! Murder! Kill!” Like, “Junior, sit down!” “No! Fuck you! Death!” “Well, we just can’t have a pet cat, ’cause Junior breaks the cat’s neck. He’s crazy. I don’t know what to do.” We just accept the fact this fucking cat’s a murderer. Can’t feed that thing cranberries, you crazy bitch. Okay? You’re the monster. Dogs feel bad when they kill things too if you’re mad. Like if your dog kills a hamster and you’re like, “How could you!” [sobs] “How could I? Shit! Did I do that? [groans] Damn it!” “I’m so disappointed in you.” “I’m disappointed in myself! -[laughter] [Joe groans] I’m sorry!” [sobs] [laughter] They walk to you sideways. “I fucked up, dude. Fucking seriously.” But your cat, the cat doesn’t feel remotely bad. Your cat kills something, you’re like, “How could you?” He’s like, “Bitch, you know me.” [laughter] He’ll walk away slow with his tail in the air so you can see his asshole. [uproarious laughter, applause] They don’t care. You scream at him. “You’re a monster!” They pull their ears back. Like, “Why you so loud?” And just lie down right in front of you and lick their own dick. “How about you just shut the fuck up while I lick my dick?” [cheers and applause] [whistles blowing] They don’t care. They don’t care about you. Cats know when you’re high too. They seem to know, you’re vulnerable. Dogs don’t have a clue. You come home high, your dog’s like, “You’re extra friendly today!” [laughter] If I’m watching Black Mirror at 1:00 in the morning, my cat will, like, sit down next to me and be like… “You know you’re going to die, right?” [laughter] [hysterical laughter, cheers and applause] Creepy little fuckers. Something… something spooky about predators, living with a little predator. You know? I think it’s good for us. I think it’s good for us to be nervous. I really do. I think we all need Jesus. [laughter] I grew up… I was raised Catholic for a little while, and then I wised up when I was about seven. And, um… [laughter] Since then, I was like, that discipline is probably pretty good for people. One of the things that gets me about, um, people that are really into Jesus is that you’re supposed to think that Jesus is going to return. But if he did, you’d never believe it. [faint chuckles] Right? Like, nobody believes new miracles. If someone came up to you and go, “Yo, dude. You gotta meet my cousin. He was dead for three days and he came back to life and he hangs out with hookers, but he don’t fuck ’em, he only gives ’em advice. [laughter] Want me to give him your number?” You’d be like, “Yeah, sounds like a good idea. I want to talk to him forever. He sounds totally legit.” [faint laughter] No, we only like old miracles. But I think there’s a new miracle that we might have missed, and I’m going to tell you this story. ',\n",
       "  'There was a woman who was born in Africa, she had a birth defect. She was born without a vagina. Grew to be a full grown woman, she had no other problems. Grew to be a full grown woman, gave a guy a blowjob, and then got into a knife fight. The knife went through her stomach, the sperm hitched the ride on the blade, and landed on her eggs. She got pregnant. Nine months later, by cesarean section, they open her up like a sleeping bag and pull out a normal kid. That’s a real fucking story. You’re like, “The Fear Factor guy just makes shit up to make his stupid fucking jokes work. That’s why they took our phones away, so we can’t call him out on his bullshit.” [laughter] No, I’m telling you a true story. Y’all don’t yell. It’s true. A woman without a vagina gave birth to a kid. Now… here’s my question. Isn’t that a miracle? That seems like a miracle. Like, if you… People that believe in Jesus, you’re supposed to believe he’s going to come back. But if he’s going to come back, do you think he’d come back looking like Jesus? Wouldn’t that be super obvious? We’d see him coming. We’d see the robe and the beard, like, “Dude, that’s Jesus. Hold my hand.” ♪ Kumbaya my Lord\\xa0♪ ♪ Kumbaya ♪ “Oh! Hi, Jesus. We didn’t even know you were coming. This is what we do.” [laughter] Jesus’d be like, “Hmm, I don’t know.” I think if is Jesus is going to return and find out what we’ve really been up to, he’s going to return as the miracle-blowjob knife-fight baby. [laughter] And we’d never even see it coming, ’cause we’re not looking for it. That kid’s got to go to school. Other kids are going to ask questions… right? You remember what childhood was like. Kids are fucking brutal. Everybody’s insecure, so they try to find someone more insecure than them and fuck with ’em. I had a good childhood, but it was weird. And it was weird because my parents split up when I was young, and then my mom lived with my stepdad for a few years before they got married, and we moved a lot. It wasn’t bad, but it was… Kids would ask questions like, “Hey, man, is that your dad?” “No, it’s my mom’s… boyfriend.” “Oh, so it’s a dude who fucks your mom?” [laughter] “Hey, man, I’m eight. [laughter] What about your parents?” “Dude, Dude! My parents have been married since high school. The first time my mom and dad ever had sex, my mom got pregnant with me. Bro… my dad cries a lot. He just cries! He’ll just fall down and start crying. We ignore him now. [laughter] No one cares. Step over him, pass the peas. We don’t give a shit. This poor fucker’s just weeping on the ground. Life isn’t a movie, man. I never saw that in a movie. Life’s not a fucking movie, dude. Life is hard.” “Yeah, man. Yeah, dude, life is hard, dude. It really is. It’s fucking hard. What’s your story, Mutombo?” “Oh, you know! Same old story. Mom ain’t got no vagina. [laughter] Suck a dick, get stabbed. Here I am. [faint laughter] You know, could be worse. Hashtag #blessed.” [laughter] [a few claps] From the humblest of beginnings, he’d be around us as we judged him. Change our ways. We should change our ways. The first thing we gotta do is stop doing this. You know what that is? That’s the symbol of the cross where Jesus was murdered. We got to stop doing this. Start doing this. [laughter] Love… and life. Love and life, brothers and sisters. Don’t get mad at me! You knew why you came here! You get mad. We’re a fucking hour in. If you’re mad now… Jesus Christ! [audience member] Woo! “Your point of view is terrible.” Yeah, it’s how I make a living. [laughter] I say fucked-up shit. You don’t have the time to think up. That’s all it is. Listen. Violence against women isn’t funny. I don’t know why you’re laughing. You guys are assholes. Ass-holes! “Especially in this day and age. -Ooh! [laughter] Oh! Dangerous time. Oh!” My own mom said this to me. She goes… “I just wish that Hillary Clinton was president, because I think it’s about time a woman does the most important job in the world.” Okay. I’m like, “Yeah, but you already make all the people.” [laughter] Like… [cheers and applause] I’m not saying, ladies, that that’s the only thing you can do. You make all the humans. That’s a big fucking deal. There’s seven billion people on the planet. All of them came out of a woman’s body. If babies came out of dude’s dicks, there’d be six of us. [laughter] An abortion would be an app on your phone. All right? It’d be snowing out, you’d pull your phone out, “Fuck this kid. I’m not shoveling snow and breastfeeding.” How about that, ladies? You make food with your tits! You know how goddamn crazy that is? You make the most nutritious baby food known to man, with your tits, while you’re doing other shit. [laughter] ‘Cause no one’s giving you enough credit for it, because so many of you can do it. That’s the problem. Almost every woman can make people. That’s the problem. If only one lady did it, one giant bitch that lived in the middle of the city… [hysterical laughter] She had a huge, clear abdomen with all our children floating around inside of it. We’d bring her food and blessings. That’s just as weird as a baby coming out of a person. We’re just used to our weird. But if that was the way you did i',\n",
       "  't and someone just said, “I’m making my own people. Look.” You’d be like, “Aah!” [laughter] If people didn’t come out of people and then they started, we would freak the fuck out. We’d be like, “What’s next?” No, the problem with the thing is, when you… childbirth, you have to be in the room to really understand it. It’s not like a thing you watch in a video and go, “Oh, I get it.” You think you get it, but you never get to see the kid unless it’s yours. No one lets you watch. Your friends never let you watch. Even my sister wouldn’t let me watch. I go, “What do you think? I’m gonna get horny and fuck you? Come on! Let me see the kid! I want to see my nephew.” Nobody lets you in. Nobody. It’s got to be your kid. By then it’s too late. ‘Cause you see the kid come out, you’re like, “Oh! Oh, okay.” And then you start thinking, “How often is this happening? This is happening right now all over the world!” But you don’t get to see it. There’s a website you can go to where you can see the actual numbers. You can see every time a baby is registered as being born. There’s like a world population number and that number is like this…. [mock buzzing] It’s just fucking spinning. It’s not sustainable. It’s not like, “Well, we gained a few people, we lost a few people. Keeping a healthy balance here on Earth.” No, it’s just people shooting loads into each other, just fucking… [mock buzzing] Eating food and coming in each other. [groans] You just don’t see it. But if there was a place you could see it, like if there was a giant drive-thru movie screen, and it was every baby coming out of every vagina in real-time all over the world, you’d be like, “It’s a fucking invasion!” You’d be like, “Oh my God, now I get it! The vagina is a portal to another dimension. It’s like a well of souls and they’re coming through with pleasure and love and confusing us! And then they grow up and they do whatever the fuck they want! This is how culture gets shaped! From aliens from another dimension!” Ladies… you do that. [faint laughter] You make people. You make all the people. And you want to be president too? You fucking greedy bitches. Jesus Christ! What else do you want? You want bigger dicks than us? You want all the money? [laughter] If I was a woman, I’d definitely be a feminist. 100%. Men are bigger, they make more money, they always try to fuck you, they lie to you. That’s too many things. [laughter] It’s too many. It’s not balanced. I get it, ladies. You know what I don’t get? Men’s rights activists. Every one I’ve ever met, I want to go, “Dude, we got all the rights. [laughter] We got ’em all.” Fucking relax! The problem is, guys that are clamoring for, “What about men’s rights?” They’re going to pay attention to what we do. This is the thing. If girls start doing an audit of what men do versus what women do, it’s a big fucking difference. Men cause all war. That is somehow or another some weird fact that slipped us by. Can you imagine if women caused all the war? How long would it take before we were like, “Yo, we got to kill these fucking crazy bitches. Dude, I came home, the girls are in the backyard making a plane to fly over the ocean and fuck people up they never met. These bitches are bloodthirsty. They never want to stay put, constantly conquering new ground, stealing people’s oil.” Can you imagine? “What about men’s rights?” Shut the fuck up. Stop. Men cause most of the murder. Men cause most of the rape. A guy stops me. “Actually, here’s a statistic you’re probably not aware of. But men actually get raped more than women.” Yeah, by other men, you fucking dipshit! Jesus Christ! [laughter and applause] You’re making my point for me, you stupid fuck. What did you think was happening? When you heard that number you’re like, “No more investigations needed. Clearly there’s packs of cheerleaders out there raping soldiers. We got to put a stop to it.” [cheers and laughter] No, men are so gross, we fuck each other. [laughter] See, I say that and no one gets mad. No men are like, “Bro, you’re fucking generalizing massively. [laughter] It’s such a douchebag move to just criticize an entire gender.” Men don’t care, ’cause I’m one of you, and you know. Like if I say guys jerk off to basketball games, you’re like, “Some of us. [laughter] For sure.” Right? But if I say anything even remotely critical about women, people will get really mad. Watch. [laughter] Ladies, I love you. You’re some of my favorite people. But let’s be honest, you don’t invent a lot of shit. [laughter] Ooh! Feel that? Yeah! That’s some ride-home arguments in the air. Right? You can feel the tension. “No, you were laughing. It’s not funny. You were fucking laughing! It’s sexist! No, he makes fun of men first so he can make fun of women later, you fucking moron. Oh my God, you don’t even know comedy. You don’t even know what you like. Drop me off. Just fucking drop me off. Just… drop me off.” But you know I’m right. Here’s what’s important about this. When it comes to inventions, we’re talking about inventions. Let’s be really clear. I am a fucking moron. Okay? I’ve never invented shit. And I’m guessing you’re probably pretty dumb too, which is why you’re ',\n",
       "  'here listening to me talk. Okay, let’s just be honest. [cheers and applause and whistles] We’re not talking about us. We’re talking about inventors. Okay, it’s not us. Why do we have to be on Team Penis versus Team Vagina on this one? It’s crazy. The men and the women in this room, we have more in common with each other than we do with those fucking freaks out there inventing all the shit we need to make our life awesome. Okay? But those freaks out there inventing shit are almost all dudes. And I don’t know why. But that makes me feel like a winner. [laughter] I feel like I won. I really do. I feel pretty good. And I’m looking around at some of you ladies and you look like losers. You look like you lost. You’re not even in the contest. You’re like, “Hey! [grunts] I don’t like this part.” [grunts again] If you’d your phone you’d be like, “Surely women have invented a bunch of things.” No, they haven’t. I wish they had. Women invented, like, 40 things ever. And it was all shit they needed. [laughter] A woman invented the dishwashing machine. [cheers and applause and laughter] I didn’t even write a joke for that. I’ll let you figure out why you’re laughing. Can’t call me out on a non-existent sexist joke. It’s just a fact. Women invented some very important things, actually. Like, no bullshit, all jokes aside, a woman invented Kevlar, which is the bulletproof material they use for first responder vests. Who knows how many lives were saved because of one woman’s invention? [cheers and applause] But! I bet it was probably a chick who wanted to shoot her husband… [laughter] but she didn’t want him to die, ’cause then she’d have to get a job. She’s like, “Hmm. [cheers and applause] There’s got to be a way to shoot this motherfucker and still sleep in.” Again, I’m a fucking moron! Don’t get mad at me! We’re just talking about inventors. I don’t want to leave any really important women inventors on the list who are all way smarter than me, but, like, one of them was Hedy Lamarr, a gorgeous actress from the 1940s. She invented spread spectrum technology, which is how we use GPS and Wi-Fi today. This one woman did that. But she was hot, no one cared. They were just trying to fuck her. Nobody paid attention to anything smart she said. They had to wait until she died. They’re going through her notes, like, “Fucking Wi-Fi. Hmm.” [laughter] Yeah. ‘Cause we’re gross! I already told you we’re gross. A woman invented the first hypodermic needle. It was one woman’s idea of how to effectively get medication into people. Who knows how many lives she saved? One woman’s idea was computer coding. One woman. She invented the computer code. Without her contribution, who knows? One person. Without this one woman’s contribution, who knows where technology would be today? After that… big drop off. I mean, fucking, like a cliff. The number 11 most impressive invention by a woman is the chocolate chip cookie. Again, I’m a fucking idiot. Way better than anything I’ll invent. But a dude invented the chocolate chip and a dude invented the cookie, and he probably just wanted to go to bed. He was probably like, “You nailed it. You’re an inventor. Goodnight.” She’s got her chef’s hat on. “Write it down. Write it down.” [laughter] I’ll leave you with this ’cause it’s uncomfortable but also true. A man invented the tampon. Let that soak in. Oh! Oh! How’d I do that to you? [laughter and applause] I had to. That’s what you have to say right there. I know. But for real, a tampon is not a good invention. It’s just one of those things that’s been around for a long time, but it’s like a legacy invention. It seems like a male solution to a body part he doesn’t have and a problem he doesn’t understand. Like, “What? What’s going on? Huh? Aah! Just stuff something up there!” [laughter and applause] No woman is ever going to invent a tampon! A woman would have invent a maxi pad. Like, “Hey, hey, stupid. We’re not stuffing anything. We’re just going to take this, put it there, leave it alone. It will be fine.” “Fuck that! We’re gonna make a cotton dick and just stuff it up there. Get in there.” [laughter] “What if it gets stuck?” “I’m going to put a rope on the end of it and yank it out like a fish.” Thank you, Boston! [cheers and applause] I had a great fucking time! I love you, people! [cheering and applause continue] For real, it makes me incredibly happy to be able to do this here. This is where I started. You people are the shit and I love you. Thank you.

All right. Thanks. [laughing] Oh! Story time. Nice. Well, I’ll settle in. Okay. Um… [sighs] Mae, I just got mine replaced. [kisses] [kisses] Hope you backed up the pictures from your wedding. [sighs] Um, can you introduce me? Okay. [clears throat] Can you do the “And now” one? The “And now”? Okay, got it. Thank you. And now, please put your hands together, and welcome to the stage, the one, the only, Mae Martin! [crowd cheering] Hi! [crowd continues cheering] How we doing? [chuckling] Hey. Hi. Nice to see you. Oh my God. This is the best. Thank you so much for being here. What’s… Uh… Okay. [laughs] I have so much to tell you, genuinely. Um… What is everybody’s name? Should we just start… On the count of three, everybody say your name. Ready? One, two, three. [crowd yelling names indistinctly] Hello, uh, I’m Mae. I’m so pumped to be in Canada right now. Just, I really… [crowd cheering] Um, I… I am Canadian. I’m very Canadian. [scattered whoops] But, please, I’ve been living in England for the past 12 years. I’ve been living in London. So I do sound a bit like an asshole. I do have a slight, like, Madonna lilt. And I’m trying so hard to fight it. I’m really sorry. But it’s… My dad’s British. Like very… He’s very, very British. He’s like… My dad’s like a mystical British gentleman. He’s very… He’s a magical man. He’s very into, like, the phases of the moon. He’s… He’s a moon man. He’s into, like, um… He knows all the birds that ever visit his garden and he has a specific relationship with each bird. And my childhood, like my whole childhood, was pretty mystical. Like, the best example I can think of… Okay, when I was about eight years old, my dad was driving my brother and I to karate class. And it was a very Canadian scene. It’s like 5:00 p.m., the sun’s already going down. It’s snowing, we’re on the highway. We’re going to the karate dojo. Me and my brother in the backseat. I’m eight, my brother’s 12. I was a green belt in karate, my brother was a yellow belt. So he was four years older, two belts lower. Um… Which is not important, but I thought I would flag it. And, uh, we’re driving along the highway and suddenly my dad, like, swerves to the side of the highway in, like, a panicked move. And tires are screeching, people are honking. Really dangerous. He pulls over, and he’s really shaken up, and he goes, [British accent] “I’m so sorry, children, but we have to get out of the car.” [regular accent] We’re like, “What?” And so we get out of the car. We’re standing by the side of the highway, in the snow. My brother, 12 years old, so embarrassed, he’s like, in his karate uniform. And people are driving by, they’re like, “Is he a yellow belt? ‘Cause…” “Hang on a second. He looks older…” “We’re gonna turn the car around. Check this out.” And so we’re like, “What is going on?” And my dad goes, “I’ve just seen the new moon through glass.” So, he had seen the sliver of the new moon through the windshield and we had to pull over, get out of the car, and he made us bow to the moon three times. We had to do this whole ritual. We had to say, “Good evening, Lady Moon.” It was… It was mystical. He’s a moon man. He’s deep into the moon. And, um, I was just visiting recently, uh, visiting home. This is my childhood home that I grew up in, and they’ve had it since long before I was born. And I’m in the kitchen with my mom and dad, and my dad comes up to me and goes, “Meet me in the study at dusk.” I’m like, “But I…” I go to my mom, I’m like, “What time is dusk?” She’s like, “I don’t know.” [laughs] And I go up to the study, which is like… It’s been many things over the years, it’s been like a spare room or whatever. My dad’s there with a glass of wine, looking out the window. He wanted to show me there’s a family of raccoons that lives in a tree in the neighbor’s yard. And, like, every night at dusk, they emerge, and he’s got, yeah, a relationship with them all. Um… So, we’re standing, waiting for the raccoons, and he just really dreamily goes, um… “Do you know you were conceived in this room?” Which… So I was like, “Oh…” And I don’t like to shut him down when he’s being vulnerable, so… I was like, “Wait. You remember the specific night that I was conceived?” And he said this phrase, which truly has haunted me ever since. He said, he goes, “Yes, of course I remember it.” “I remember it well.” This is what he said. “The moonlight shone in over your mother’s bottom.” [crowd gasps, laughs] Over your… I feel like you’re not fully getting, like… I now know the position I was conceived in. I’m horrified. Nobody wants to be conceived doggy style. It’s so bleak. You don’t want… You want to be conceived face to face. Eye contact. At the moment of ejaculation, just like we… “We’re making a choice to make a life.” Not like, “Ah! Bite the pillow!” It’s horrible. It’s… It’s bleak. It’s like… It’s changed how I see myself. Like, how I… I’m like, “I’m a doggy-style baby.” [crowd laughing] Makes a lot of sense, actually. Explains a lot. It’s, like, affected my posture. I’m just a little more… I’m like… Just a little hunched. [laughs] I feel like I can spot other doggy-style babies when I’m out in the world, 100%, there’s… I’ll be getting on the subway, and there’s someone… [grunting] Smoking on the subway. I’m like, “Oh, yeah.” Or I’ll be in a bar, and the bartender’s like, “Sorry, someone’s just sent you a drink.” I look down the bar, and… [grunting] Another doggy-style baby. There’s some in here tonight. I can see us. Several. [Mae laughs] They… Every time I go home to visit, something like this happens. Something that derails my… my grasp on reality. Like, um, okay, my parents have this anecdote, and it’s a story they’ve been telling my whole life. Li',\n",
       "  'ke, once a year, they’ll have a few drinks and tell this story at a dinner party or whatever. Um… And it makes me feel crazy, because I’m like, “It cannot be true.” So, why are you doing this to me? What is this? Um, and my brother and I get really upset. I’ll tell you the story and then you can be the judge, if you think it’s true or not. Okay? [audience whoops] Okay. So, my parents swear that when they were in their late twenties, they were driving through Northern Ontario, down a winding road through a forest, and they drove under a moose. [crowd laughing] [scoffs] They swear. They swear. My mom says they were driving down this winding road, the moose was horizontal on the road, and they drove under its belly. It makes me feel insane. I’m like, “What are you talking about?” It’s… And so it’s… [laughs] She does a sound effect of the sound of the belly fur of the moose gently grazing the roof of the car. Just like… [whooshes softly] Can you imagine? It makes me feel insane. It makes me feel crazy. And, uh, it makes my brother irate, as well. Because… So, the last time I was visiting, me and my brother were like, “We need to get to the bottom of this.” We need to find out if this is even possible. So we did research and we found out the height of a Toyota Tercel. That’s the car they were driving. So, the height of the roof of the car. We Googled the largest ever recorded moose. And the infuriating thing is it could just have happened. It could just have happened. If they happened to stumble upon the biggest-ever recorded moose, I guess it’s possible. It makes me feel insane. [sighs] You think it’s true? Give a cheer if you think it’s true. [crowd cheering] Really? Give a cheer if you think it’s bullshit. [loud cheering] See? I don’t know. I think it says a lot about your worldview. Like, if you believe in the moose, you’re young at heart. You… You’ve retained a sliver of, like, childlike enthusiasm about life. And if you don’t believe in the moose, you’re… Look, it’s been a tough couple years. It’s been tough, hasn’t it? Oh my God. It really has. We got to do whatever it takes to get by. You know? Whatever makes you feel good. Like… So my father sent me a news article recently. Uh, he sent me this news article, and was like, “I thought you’d like this.” “I thought you’d relate to it.” Those are the words he used. “I thought you’d really relate to this.” This was the story, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it. I’m going to tell it to you. So this, it happened in the Netherlands, in a small town in the Netherlands, where basically this family noticed that they weren’t getting any mail. They were like, “We haven’t received any mail in a long time.” Weeks start going by. They’re like, “Wait. We’re not even getting our bills or pamphlets in the mail. This is really weird.” So they go to their neighbors. “Are you guys getting your mail?” They’re like, “No. This is so weird. Not for so long.” So they go to the post office and speak to, like, the boss. The mail boss, you know. [chuckling] You know, the mail boss… that you have to defeat to pass Level 10. [laughs] He’s like… [growls] And, um… They’re like, “We’re not getting any of our mail.” He’s like, “I’ll look into it.” He goes to speak to the mailman who’s responsible for that block. And I can’t remember the mailman’s name, so we’ll call him like… Gary. We’ll call him Gary. He’s like, “Gary, these people are saying that they’re not getting their mail.” “What’s going on?” And Gary’s like weirdly defensive right away. He’s like, “I don’t know what to tell you. I deliver the mail.” “If they’re not getting mail, it means no one’s writing to them.” They’re like, “Okay.” So the mail boss is like, “Okay, Gary.” But privately, to his coworkers, he’s like, “What’s up with Gary?” Gary is being really weird. So they decide they’re going to keep an eye on Gary and investigate the sitch. And so, the next day, Gary comes to work and first red flag, he picks up the mail and gets in his personal vehicle. Not the mail truck or whatever. Gets in his… And he drives out of town. So they’re like, “Fuck.” And they followed him. They follow him, and he drives into the forest in the Netherlands. And they follow him at a distance. They watch him park. They park. They’re keeping an eye on him. They see him get out of the car. He takes the bag of mail, he goes into the woods, he’s gone 45 minutes. He comes back out with no bag. Gets in his car, drives away. So they go in after him. Into the forest. And… Imagine this. This is the sight they’re confronted with, okay? Beautiful, dappled sunlight, you know. Mist rising from the moss. There’s a lone moose. A huge moose in the background. Just towering over the trees, truly. Um… [laughs] And they see, as far as the eye can see, there are hundreds of piles of freshly turned earth. Little… In neat rows stretching through the forest. And they dust, they brush the dirt up. Gary’s been burying the mail. He’s been burying the mail for ages. This has obviously been going on a long time and it’s now amped up. They’re like, “Fuck.” And, uh… They approach him the next day at work. Gently. They approach him gently. They’re like, “Hey, Gar. Um…” [clicks tongue] “I…” “We noticed you’ve been burying the mail.” “And we were just wondering, why are you doing that?” And in the news article, this was the direct quote from the mailman, in answer to the question, “Why are you burying the mail?” This is what he said. He said, “I did it once, it felt good.” “And now it’s just kind of what I do.” I love him. He’s my hero, I… Guys, Gary went to jail. He went to jail for eight months. Yeah. You can’t fuck with the mail, that’s a federal offense. Um… He went to jail. And I wanted to write him fan mail in jail, but I don’t want to stress him out. ‘Cause he’d be like, “I want to bury it. Argh!” [laughs] But, no, I really was, like… I’ve never felt so seen by',\n",
       "  ' my father. Um… That’s… [chuckles] It has been tough. Like, I’m trying to get back into life and sort of feel that enthusiasm again of pre-pandemic life. Especially, I’m struggling to feel that enthusiasm in my romantic life. I don’t know if anyone is in the same boat. [scattered cheers] But post-pandemic dating, like, I’m… ‘Cause I’m 35, like… In my early 20s, so romantic. Obsessed with finding “the one.” My parents are very in love and that was my model. So I just… Somebody would be, “Do you have the time?” And I’d be, “I love you as well.” Is that… “And I…” “And I want to go with you.” [awkward laugh] “Where are we going?” Um, and now I’m just a bit like… I don’t know. Last summer, I dated someone. A man, actually, a lovely man, if you can believe. Not if you… Wait, not if you… Not “if you can believe that men can be lovely.” Of course they can. But if you can believe that I… Um… Yeah, so we dated for like six months, me and this guy and, uh… You know it was really nice, but I’m 35, he’s 36. Like, at this point, we both have big exes in our past. You know what I mean? We’re never going to be that big ex for each other. Like, we’re never gonna properly traumatize each other, so it’s kind of like… What’s the point? Um… [audience laughter] And… [laughs] So, we were in bed one night, and we were just chatting, we were having a nice light-hearted chat. He wasn’t trying to be heavy. He just goes, “If we had kids one day, what would we name our kids?” I was, like, “I don’t…” I was like, “I don’t know.” At this point, I’ve had that conversation with so many people. I was like… [sighs] “I don’t know.” “Let me just wade through this graveyard of dead hypothetical children to try to get to the new hypothetical kids.” I’m passing the ghosts of ’em. I’m like, “Oh, look!” “There’s Olive and Basil, the twins.” [laughs] They’re there. They’re like, “You forgot about us.” I’m like, “Oh, fuck off.” There’s little Clementine, I sent her to a private school. You know? She’s got a clarinet through her head. [in child’s voice] “Come and play with me.” [regular voice] I’m like, “No.” [chuckling] And I finally find the new hypothetical children, I’m like, “I have no creative energy left to name these children.” Like, “Can we just call them both Ian?” I don’t know. Did you guys know that…? This is true. In 2018, there were no new Ian’s born. There were no… It’s a true story. In 2018, not a single new Ian registered on this planet Earth. That is true. And if you’re watching this, and you hate the show, at least take that with you. You know? Wait, so do you guys know what I mean when I say big ex? Like, you have your exes. [scattered cheering] Okay. Really? You’re like, “Yes, we know.” Like you have your normal exes and then you have, like, your big exes. Where you reach a certain page in the novel of your life… No. Uh, I do feel you reach a certain age and you just have to accept that for the rest of your life there’s certain names, where every time you hear them, all of your organs are gonna dissolve. And just fall out of your vagina. Or your bum hole, if you don’t… And you have to carry around a plastic bag just in case you have to collect your… [laughs] It’s disgusting. Um… So, I have a couple of significant big exes, but I have this one who… I want to tell you this story. So basically, this ex, it was a really intense relationship, it was like four years. And it was a secret relationship because it was her first non-heterosexual relationship. She was like, “We can’t tell anyone.” And we lived together. It was so stressful. And she broke up with me, which is not allowed. Um… Which… I thought I had made that clear. [chuckles] Um… It was a long, drawn-out break-up. Anyway, so at the point where this story takes place, I hadn’t seen her in a year and a half or had any contact. I was in London and I was doing a show, and I was feeling good that night. You know what I mean? Like, I had a fresh haircut. I was freshly shorn. You know the feeling? I was wearing a crisp black T-shirt and… [laughs] Crisper than this. I’m sorry about this. This is… crumpled. Crumplestiltskin over here. [laughing] Do you remember Rumpelstiltskin? [crowd cheering] What happened to him? He used to be everywhere. We used to always talk about him. When you’re a kid, Rumpelstiltskin this, Rumpelstiltskin… Now you never hear about him. I get it. It’s hard to stay relevant. You know? He’s, like, faded into obscurity. Anyway, so I’m feeling good on this particular night, feeling crisp. Feeling shorn, and, uh… And also my best friend Joe was with me that night. He was in the audience of my show. I love having Joe in the audience, he’s a generous laugher. He’s a real angel, like, my best, best friend. And, um, I do the show, it goes well. And I go to the green room afterwards. Out the green room door to meet Joe. And I’m… It was a good show. I’m like, “Hey, man. Fun show.” But he’s like green. Just all the color has left his face, and he just goes, “She’s here.” And I’m like, “Fuck.” I know exactly who he means right away, so I’m like, “Okay.” And he goes, “Look, she’s upstairs.” “She doesn’t know you’re in the building. She came to the bar to have a drink with some of our mutual friends.” He goes, “Let’s just sneak out the back.” “Let’s have a fun night. We’ll go to a different bar.” And I thought about it. And then I thought, “No.” “I don’t want to have a fun night.” So, I’m like, “No, we’ll go upstairs.” We go up, I’m feeling confident. I see, there she is with our mutual friends and, um… You guys would have been very proud of me. I walk over very cool. [laughs] What does that mean? I walk over… Uh… Um… No, I walk over feeling confident. And… I’m also… I have the element of surprise. She doesn’t know I’m in the building. I think this is gonna work in my favor. So I walk over, go, “Hey.” Our mutual friends, they all know how bad the breakup was by this p',\n",
       "  \"oint, so they see me coming. I go, “Hey, how’s it going?” She’s like, “Oh my God, hi.” She stands up. We hug. It’s really nice. I go, “Great to see you.” “Hey, I heard you got that part, that’s so great.” She’s like, “Yeah. Congrats on stuff.” And I’m like, “Yeah, great.” It’s going well, and I suddenly think, “You know what, I need to be the one to end this interaction.” Right? I need to retain control of the situation. Like, I need to… We talked for a while, and I go, “Listen, so good to see you…” She goes, “You want to sit down?” I’m, “No, no, I’m gonna hang with my friends at the bar, but it’s really nice to see you.” We hug again, she sits down. I’m walking to the bar and she’s still kinda casting glances over her shoulder as I walk to the bar. And, as I’m walking to the bar, I suddenly realize, “What friends at the bar?” There are no friends at the bar. Joe has sat down at her table. He’s a snake. He’s dead to me. I’m panicking ’cause she’s still kinda looking. And I’m walking to the bar. Thank God, at the last second, I see three girls who were in my show. They were in the front row of my show. So I’m approaching the bar, thank God, one of them goes, “Hey, great show tonight.” So I think… I think probably what she wanted out of that interaction, like, what she expected from that interaction, was kind of like, “Hey. Great show tonight.” “Oh, cheers, thanks for coming.” What she got was so intense. I was like, “Hi, how are you? What are all of your names and jobs?” So tactile as well. Weirdly tactile. Like my arm around all their shoulders, like my head on their shoulder. I’m like… Mm! [laughs] They’re like, “Whoa, okay. Uh…” We’re chatting. Then, thank God, we start chatting, it’s going well, we’re getting along. So I’m like, “Crisis averted.” They’re like, “You want a drink?” I’m like, “Yeah.” We’re having a drink and I suddenly feel a tap on my shoulder, and I look around and it’s my big ex. This time she has the element of surprise, because I wasn’t expecting it. She goes, “Hey, sorry to interrupt, I want to say bye, I’m leaving now.” I’m like, “Yeah, yeah.” And we hug. And she said something awful, like… Like… “I’m sure our paths will cross one day.” You know what I mean? Something like that, where all my organs dissolve. Get the plastic bag out. Oh God. Um… [laughs] And so we hug, and she’s leaving, she turns. She’s still kind of saying goodbye to some people here, and I turn back to my “friends,” and suddenly, like, I guess I just got overwhelmed. And the floodgates just open and I just start sobbing. So… No, my face like crumbles, my shoulders… I’m literally just like… [sobs] They’re like, “Oh my God, are you okay?” And I just go, “Laugh, laugh!” [sobs] “Laugh!” It was psychotic behavior. I’m literally like, “Fucking laugh. Ah!” [sobs] And they’re all like… “Ha-ha-ha-ha.” [laughs] [sighs] There’s no real punchline to that story, it’s just… a vignette, if you will. To illustrate the level of emotion I’m operating on. I mean… I have a lot of feelings. Do you guys have a lot of feelings? [crowd whooping, clapping] It’s exhausting, you know. I’m full to the absolute brim with feelings. I always visualize, um… like Campbell’s tomato soup. That it’s… You know what I mean? Campbell’s cream of tomato soup. And then I’m full to brim. Right to the top of my skull, just trying to keep it contained. Just trying to keep it from sloshing out of my orifices as I make my way through life. That’s how I feel about my feelings. All it takes is one person goes, “How are you?” And it’s like… fling! Like, it shoots out my ear. They’re like, “Oh God.” I’m like, “I’m sorry.” [sobbing] [sadly] “That’s not about you.” [chuckles] No, I’m all right. I got a therapist recently. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [crowd cheering] Yeah, you have to, guys. You do. Like… Well, if you’re gonna complain as much as I complain, unfortunately, you do have to get one. Um… Yeah. I feel like my friends were starting to be like, “You should pay someone to do what you expect of us.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” I found this therapist and he’s really smart and we Zoom. And he said something interesting where he said, “Remember, you are not the feeling.” “Sure you feel consumed by the feeling, but you are not the feeling.” He said, “Within you, and within everyone, there’s a very still, neutral, eternal self.” “And you experience the feelings, but you’re not consumed by them.” He said, “Rather than identifying so much with the feeling, like, ‘I’m anxious, I’m this.'” He said, “Don’t be consumed by the feeling.” “Just observe the feelings as they come, with curiosity.” Have you heard that before? Apparently that’s the… So I think you’re just supposed to be like, “Huh.” “I’m experiencing rage.” “How curious.” “How curious.” [laughs] I had a really, um, weird thing where, during the pandemic… I spent the whole pandemic in London. I was just in my apartment, in the rain, in London for… years. [laughs] And, uh, I noticed an unexpected feeling bubbling up where I was, “Why do I feel embarrassed?” Like, I would wake up feeling embarrassed. And I was spending a lot of time, obviously, in my apartment. in my living room, and in my bedroom, specifically. And I was like, “Wait, okay, maybe it’s this.” Okay, stay with me. Don’t you think it’s kind of embarrassing that we’re adults and we still have rooms? Okay, stay, wait. That we’re like, “This is my room. Hm.” “This is my room.” “Don’t go in my room.” [laughs] It’s embarrassing. “I have to clean my room.” And, like, please. I, of course, accept and understand that we need rooms. You need four walls within which to lay your weary head each night. But I think what I find so embarrassing about it is, like, the way we decorate our rooms to reflect our individuality. And we’re like, “I’m me.” Right? “I’m myself in my room.” It’s so embarrassing. “I have one Himalayan salt lamp.” “Yes I do, and I’m me.” “I have my pi\",\n",
       "  'cture on the wall and I…” When you finish reading a book, you never get rid of it. You’re like, “I put it on the shelf in my…” “That is my personality on display for all to see.” [chuckles] “No one else is me.” And then I was thinking… Okay, this is a little abstract, but don’t you think, in a way, our brains and our minds are like our rooms, and we furnish our minds with experiences that we collect to then build what we think of as our identity and selves? And that’s all we’re doing. We’re little experience hunters, collecting these to put them on our brain shelves and be like, “I’m me.” And I always visualize every experience that we collect is like a little novelty snow globe. We’re just going around, being like, “One time I saw Antonio Banderas at the airport. Yes, I did.” “I’m myself. And no one else is me.” [laughs] And then all human interaction is, really… I really noticed this coming out of the pandemic. All interaction is just basically taking turns showing each other our snow globes. And being like, “I…” And just pathetically taking turns. And, like, someone will be showing you their snow globe, you know, and you’re trying to be a good listener. It’s a story about a party they went to five years ago. And you’re like, “Yes, and you are you as well.” Like, “Yes, exactly, yes.” “How wonderful to be yourself as well.” But the whole time, your eyes are darting to your own shelf. A hundred percent, the whole time… You’re like, “Mmm, yes. Well, no. Yes.” Waiting for your moment to be like, “And me as well. I have one…” [laughs] [crowd cheering] Thank you. This is so exciting. You know what? I was thinking… Well, I watch a lot of stand-up specials. Then my friend’s special came out recently, and they put out the trailer. I was like, “Fuck, it’s so dynamic.” Like, she’s so physical onstage and doing… I was like, “I don’t really move much.” Like I’m very… Then I was like, “What if?” ‘Cause I really want my trailer to be dynamic. So, I was like, “What if I just…” I know in my head the things I want to see in my trailer. I just haven’t written the jokes that go with the movements. So I was like, “Maybe I just do the movements.” And then I put it in the trailer and it’s just, like… Just like this. That’s in the trailer, how good would that be? You’d be like, “I gotta watch that.” [crowd cheering] I should just have, like, a hundred trained dogs. They all come out on the stage like this. And they’re all on their hind legs jumping and then we just have it in the trailer and never in the show. [laughs] Um… Yeah, feelings. I got a lot of feelings. So… rage, embarrassment. These are some of the feelings. Um… Another feeling that I… It’s very dominant in my life, and I think a lot of people relate to this, it’s, like, nostalgia. I’m very nostalgic. You know? And I know that’s kind of a useless emotion, like I’m… I’m nostalgic for pre-pandemic times and we didn’t know how good we had it. I’m very nostalgic, really, for pre-puberty, if I’m being honest. That’s where it all went wrong. Like… Yeah, and my friends are like, “Oh, yeah. You missed the ’90s.” That’s so original. “Do you miss how all of our parents used to have a lot of rubber bands?” Do you remember how everyone had rubber bands? You’d find them around drawer handles and shit. There’d be a whole ball of them. What were they for? I have no rubber bands now. “Do you miss how all parents had one big conch shell in the bathroom?” I’m like, “Yes. Yes, I do miss that.” Yeah. And I miss the easier access to abortion and less populism. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. [crowd cheering] I do feel, I think I’m someone who I never really got over puberty. Well, for a couple of reasons. I think puberty hit me like a ton of bricks, really. First of all, I’m exactly the demographic where, um, for me, puberty coincided almost exactly with the arrival of the Internet and the popularization of the Internet. I’m so lucky. I had, like, one to 13, kind of… It wasn’t around. And I remember the one computer in our classroom got the Internet. And overnight, the world just exploded, everything changed, it was like… We all got our first e-mail addresses. Mine was hot-mae-el@hotmail.com. [audience laughter] Thank you. Those were the days you could get the good email addresses. But it was like overnight the world went from being very manageable… Everything I needed to know was in just in one set of Encyclopedia Britannica’s in my parents’ basement. It was so relaxing. It was like a finite amount of facts. That was it. The nice, thin paper. You know what I mean? It was manageable. It wasn’t… Also, it was like objective truth. Like, no one was putting out the devil’s advocate set of encyclopedias. You know what I mean? Like, “Well…” “Are you sure Lima is the capital of Peru?” Um… [chuckles] And then overnight it was like… I was obsessed with it. I remember my friends at lunch being like, “We’re gonna go out and play at recess. Wanna come?” I’d be like, “No, there’s so much work to be done on the Internet.” “There’s so much going on.” I was like, “I have to copy and paste images of Buffy the Vampire Slayer into a Word document.” I then have to print that Word document. The paper will be sodden with ink. Just heavy with ink. Like… I have to cut those pictures out, and it’s going to be like cutting wet toilet paper. I then have to stick those pictures onto my homework diary. Like, I’m busy. I… I truly feel like I’ve been busy ever since. I’m exhausted. And another reason that I think puberty really hit me was, like… Okay, so, yeah. Regular puberty stuff, then the Internet arrives and the stuff that brings with it. And then for me, also, puberty triggered kind of a wild gender dysphoria and a gender thing. You know what I mean? [crowd] Yeah! [laughs] Uh-huh? Dead silence. Um… No, but really, like, before puberty, I felt like I was this bounding, androgynous child, very confident,',\n",
       "  ' did a lot of Ace Ventura impersonations. And then suddenly puberty hit and my body’s changing, I felt very like… And this was the ’90s too. This was the era of girl bands and boy bands, right? This was the very pop-fueled binary. And I went to an all-girls school, which I just, like… The ubiquitous question, the question you needed to know an answer to at my school was which Spice Girl are you? And it was like, there’s only five possible answers. You needed to know. You’d be in the hall, and a group of girls would corner you, “Which one are you?” ‘Cause they’re organizing lip-syncs and stuff. They need to know, no judgment. They did need to know where you fit into the constellation. It was like, “Which one are you?” And I was like, “Justin Timberlake. I don’t know.” “Nick Carter?” Um… I think, regardless, if you experience gender stuff, puberty anyway is a fucking nightmare. Like, you feel like an alien, and everything that was cool about you just becomes worthless overnight. Like, okay, I had this trick. Okay, well, it’s a noise that I can make with my hand. And I swear, it was really popular. People loved when I did it, it killed at parties. I’m going to do it for you now. Uh… Okay, maybe some of you remember this. Um, okay, this is the noise. [high-pitched vibrating vocalizing of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”] Do you remember that? Guys, I swear, it used to kill at parties. People would request it, they’d be like, “Do the noise.” I’d be like, “Okay.” I did it in a school assembly once. That was… That was too far, but, um… It was really cool, and then, all of a sudden puberty hit, suddenly I’m at a house party, I’m in a cupboard with a pimply 13-year-old boy who’s got a semi, and I’m like… [vocalizing “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”] And he’s like, “What the fuck?” He’s like, “I thought you were gonna give me a hand job.” I’m like, “No.” “I said… that I could do something cool with my hand.” [cheering] He leaves me alone in the cupboard. I’m there in the dark by myself, like… [vocalizing “Mad World”] Really mournful. [cheering] It’s hard to live at that age. It’s really… I mean… Don’t you think that the only way to flirt when you’re 13, the only acceptable way, is to go, “How big are your hands?” That’s… Don’t you think? Do you remember that? “How big are your hands?” I still kinda think that’s a great move to make physical contact with someone that you like. Except I was at my all-girls school, just sort of slightly getting it wrong. “Yeah, my hands are pretty massive.” “Yeah, yours are tiny, of course.” Going around the playground, being like, “Well, you know what they say.” “Big hands, massive labia.” [laughs] [exhales] But… So all that was going on, you know? And I think for everyone, at puberty, you do kind of… You develop critical thinking and suddenly, sort of, the hard facts of life are hitting you. I think if you’re, like, different in any way, like, if the dominant narrative that’s being told to you by everyone doesn’t match what you’re experiencing, know what I mean? Like, with gender, people being like, “There’s two. And you’re a woman and this is what it’s like.” And you’re like, “Okay.” But you’re experiencing something completely different. Then you kind of have two options. You can either question the validity of yourself and your experience or you can question the validity of everything else and the whole system. Once you start pulling that thread, you’re fucked. It’s like… Monogamy, you’re like… Can I bring two people to prom? Why not? I don’t get why not. And I really felt… And also, like… For me, I, um, I started doing comedy when I was 13 and I discovered… I got really into drugs, like psychedelic drugs. So that just exacerbated the general existential wave. Like I felt like I was peeling back the wallpaper on reality and I was seeing this very flimsy scaffolding holding everything up. I was just like, “What is going on?” You suddenly realize your parents are flawed, your teachers are, like, lonely or something. I remember being, “Mm, I think Ms. Buchanan’s lonely.” “I feel a huge amount of pressure to laugh at her jokes. And I don’t know.” Um… And yeah, I remember being really stressed by why don’t we, as a society, talk more about the fact that the movie Antz and the movie A Bug’s Life came out in the same year. Surely, powerful forces are at play here and we’re just not going to address it? Like what the… Um… Yeah. So, yeah, I was stressed and… And also, I think with drugs, it was a way to get out of my body. I was feeling very uncomfortable in my body and it was this trap door. And so I got heavily into drugs, and the bullet points are, I went from psychedelics into, like, the really bad ones. I got kicked out of my house. I dropped out of school. Fast-forward, I ended up in rehab. When I was 19, I went to a rehab day program for nine months. Uh… A rehab day program for teens, objectively, a bad idea. Well, in a way, right? Like, you get a group of teenagers together, all they have in common is they love doing drugs. Every day, at 3:00 p.m., the bell goes and they’re like, “Off you go with your new friends.” “Run along. Bond in the alleyways.” “The only way you know how.” [laughs] Um, but it was very eye-opening for me. It was a big turning point because I got into this program and there were 12 other kids in there. I was suddenly like, “Oh, fuck.” These kids have come from actually difficult lives, and difficult family situations. Like who am I? You know? I’m this privileged, middle-class kid. What am I rebelling against, really? But I needed to be there, and it was good. I wanted to fit in with all these kids. They’d been there a while, they were all really bonded. And they had nicknames for each other. I’ve never had a nickname and I wanted to be in on it. I was very excited because after like two months in the program, I came in one morning and one of the guys goes, “Yo, Bath ',\n",
       "  'Water, what’s up?” I was like, “Bath Water?” And they all start calling me Bath Water. Then the teacher starts calling me… It catches on. The teachers are, “Good morning, Bath Water.” I’m like, “What is happening?” But I get into it. I don’t want to admit that I don’t know why they’re calling me Bath Water. I’m like, “Yup. Not much. All good.” Yeah. And then finally, I get comfortable enough with them and we all get close. I’m like, “Guys, I’ve been meaning to ask you for months.” “Why do you call me, Bath Water?” And they said, “Oh, it’s because when you arrived, we all had a conversation and decided you look like the type of kid who would drink their own bath water.” It’s… so specific. So insulting. And creative, yes. Drink their own… I mean, look, I’ve drunk some bath water in my time. Sure. Haven’t we all? I mean, not like with… [glugs] [laughs] With a straw. Just… No, but, like, we all… We’ve all drunk some, haven’t we? Okay, wait. Do you remember bath time? Remember bath time? Did you ever, um, in bath time, take your wet flannel… Do you call it a flannel or a facecloth? Flannel? Yeah. Canada, yeah. [laughs] Did you ever take your wet flannel and lie it on your face, and breathe through it? And then you suddenly feel like you’re waterboarding yourself? You’re like, “Oh no, God!” Or did you ever suck the water out of your flannel? Right? It feels so squeaky on your… What a feeling. Bath time. You know what I mean? Know what I miss most? I’ll move on from bath time, but I will just quickly say what I miss most about bath time is just once a day, somebody going, “Uh, it’s bath time.” How good is that? I feel like we don’t appreciate it when we’re young, but imagine you’re on a shitty Tinder date, and the waiter comes over, they’re like, “I’m so sorry to interrupt. Um, it is bath time for you.” You’re like… You’d be out of there. [crowd cheering] Youth is wasted on the young. You know? Youth is wasted on the young. Um… Yeah, so that’s… Yeah. I think the reason that I obsess over my teens, and I’m constantly processing it, is that I feel like a completely different person now. And I did have this kind of chaotic adolescence, and it was really dark, like it was crazy. Now I feel truly like a completely different person. Like, I’m very risk averse now. You… Yeah. You should see me on an escalator, it’s insane. I hold so tight to the railing. I’m very like… [chuckles] As the thing’s approaching, “Oh my God.” I’m like, “One, two, three, go.” Waiting for my moment. [nervous laugh] If I’m not ready and it’s coming, I’m walking backwards. I’m going, “Okay…” “One, two…” [chuckling] Yeah. Yeah. But I do still… I feel different. I do, I guess, still get that self-destructive feeling. Like, that pressure building up. I feel like we all kind of sometimes have those impulses and you have to find the healthy way to deal with those feelings. Um, I do a lot of escape rooms. I’m always escaping a room. Constantly. Um… Like, I was on tour recently and touring is intense. Also, I tour by myself. I don’t usually have an opening act, or a tour manager, or whatever. I just travel by myself. I have these long days in these random cities in the UK. And I was doing a show in Edinburgh. I was Scotland, in Edinburgh, by myself for the day, and I was having the feeling of pressure building up. You know what I mean? And, like, I had just seen Trainspotting, so I was like, “We’re in the danger zone.” And, uh, I said, “What should I do?” So I go online and I found the Edinburgh dungeons were open. That’s kind of like the London dungeons, where it’s like this horror, immersive horror experience, where actors dress up like Victorians and scare you. And you walk through a maze of hell. So I was like, “Great.” Um… And I got the VIP package as well, which is just you pay 20 extra bucks and all it meant was, when I arrived, they take a picture of you in front of a green screen. And then they give you a key and they project a graveyard and give you the keychain of the… That was when I was like, “Oh. This is something you should do with friends.” [laughs] Friends or loved ones. I do now have a keychain that’s just… So, I go down and it’s me and this group of strangers and we’re going to go together as a group through this horror maze. It’s tourists and families, there’s like ten of us. We’re about to go through it, and this guy comes out, and he’s dressed like a kind of Victorian butcher. He’s covered in blood and he’s got a big butcher’s knife, big beard, Scottish guy, and he goes, “I’m the butcher!” I can’t do the accent very well. He’s like, “Welcome to the Edinburgh dungeons, we’re gonna fucking kill you.” And I’m like, “Yes!” “Yes, I’ve been praying for death!” Um… Then he goes, “But first, I do have a few safety announcements. Um…” “If you are pregnant or you do have epilepsy, don’t go in the dungeon.” Uh… I’m like, “Okay.” Then he said, “At no point will any of the actors in the dungeon touch you or grab you.” So I was like, “That’s good.” Right? Nobody wants to be grabbed in the dunge. So I was like, “Sweet.” Um… So we start going through and guys, it’s so scary. Like it’s just… I’m quaking with fear. I’m with these strangers going through. They do this thing where they love to turn off all the lights, pitch-black. And then when they come back on, there’s a woman standing an inch from your face and being like… [growls] It’s so scary, but I’m loving it. I’m like, “Ah.” There’s sort of a narrative arc where, at the very beginning, the butcher was like, “You’re gonna meet the legendary cannibal Sawney Bean.” Does anybody know Sawney Bean? Legendary cannibal, apparently, and… We’re like, “We don’t want to meet him. We’re frightened.” He’s like, “Oh no. He’s going to love you guys.” We know it’s building to something. And we get to this part where there’s a sort of boat underground, we’re in the bowels of Edinburgh, right? And there',\n",
       "  '’s a boat on a track and we all get in it. And we can hear Sawney Bean in the darkness, toward where we’re headed, going, “I’m Sawney Bean.” We’re like, “No!” The butcher goes, “Okay, guys, you’re on your own now. I’m leaving you.” We’re like “No, wait. We’ve learned to love you, we need you.” He’s like “Fuck you, guys” and he leaves. Now it’s me and my group and we’re in the little boat. The lights go off and it’s pitch-black. You can’t see your hand in front of your face, it’s so dark, and it’s damp and it’s cold. We can hear, “I’m Sawney Bean.” And I’m freaking out. Then I feel these hands on my back. Going up my back, and kind of coming around my neck. And I’m freaking out because I’m remembering they’re not allowed to touch you in the dunge. Right? I’m like, “What’s happening?” The lights come back, I spin round, and there’s just this middle-aged woman who’s part of our group. And she just goes… [spookily] “Ooh!” It was… insane. “Ooh-hoo-ooh.” And she was with her two teenaged daughters who are sitting on either side of her. They’re like, “Mom, what the fuck are you doing?” She’s like, “Ooh.” I think about her all the time. She’s like the mailman. She’s a hero, you know. A hero to us all. [laughs] But, yeah, I do things like that to, you know, to feel alive and, um… Yeah, I try to be very vigilant about my brain because I have a lot of shame about my teens. I behaved very badly. You know? I was very self-destructive and I… The weird thing is I was so angry, I was really angry. And, uh… The weird thing is since, like, 2016… I remember when Trump got elected. I was like, “So we can’t deny anymore that the world is slightly off its axis.” It’s a little fucked, right? We have so much information available to us now, it’s hard to deny the system doesn’t work for everyone. Like, billionaires don’t pay taxes and all the stuff we know. So I’m like, “Okay, in a way, my anger was valid.” I think a lot of teenagers feel this righteous indignation and stuff. But the method of my rebellion was garbage. Like, it was so self-destructive and self-involved. You know, it was impotent, ultimately. I got this tattoo when I was 16. It says, “Oatmeal.” Um… It says, “Oatmeal,” twice. I remember being like, “Fuck the man, you know.” Like, what? [chuckles] So that’s there for good. Uh… [scattered cheers] I… I remember feeling like… I felt like the world was a house that had been sold to me at a very young age when I was too young to be signing mortgages. A house that was sold to me by a really shady realtor. Like, a kind of greasy, with a… A doggy-style baby realtor. [grumbling] “Sign here, kid.” And I’m like, “Okay.” “All your dreams will come true.” I sign it, suddenly I’m in this house. You develop critical thinking. You wake up in the house in your teens. You’re like, “Wait.” Hang on, the foundations of the house are rotten, the backyard’s on fire ’cause the previous owners kept heating it with fossil fuels exclusively. So my reaction was, I thought, “All right, I’ll just bulldoze the house with myself in it.” And of course, now I realize what I should have done is put any amount of energy into fixing the house, right? That’s what we need to do is… That’s hopefully what we’re trying to do. We have to, right? Put some energy into making the house a nicer place to live. ‘Cause it won’t do it… Yeah. [crowd cheering] I do feel we have to consciously do it. Or else it won’t happen. You know? Um… And that’s why I am really… I love… I feel like Gen Z is incredible. I don’t believe that they’re just on TikTok. I think they’re wicked. They’re out there. They’re doing stuff. You know, protesting climate change and dismantling rigid gender binaries. What was I doing? I was slithering around being like, “Does anyone have any acid?” [laughs awkwardly] Just like useless behavior. And they’re wicked. I want to talk about… I want to talk about, like, the gender thing for a sec. So… [crowd cheering] Just because I’ve been in the UK, and now I’m in the States, and in both places there’s a real hysteria right now around gender and gender identity. And I think part of it comes from this misconception that it’s a recent Gen Z fad. Or a millennial fad, right? To have this fluidity around gender, it’s like… Of course… As long as there’s been human civilization, we know, right, there’s been variances in gender. There’s been different cultures that recognize third and fourth genders. Not just recognize, revere. Like I could have been revered. I could have been revered. It sucks. And instead I’m like, “Which bathroom am I allowed to use, please?” Um… And really it is a recent colonial fad to have this very rigid gender binary. It’s really like we just went around the world bulldozing over the nuances of all these beautiful things. Um… In the UK, where I’ve been living, I remember in 2018, India decriminalized homosexuality, and it was great. Like, big celebration, really exciting, but it was really frustrating ’cause the coverage of it on the news in the UK was so smug. It was like, “It’s about time, India.” And it’s like, England went into India and criminalized homosexuality in 1896. Like, it’s… It’s the ultimate gaslighting. It’s like lighting someone’s house on fire and being like, “It’s really awkward how long it’s taking out to put that out.” “It’s so embarrassing.” [crowd cheering] Yeah. Thanks. Um… Yeah. And the annoying thing is I don’t really want to talk about gender because it’s kind of lose-lose, right? Especially if it’s something that personally affects you and you care about then it’s hard to debate. You get emotional, you’ve already lost. ‘Cause you’re like… [frustrated whimpering] Like, it’s hard, but I feel like I should talk about it because everyone else is. Like, comedians. Big multimillionaire comedians, in their stand-up specials are, like, taking shots and punching down at a time when trans rights are so tenuous, a',\n",
       "  'nd slipping backwards, it’s just not… Yeah. And, uh… [applause] No, no, no. But I feel… You’re like, “Yeah, they’re slipping backwards, yeah.” No, just kidding. I’m suddenly like, “Oh, fuck.” [Mae laughs] The thing… And I watch those specials so I can be informed when I’m asked in every interview to talk about those guys’ specials. But, like, the thing that kept coming up was, “Gender’s a fact.” That was the refrain of one, “Gender’s a fact.” Then they cut to the audience. “Aw, yeah.” They’re loving it. And it’s like, um… I feel like I’m kind of preaching to the choir a little here, but just to quickly say… Of course, biological sex is real. It’s a thing. Within that, there’s tons of variation, it’s very much like… Scientifically, it’s not as binary as we think. There’s intersex people, there’s hormonal variation, all kinds of stuff. But, yeah, for sure, biological sex, no one denies is real, but gender is so much more ephemeral and much more what to do with what’s in here and in here. Very much like, you know, a social construct. And more fluid. And the way I explain it to people who are trying to understand the difference between biological sex and gender is I picture the gender spectrum. You know the movie Beauty and the Beast? Okay. So imagine if at one end of the gender spectrum, you have Gaston. You remember him? He’s like, “No one fights like…” Hot. He’s hot. He’s like extreme masculinity. On the other end of the spectrum you have Belle, who has Stockholm Syndrome. So dark, but, um… But, guys, she’s still an excellent role model because she can read. She loves a book. You got to hand it to her. Um… And then in the middle of the spectrum, you have the candlestick, right? You have Lumière. And I really relate to Lumière. I connect with Lumière. And obviously the more we empower Lumière, the more fun Gaston and Belle are gonna have. Lumière’s throwing parties. They’re like, “Be my guest!” Yeah. I have this fantasy. I have this fantasy that like… It’s a really clear image in my head of… You got Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais, Louis C.K. Throw Joe Rogan in there. And they’re eating a hog roast. In this fantasy, it’s a huge hog, and they’re ripping the flesh off it. [chomping sounds] They’re drinking goblets of mead. That medieval drink. They’re throwing their money. And then they turn the TV on and they see me doing my little Beauty and the Beast gender… Just like… “And the candlestick.” And they’re watching it, and are like, “Oh my God, we… Guys.” “We were wrong.” “Oh.” And then they just… [crowd cheering] That’s my fantasy. Then they just like… You know what I want? I want them to… I want them to cradle each other. I want them to hold each other gently, and just gently rock. I want them to re-parent themselves, basically. Just give a little… That. ‘Cause I do understand too. I get it. It’s hard to learn new language. You know? Although, is it? Like… Omicron, you know? We picked that up pretty fast. Um… But the… The joke I always hear, and this has been a joke… This was hack in the ’90s, this joke. It’s come back with a vengeance on the stand-up circuit. It’s like, “Well, like, I identify as a cactus.” Or, “I identify as a lamp post,” or this inanimate object. And it’s like… Um, yeah, I’m non-binary, which is under the banner of trans identity. In that like the sex I was assigned at birth doesn’t feel like it fit. [giggles awkwardly] Um… And, uh… But it’s like, I don’t want to necessarily identify as non-binary or trans, I just am that, I just am. And to say otherwise would be bizarre. It would be like doing a violence to myself. That’s what it would feel like. It would be like the hot tomato soup thing, times a hundred, just full of tomato soup. It’s tricky because it’s like… You just have to take my word for it that I know who I am. It’s so hard saying that to people. It’s like, I just… You just have to take my word for it. I am certain of it. And it’s like… I may not be certain if a Toyota Tercel can fit under a moose. Very unsure. But I do know this. Also, you don’t have to understand it even. You know what I mean? Like, I do not understand Wi-Fi. How does it work? What is it? But I know that it’s real. I know it exists among us. I just accept that it’s there, whatever. [crowd cheering] I don’t let it keep me up at night. I’m not like… Yeah. Um… Yeah, so I had top surgery last December and I’m on a low dose of testosterone for this past year. And it’s been the best year of my life. Genuinely. And I’m 35 years old. This has been the best year of my life. Yeah. [crowd cheering] Thanks. Um… And it’s like… What’s weird is, like, I’m not that happy. I’m not skipping around. It’s truly just the absence of agony. That’s all it is. And that’s a low bar, and who are we to deny anybody that? The absence of agony, yeah. That’s going to be my… [laughs] That’s going to be my album title. Um… Yeah, okay. And also, I’m really just so grateful to have the language now. Right? Growing up I didn’t have that language. But I always felt this way and I remember being… You know when you’re four or five and your parents tell the story of your birth? You know? And… I feel like my parents… It sounds like they were always talking about my conception and my birth. I swear we had normal conversations as well. But I remember my dad telling me, “Your mother went into labor, we went to the hospital.” He was saying, “Maybe you’ll have your own kids one day.” And I’m imagining having my own kids. In my fantasy of having children, I was never the one having the kids. It was a really specific fantasy where I was this 1950s businessman father, just like pacing the halls of the hospital. Smoking. Just… Really like a very 101 Dalmatians vibe. Then some nurse would be like, “It’s a boy.” And I’d be like, “Cheers, gentlemen.” “I’ll name it Buster.” “Send it down the mines.” Um, yeah. Okay, we’re almost at the end. I have one more t',\n",
       "  'hing to tell you. I’m gonna get my mic stand. If I… Yeah, imagine if I lost it? So, I feel like… And by the way, thank you so much. This has been really… You’ve been amazing. [crowd cheering] I feel like we’ve been through, like… In terms of our worldview, we’ve been through pessimism and optimism. And I really want to end on a positive note. So I want to tell you this Buddhist parable that I love. Um, this is… Stay with me. So… I love this story. Um… And then I’m gonna go. It takes place in the forest, actually. We’re back in the forest. And, basically, in this parable, this man is being chased, pursued through the forest by what I can only describe as a beast from hell. Like, a really terrifying creature with a lion’s jaws and this monstrous body. Its nature is pure hunger. It wants to devour this man, and it’s been chasing him for days, and he’s been running. And he’s starting to get exhausted. At some point, he’s going to succumb to the beast. Just when he thinks he’s gonna pass out and the beast is gonna get him, he sees this little stone well in the middle of the forest, little circular well. He’s like, “I’ll hide in the well from the beast.” He jumps in. Sure enough, the beast doesn’t follow him It stops at the top and is like… [growls] He’s like, “Great.” He’s falling down the well, and as he’s falling, he feels water splashing up onto his feet. He’s like, “That’s weird.” And he looks down. And below him, where he’s headed, the water is churning wildly, and he realizes… What’s at the bottom of the well? Another beast. Yeah. It’s a double beast situash. Bad. Bad news. Beast at the top, beast below. [growls] Like that. And, at the last second, he sees this branch growing out of the side of the well, like a gnarly branch. So he grabs onto it and he uses his last remaining strength to maneuver himself up onto this branch. And his muscles are quivering. But he’s like, “I made it.” The beast is there, the beast below. And the branch is creaking under his weight, like, this is not a permanent solution. Right? At some point, the branch is going to give out. And he’s sweating… he’s sweating in that crease here. You know? If you’re sweating in that crease, you are in trouble. And suddenly he looks to the end of the branch and he sees something glistening on the end. He’s like, “What is that?” And so he balances and he reaches out with one finger to the end of the branch, and he gets it on his finger. It’s golden, glistening tree sap. It’s tree sap. And he puts it in his mouth and he’s like, “Is that? That’s delicious.” Guys, it’s positive. Wait. That’s… That’s it. No. Hello? [laughs] Okay. Okay. Uh… Trust me, I find it very positive. You got to get on board. Please. I’ve called the show SAP. You truly must get on board. Like, this was not cheap. [crowd cheering] No, but I really do find it positive because it’s, like, look. Life might be a double beast situash. That might be just what life… In a way, is it not? Know what I mean? But luckily there’s so much sap, and we have to just to take the time, it’s worth it to enjoy the sap, and cultivate it where we can. And luckily there’s an abundance of sap, I think. Like everywhere you look, if you look hard. You got dogs. Every dog on this Earth. Like a good pair of jeans. That’s sap. That can be sap. The Beatles, for me, are sap. Um… Your friends. The TV show Friends. No, like having friends. Um, sex is good. Sex with your friends is pretty good. Um… Scaring people, “Ooh.” Yeah, if that’s… I like campfires, roasting marshmallows, the song “Bennie and the Jets” by Elton John. Um… Yeah, hugs and sparklers, Christmas lights, all those things are fully sap. All those things can be sap. And genuinely, this may be corny, but truly, this is sap for me. Doing this makes me so happy and it’s sap for me. And I’m so grateful to you all for coming. [crowd cheering] Thank you so much. [continue cheering] [continue cheering] [man clapping] Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Oh, fuck. [sniffles] [sobbing] Oh my God. Oh my God. Are… Wait. Are you crying? Yeah, I mean, it was all just so sad. [sobbing] It was supposed to be funny. No, it wasn’t. Yeah, it was. The whole thing. Really? [sighs] Guess you and I just have different senses of humor. Well, thank you for listening anyway. [sniffs] It’s good to get that stuff off my chest. No, it’s… It’s me. I’m me. You are you. It’s wonderful. Well, should we get started? Yeah.

This self-produced show reflects Rife’s intimate connection with his audience, evidenced by his first YouTube-released special, “Only Fans.” Rife’s humor traverses a wide range of topics, including his personal life, societal observations, and playful yet edgy commentary on relationships, identity, and sexuality. A recurring theme is his humorous appreciation for gay men, along with a tongue-in-cheek lament about his straight identity. He shares anecdotes about his family, notably a comically risqué story involving his grandfather and unconventional Christmas gifts, which elicits both shock and laughter from the audience. Rife doesn’t shy away from addressing potentially contentious issues like dating, red flags in relationships, and the intricacies of navigating modern sexual dynamics. His commentary extends to broader societal topics, including political correctness, cancel culture, and the complexities of identity politics, all delivered with his characteristic irreverence. Rife balances his edgier material with self-awareness and a clear intention not to cause harm, instead aiming to find humor in life’s absurdities.

Let’s see who gets offended. [Music] [Applause] Thank you! Oh, my God, Austin, what the fuck is up? How is everybody? Good? Let’s go! Oh, my God, thank you guys so much for coming out. This is so cool. It means the absolute world. Thank you, guys. Ah, just checking you all out. This is fun. This is good. Gay? One for one, baby. Let’s go, let’s go! Oh, it’s the energy I was looking for. Thank goodness, man. Oh, my God, thank you so much for coming out twice. I appreciate that. It’s very brave, very great. I’ll be honest with you, I wish my entire crowd was gay, man, to be honest. It’s just an energy you want to be around, you know what I mean? I’ve never met a gay dude in a bad mood, not once. I’ve been so jealous of gay men lately. You have no idea. That’s what I’m talking about, man. I’ve been so jealous, man. It looks like a good time going on over there. I wish I was gay, for the fitness or the fashion alone. Are you kidding me? Oh, my God, I’m straight, but I’d love to be in gay shape, you know what I mean? You ever meet a gay dude? They’re in great shape, every fucking time, man. It’s so impressive. Gay dudes stay in the gym. That’s the guy’s name, Jim. They just stay in there. They’re just turning it out, burning calories, dog. It’s dedication. You better respect it. That’s next-level fitness, bro. That’s that level of in shape, like, you could fight off another grown man if you wanted to. You know, that’s up to you. You put in the work. Top or bottom, that’s you, dog. That’s your prerogative. God, if they’re not fucking shredded, they fucking dress impeccably. You guys look fantastic. Oh, my God. I don’t know if you guys know this, but gay men have a stranglehold on the fashion game. They are killing shit bro. Nobody in this world dresses better than gay men. You better respect it. It’s pretty impressive. I mean, you spend enough time in the closet, you’re bound to find something, you know. He goes… boots! Love it. Oh, man. Exhausted, man. We’ve been traveling a lot this year. It’s been very exciting. It’s one of the most fun parts about the job. Obviously, it’s a little taxing as well. I got a chance to go home recently. I’m originally from Ohio. I don’t know if anybody’s ever made that mistake. I never go home. I left 10 years ago, after high school, and that’s about it, man. I go home maybe once or twice a year. I’ll go home for Christmas or something like that, you know. I’ll go home for the holidays. I don’t mind that as much because whenever I go home for Christmas, I stay with my grandpa, and I love my grandpa to death. He’s probably the closest person to me in my family. And I love staying with him because whenever I’m not there, he lives by himself. My grandpa has lived alone for like 15 years. It’s been single 15 years. Hasn’t been on a date in 15 years. As you can imagine, carpal tunnel is on its way. And because he’s lived alone for so long, he’s kind of become this crotchety, grumpy old man. He doesn’t like anything or anybody. He complains all day long. You all know',\n",
       "  ' an old person like this. He’s always the hardest person to shop for, for Christmas, every year. So, two years ago, it’s mid-December, right? I’m at my place in L.A., I’m getting ready to go home, you know, finishing up all my online shopping. And it gets down to him. Every year, I’m sitting there, just racking my brain, I’m like, “What the fuck do I get this dude?” He doesn’t like anything. He doesn’t like anybody. He doesn’t have anybody. So, I bought him a pocket pussy. Normally, I would be like, “Does anybody not know what a pocket pussy is?” But this is Sixth Street; y’all be fucking banana peels, whatever y’all can find out here. Y’all in no position to judge my family, okay? Bro, I just wish y’all could have been there to see him open it on Christmas morning because we all thought he was gonna be like, “What the fuck is this shit?” He was like, “Thank you.” This is exactly what I needed.” I was like, “It’s a flashlight, not a Purple Heart, dog. Relax, okay? Stop feeling so honored.” He loved it, man. So obviously, Christmas is a good time. And then we fast forward a little bit. Now, we fast forward to that following February, and I hadn’t spoken to my grandpa since Christmas. So, I call him up. “Steve, Stephen, what’s up, man? How you doing? I love you. I miss you. My Christmas was fun. It’s always good to spend the holidays with you, you know. How was it?” And there was just a silence on his end of the phone. I was like, “Are you using it right now? Like, fucking answer me, dog. Like, what’s the review, you know? I’m interested.” He gets all defensive, and I’ll never forget these words for as long as I live. He goes, “No, no, no, no, no. I, uh, I broke her neck.” There is so much to unpack in that one sentence. First of all, “her”? You gave it a pronoun; now it’s real. Second, “neck”? That’s not even what it is. And third, you broke it, dog? How hard are you going? Fucking 15 years, you forget how to be a gentleman? So, we laughed on the phone for a couple of hours, and then now we fast forward to the following Christmas. This is last Christmas. Again, same time of year, going home, finishing up shopping, gets down to him. So now, I’m really struggling. I’m like, “What the fuck do I get this dude this year?” Like, how do I possibly top what I did last year, you know? Clearly, he enjoyed it, and now my man hasn’t had pussy since at least February. So, uh, I doubled down. Got him another one. I got him two pocket pussies, two Christmases in a row. I’m grandson of the decade, easily. Only, well, you know, obviously, I was a little bit more aware of what it was going to be put through this time around. I had to find it more and more durable, right? You know, something with a stronger neck. Now, I’m out here trying to find a pocket pussy with traps, trying to find my Papaw a trap queen for Christmas. And I– fuck… I couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for. I was so mad. And then, I think I found the next best thing. I found this other pocket pussy that I’ve never seen anything like it. It was remarkable. It came with– it was like so souped up, it came with all these, like attachments and pieces… It was like a Swiss Army pussy. It had a compass, a can opener, and it doubles as a canteen if you’re lost in the woods, I guess. But by far, the best attachment this thing came with was that, like, if you… if you… like, let’s say… you fucked this side of it, right? Like, this is the entrance. This side of it is a suction cup. The idea being, you can fucking put it on walls and shit, if you need to. I don’t know, switch positions, work your legs, you know, whatever it is, feel like you need it added to your repertoire, you know? And I got it for him, thinking like, “Yo, this is so creative.” You know, now my man’s got free roam in the house. You know, he’s not bed-bound, beating his dick like a pilgrim. He’s got options, you know what I mean? So, I was excited for him. But now, I’m fucking terrified to go home this Christmas, and there’s just gonna be chunks of drywall missing all around the house, waist level. “Doing a bit of remodeling, are we?” His house looks like a mid-demo project. Like, “Ah damn, Papaw, you literally fucked from the window to the wall.” [Applause] So, dick sucked down the hall. Oh, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve. He’s disgusting… but he’s funny, man. He’s very funny. I called him about a month ago, and I told him I was gonna start telling this story on stage because it’s 100% true. And I think the world should know that. And he’s got such a good sense of humor, man. He was joking with me back. He was like, “You keep telling people that story, I’m gonna leave it to you in my will.” Which I think would be fucking hilarious. I told him, “Yo, you should do that, because I’ll fucking, I’ll put your ashes in it, name it Ashley, and then I’ll fuck it. Just kind of keep it in the family, you know what I mean?” Just from generation to generation, just so he can meet his great-grandkids, you know. Just, guys, it’s called cremation, grow up, okay? Grow up. [Applause] It’s not your grandpa, and my grandpa’s funny, man. You guys would like him. You can judge them if you want to. At least he got somebody. It’s hard. It’s hard to find your person, isn’t it? Dating’s hard. It’s a very cliche topic. Every comedian talks about how hard dating is, but yeah, it’s a relatabl',\n",
       "  'e subject. Something everybody goes through. You know, it definitely gets harder depending on where you live. Like I said, I live in L.A. now. It’s the fucking worst, bro. There are no good people. Bunch of fucking heathens running around. Nobody’s going to heaven. Not one person. City of Angels? No angels. It’s depressing, man. It’s so depressing, getting let down every time. Like, I just expect it at this point. Every first date I go on, as soon as I sit down, I’m like, “Alright, bitch, what is it? Ask me what my sign is. I dare you. I’ll split this check so fucking fast. I swear to God. Oh, you’re a Pisces? Awesome. Yeah, charge it to her crystals. They were in the moon all night last night. Clearly, that should stop.” I’m so fucking tired of hearing about astrology. I swear to God. It’s all y’all care about. I’ve stopped sending dick pics and just started sending my star chart, to be honest. It’s getting me so much further. So much further. [Applause] I hate it so much, man. I have so many red flags now, bro, and no patience. That’s the main thing. It’s like, I’ve been let down so many times. Like now, if I see something that triggers a red flag in me, I’m gone. I’m not gonna wait around to be inevitably let down, you know what I mean? It’s a waste of time. And I’ve got so many red flags. So, there are some that I want to get off my chest, and I think maybe we’ll find some common ground. Maybe you’ll think I’m crazy, but I think it’s worth finding out. And we’ll start slow. We’ll ease our way into it. We’re gonna start with red flag number one. And just a disclaimer, this one is not going to be the funniest one, but I do think it’s going to resonate with the most amount of people here. Red flag number one is when she had… that… That [ __ ] is red flag number one. Girls who don’t drink enough water, that’s what it is. Red flag number one is when she has another guy in her life who is consistently trying to sleep with her, and she refuses to acknowledge this. This is good. It’s gonna cause a lot of fights in the car ride home. It’s my favorite one. You clapping, you had a… you had an argument recently… Like I said, this isn’t the funniest one, but every dude in here in a relationship right now knows the guy in his girl’s life that he’s like, “fuck that dude. I’ll kill him tomorrow.” It’s so obvious to us, right? As the boyfriend, that shit is clear as day. We can spot it from a mile away. Usually, at the beginning of the relationship, we’ll clock it. We’ll pull you aside. “Hey, babe, I know you hang out with so-and-so, and that’s fine. You’re a grown woman. You can do whatever you want. I’m not controlling or anything. But just so you know, that dude’s trying to fuck you.” And women will always have the exact same naive reaction. “Babe, come on. Are you serious? Him? You’re worried about him? He’s literally like my best friend. Like, he’s literally like a brother to me.” “Word? Oh, that’s your brother? Oh, I didn’t realize what kind of PornHub family tree you were associated with, but shut it down, okay? He’s not your friend. He’s not your brother. He wants to enter your body holes. End of story. Okay?” Ladies, you have to understand. The reason we are so passionate about bringing this to your attention is not because we think you’re stupid. It’s not because we don’t trust you. It’s that you’re being taken advantage of. You’re hanging out with somebody who’s lying about their intentions so they can weasel their way into your life. That’s not a real friend. That’s some shady shit to do. So, we’re just trying to point out something that’s happening under your nose, so hopefully, you can be aware of it and put a stop to it. I promise you, we are coming at it with good intentions. And you still want to get mad at us and act like we’re the crazy ones making this shit up. “Oh, that is so ridiculous. Why would a guy go through all that trouble and pretend to be my friend just to sleep with me?” Okay, I don’t know, but I’ve done it so many times. How do you think I got you, stupid? Come on. Oh, my God, knuckle buddy! No, nobody has been a better friend than me. Are you kidding me? That’s why dudes can spot the shit ’cause fucking game recognizes game, you know what I mean? He’ll do some shady shit and we’re like, “fucking, good move. That’s what shit I would have done. You know, fuck you, but respect.” He is not your friend, ladies. And if you really do treat him like your best friend, oh, that’s so much worse because if you treat him like your best friend, that means you’ve gone to him with all of your secrets, all of your problems. He knows everything you like, everything you don’t like. You’ve probably complained to him about everything your boyfriend does wrong. So now, this motherfucker has all the Infinity Stones to become the perfect guy for him. So, when you and your boyfriend finally break up, who do you go running to? Me. And I’ve been waiting for this moment, boy, weeks, months, maybe years. I’ve been waiting for this exact opportunity, bro. I’ve been putting in work, too. I’ve been sending you memes in the morning. I’ve been texting you, “How’s your day going?” I don’t give a fuck about your day. Are you stupid? It’s about my day. I care about my day. Come on, man. It’s about patience. All I’ve had to do is play it cool and stay in the game long enough, and wait for',\n",
       "  ' the day that you come banging on my door, crying your eyes out. And I just have to play stupid, like, “Whoa, whoa, wait, why are you crying? He says he doesn’t trust me? It’s crazy. Y’all broke up? Oh my God, I am so sorry. Oh, some dudes are so insecure. Oh my God.” He’s not your fucking friend. Stop falling for his shit, ladies, I’m trying to tell you. Oh my God! Shut up. [Applause] Now, I understand this is the part of the red flag that I’m sure a lot of the women in the audience are thinking, “Well, Matt, what about the reverse? How about when a guy has a girlfriend? What about that?” And I hear you. Look, ladies, you can be – look, a guy can have a girl that is just a friend. No, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. I’ll wait. You, as a girl, can be just a friend to a guy, but it means you’re ugly. I’m sorry, I know you don’t want to hear it, but you are just a homie with a ponytail. I don’t know what else to tell you, man. Men and women can be just friends, but one of y’all fucking busted. Okay? Somebody’s ugly. Or maybe both of you are ugly. In which case you should be fucking anyways. That’s why it’s called bumping uglies. Like I said, it’s not the funniest one, but you got some thinking to do. Red flag number two: She cannot have any distinct physical features. I’ll explain. Nobody feel targeted. And before you get mad at me, I’m not even the shallow one in this red flag, by the way. It’s my fucking friends, because all of my friends are Black, and they will roast you within an inch of your life if you have anything prominent about your face that stands out at all. They have cost me so many potential relationships. I was seeing this girl last summer. I thought maybe she was the one, man. She was fucking beautiful. She was smart, funny, didn’t know her dad. She was new to town. She had just moved to L.A. from Austin a couple of months before I met her. Like, very, very sweet, innocent girl, right? We were hanging out for a while. We went on a handful of dates, and everything was going great. Until, just a couple of dates in, I was hanging out with a bunch of my friends of mine who I hadn’t seen in a while. So, you know, we’re hanging out, catching up, and they’re grilling me about, you know, what’s going on, what’s new, you seeing anybody? And I was so proud and excited to be seeing this new girl. So, you know, I broke out her Instagram. I was like, “That’s her.” And my friends immediately were like, “Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Which is Black for, “I’m about to hurt your feelings, bro.” They roasted this poor girl for, like, 90 minutes. Did I laugh? Yeah, but fuck those dudes. I’m not gonna stop hanging out with her over it, you know? I didn’t. We kept hanging out. We went on a few more dates until our last date, man. We were at dinner, and she just laid it out there. She was like, “You know what, Matt? I’m having a really nice time with you, and I think it’s time we take this relationship to the next level. And we need to start incorporating our friends into our hangouts, you know? I need to meet your friends. You need to meet my friends. We’ll all hang out together, see if our friend groups get along, you know?” And I was like, “Uh, why? You know, why are you trying to rush things? You know, I’m having such a good time getting to know you.” She’s like, “No, it’s important that our friends get along.” And I was like, “No, I hear you. I just don’t… I don’t think it’s such a good idea.” And she started to get really upset. She was like, “And why not?” And I was like, “Because we have the same chin.” She was like, “What?” I was like, “You have like a cleft chin. Like how I have. It’s very strong. It’s a very masculine facial feature. And like, I think it’s cute, obviously, but not everybody does.” She was like, “What are you trying to say?” I was like, “My friends are going to roast you. They’re gonna make fun of the way you look. I’m sorry. It’s just how they are.” “Oh, that is so childish. Like, what are they gonna say? That I have like a butt chin? Ooh, so original. Like, I’ve heard it all before, babe.” “And I was like, ‘Nooo, you haven’t.’ I don’t know how many Black friends you have, but this is kind of what they do. Okay? Do you know that they call you the Texas Chinsaw Massacre? Did you know that?” That was just off the top. She was so offended. “Oh, that is so rude. Is that all they know about me, is what I look like?” I was like, “No, they know you just moved here from Texas to be a chinfluencer, they said?” And now I miss her, man… I know. She was my little Chinderella… So stupid. I appreciate you wearing your best shorts. I know it’s hot outside. Like, this is still an event, you know what I mean? He’s like, “I know, I’m going to a comedy show, but just in case there’s a trampoline.” Didn’t even try. You mowing the grass after this? God damn, man. Whatever, it’s not your night. You’re right. Pressure’s on me. Red flag number three. Yeah, there’s more. Red flag number three: A big red flag for me is if I don’t have anything in common, like hobby-wise, with somebody. Like, it’s such a necessary relationship trait to have. I think it’s so easy to be physically attracted to somebody, obviously. It’s everyone’s first instinct. But I think if you want longevity in a relationship, you have to have that extra layer of compatibility, right? You have to want to do thin',\n",
       "  'gs together. I think, like, a big red flag for me is if a girl doesn’t go to the gym. And that’s just because it’s a very big part of my life. I love going. I go every day. I’m a very big advocate of going to the gym and working out. And it’s so good for your health, not just your physical but your mental health as well. Get your endorphins going, get some of that stress relief out of you, you know. But I do acknowledge that it’s not for everybody. It’s intimidating for some people who don’t go every day, and I try to be cognizant of that and try to help out the best I can. Like, there may be some people in here right now, or maybe watching at home, that want to get started and just don’t know how to take that first step. And if there is anybody out there, I highly recommend the program I just started about six months ago that changed my life forever. And that program is where I only work out with Black dudes exclusively. Because Black dudes will push you to your limits, whether you want to or not. I started about six months ago, man. I was in the gym one day, I was having a bad day, I was stressed about something, I was angry about something. And I was like, “Man, fuck this. I’m gonna use this negative as a positive. I’m gonna use this aggression, I’m gonna put up some weight.” And I’ll say it was chest day, so I was like, “fuck it, I’m gonna hit a new max on the bench press.” So I go in there, put the lighter weights on first, get loosened up, get warm, you know, then you gotta put on the heavier stuff. And when you do that, you’re supposed to have a, um, a spotter, so you don’t die. And I didn’t know anybody in there at the time. Closest person to me was this Black dude next to me. So I walked over, I was like, “Hey man, would you mind spotting me for this set real quick?” And he was like, “Yeah, I got you.” I was like, “I feel like you do. Everything about your voice is safe. I feel like I can lift the world now. Okay, come on.” So we go over to the bench together. He gets behind the rack in the spot position. He’s ready. I lay down, and I’m trying to psych myself up, get in the zone, line up my hands, get a good grip. And finally, I just get it off the rack. I get one rep in. Oh! I get two reps in. I hit a third, my arms start shaking, and he can see this. So like any good spotter, he has some words of encouragement. I’m trying not to die, and this man just gets in my ear. “Do that shit! Do that shit! You ain’t nothing!” I was like, “I don’t know, man. I’m getting kind of tired.” He was like, “My people been tired.” I was like, “God damn, I’m sooorry.” It was only like 255, you had white guilt on top, that’s like 500 pounds, man. I was like, “Is this pre-workout or a history lesson? What are we doing, dog?” I racked that shit up. I was like, “I appreciate you, man. I was struggling at the end.” He was like, “You don’t know struggle.” Fuck man, can’t have anything. So, that’s my new routine. Whenever somebody’s like, “You look good, Matt. You on a diet?” I’m like, “Yeah, it’s called White Watchers. You should try it. It’s when black people watch white people struggle. You will sweat, I promise you.” This is one of the whitest crowds I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Bro, I’m uncomfortable. You know, there’s so… Is this a comedy show or a meeting? God Damn! Oh my gosh. I’m sorry. Um, we could try something different. This could be fun, or it could be a fucking nightmare, but I think we can have fun. Um, so the thing is, it’s like, I could do red flags for hours, right? And they can be funny. We could all laugh, have a guaranteed good time, but who wants to do that? So, and a lot of times, I don’t like to do a lot of red flags because it is very male to female, you know? It’s listing things that men don’t like about women, and I don’t want that to be unfair, one-sided, or sexist. So, to even it out, sometimes I am genuinely curious. Like, for the women in the audience, what might be some red flags for a guy if you go on a date with them? He says or does this, that makes you kind of be like, “Oh, I don’t know.” I’m gonna go balcony. I’m gonna go balcony. What is it? Is it a good one? Splitting the check? Okay, splitting the check. Um, on a first date? He asked in the beginning of the date? Towards the middle? Oh, you were boring. In the middle? “Can I get you anything?” “Yeah, two checks. Two checks would be alright. Yeah, yeah.” So, where did you say you were from? How recently was this? Five months ago? Okay, and you’re still upset… Um, so hold on, where did you go to eat? What is it? The Gin and Temple? What is that? [Applause] Rude. What kind of restaurant is that? Yeah, yeah, catfish and steak. [Music] It’s like a Roadhouse, an expensive Roadhouse. Okay, well, yeah, I mean, maybe did you like him until that moment? Did you like him? [Applause] I’m curious. Until he asked to split the check, were you like, “This is going good?” You were… Fuck. Did you sleep with him? Wow. Oh my God. He split you and the check in one night! [Applause] Oh my God. [Applause] Did he leave a big tip? That was an unnecessary detail. Would did you say? He was sweaty after? Yeah, my man was putting in work. That’s just… That’s good… I think. Well, I’m sorry you got half of a meal. All right, well, one for one. What’s another fun one? \\xa0Do you have a fun one? What is it? This is going to get c',\n",
       "  'ancelable. Let’s do it. So, you said it when he says he’s on hormone therapy, but he’s just fucking jacked. So, hormone therapy, what’s that supposed to do? Balance it out, basically? So, what he says, he has too much like natural testosterone. He doesn’t have enough. Okay. How long have you been seeing this man? 25 years. [Applause] What? Where’d you meet him? You met him when you were kids. So, he tells you he’s going on hormone therapy to get more testosterone, but you think he’s on steroids, you know? So, did you find them? Could you get me some? Thank you. I’m trying to get in gay shape, dog. Let’s go. I’m taking all the shortcuts. You did find some. Was it a needle or a pill? [Applause] She said she thinks he is in gay shape. The plot thickens. Oh my God, this is the bigger red flag now. He has his workout buddies. Do you have a picture of him? I want to see what his gaydar says about… Oh, God damn it. The phones are locked up. God damn, your phone isn’t a hormone blocker. God damn it. Okay, after the show, I want to see this. Yeah, that’s a valid red flag. You don’t want somebody who’s lying about an obvious appearance thing. Like, if you’re clearly on steroids, just open up, it’s fine. It’s fine to do it, if that’s the body you want and the life you want to live. You chicken fucking can do that. It’s fine, as long as you can still get your dick up, you’re fine. If you can’t, then it’s not okay. Stop what you’re doing immediately. Okay… Let’s unlock her phone. Can we unlock her phone? [Applause] Okay, okay, okay, okay. Bro, what if it’s just a picture of me? Oh my God, that’s it. That’s what you unlock them with, that fucking flying saucer. Can I see your phone? There we go, pass it over. Oh, this is great. This better be worth it. There we go, pass that back, there we go. I just gotta see a picture of this guy, and then I want to see what you think. I want to test this gaydar. Let’s go. Ah, damn bro. He had the traps that my grandpa’s pocket wishes it had. [Applause] Why is his neck so big? Oh my God, this looks so unsure. Okay, resident gay, what are we thinking? What are we thinking? What is it? The pose? He’s gay? Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Any excuse to drink, go ahead! [Applause] Let’s go. Whenever we out again an angel gets his wings. This is good, this is good, everybody knows that. Okay, two for two, good about to see. All right, that was good. We’re gonna do one more for an even three. I don’t know if you can top that, but what’s a more fun one? College baseball? Oh man, you’ve been fingered in a dorm for sure. Okay, good. Oh, okay, all righty, let’s dive into this. All right, all right. So, who went pro and didn’t take you with him? Who was it? [Applause] All right, what is it that you don’t like about college baseball players? The ego of playing a collegiate sport at a high level? You can’t be proud about that? The seventh pitcher on the team? I love how you’re clowning them for that, but Loki you fucked with the seventh pitcher on the scene… Your pussy is the ball pen, do you know that? Strike one. Is it just an ego thing? That’s the only thing you don’t like about it? Because he could just be proud to be playing a sport. I loved playing high school sports. I didn’t get to play at a college level, but I would have been very excited to. Oh, you never… You never fucked him? Damn, you couldn’t even fuck the seventh pitcher on the baseball team? Damn, strike two! Oh my gosh, where did you go to school? You didn’t go to school? You didn’t go to college? Strike three, bitch! [Applause] Oh my God, that could not have gone better. I could not have gone better. Oh my God. Have you tried Little League? For the Love of the Game. Come on, guys. Okay, well that was fun. It’s a fun portion. No more crowd work. Nobody else yell out anything. That chapter is done. That’s fun, that’s fun. I like doing that portion of the show because it’s like, obviously, I come out here, I list all these red flags and their standards that I’ve set for myself. But it’s nice to know where other people draw the line. You know, what are some other people’s red flags? Is it something that could apply to me? There’s a lot of self-reflecting that I think people need to do more often, especially when you’re single. If you’re single, use that time to do some self-reflection. Think about the kind of shit you like. I went through a horrible breakup at the beginning of this last year, and I thought it was such a low moment. I was like, this is such a lull in my life, nothing positive is going to come out of this. But I did some thinking, and it made me realize so much about myself, made me think about the standards I wanted to set. But it also made me think about how much I fucking hate being single. This shit is so trash. It’s so trash. People over-hype the fuck out of being single, don’t they? Especially the freedom aspect of it. As soon as you’re single again, all your friends are like, “Oh, you can go sleep with whoever you want.” No, you can’t. No, you couldn’t before. Why could you now all of a sudden? The factor of being single, to me, I don’t like. I don’t like sleeping with a bunch of different people anyways, because I don’t like… That’s not fun. [Applause] That’s not fun, man. I don’t… I don’t like inconsistent feedback. My ego can’t handle it, dog. I’m too fickle. Okay,',\n",
       "  ' I need to know where I stand sexually at all times. Okay, that’s the best part of any long-term relationship. If you’ve been together long enough, you probably have pretty good sexual chemistry. That’s why you stuck around. You like what they like, they like what you like, messes pretty well. The relationship that I ended earlier this year, that was the best part about it. We stayed together months after we should have, just because we had that sexual chemistry. It’s a hard spark to walk away from. It’s fun, makes you feel good about yourself, you know. I was getting my ego stroked daily. Like, how the fuck do you walk away from that? It’s so much fun. I knew with this girl, there was like a certain position I could put her in, and if I hit her with like the right move, just bow, then like, she couldn’t handle that. Like, it was too much dick for her. She was like, “Oh, my stomach.” And I’m like, “Shut up. It is not in your stomach with your shallow guts. Whatever.” I should call her. Don’t call the ex, don’t do it. Don’t fall for it because sexual chemistry will make you ignore all the other red flags, the… you should be paying attention to. Like my ex and I, we had great sexual chemistry, but our communication was… terrible. We could never talk anything out. If there was ever a point that I needed to get across to her, I would just have to like finger her in Morse code. The next day, my boys are like, “How’d the talk go?” I’m like, “It was terrible. This… just sat back and rolled her eyes at me the whole time.” Luckily, I can read lips. [Applause] Hate it. But you know, single again, back to the streets. Now I just gotta have sex with all these women I don’t want to do. I don’t want to do it. I’d rather be in a relationship personally, but somebody had fucking other plans. And I want y’all to think about that the next time you’re about to chastise a dude for being a fuck boy. Like, “Oh, you just a… boy, you out here sleeping with all these girls, you don’t even want to be in a relationship, you’re just a fuck boy.” Maybe he’s not a fuck boy, maybe he’s sad. Maybe behind every fuck boy is a man who once loved too much. Okay, or maybe that’s exactly what a fuck boy would say. TBD. But while I’m single, I’m trying to use this time to be self-reflective, work on myself, think about what are some of the red flags I bring to the table. Is there something I could be working on? And a major one, a major red flag for me that’s been brought to my attention that I didn’t realize was as big of a deal as it is, and it’s, you know, in relation to the climate we live in today, and that red flag is that apparently, I’m not very PC. I’m not very politically correct. So, I don’t know if that term made it down here yet or not. Y’all, y’all don’t seem to give a fuck. So, and when I say that, I just mean like, I’m not one of those people who tries so fucking hard to like prove how woke, what a good person I am, because that shit comes across as so disingenuous and corny to me. Like, you’re clearly pandering so hard. You can be a good person without it being your entire fucking personality, you know what I mean? So exhausting, man. As long as, as long as you know your heart’s in the right place, you’re doing the best that you can, you don’t need to prove yourself on Twitter every fucking day. And obviously, I’m referencing the extremes, these like woke internet warriors or whatever you want to call these fucking losers, who spend their whole life trying to cancel people on the internet. That shit pisses me off so much because they’re ruining, they’re ruining a good agenda. Cancel culture is not necessarily a bad thing. I get what they’re trying to do, is eradicate negativity in the world and get rid of some bad, toxic shit, and we do need that. But a lot of that gets lost in translation when they carry it out because they themselves are such bitches dog. Oh my God, bro. And that drives me insane because I’m, I’m on their side. I hate the same shit they hate. Off the top of my mind, I can think of, um, homophobia. Homophobia is a massive pet peeve of mine because it doesn’t fucking affect you, who somebody else loves has nothing to do with you. And oh, and it is always the ugliest fucking dude who’s the most homophobic, isn’t it? The most toothless motherfucker from Corpus Christi. [Applause] “I’m, I’m not with that gay shit.” They’re not with you either, bro. Have you met a gay guy? They’re handsome. They’re in good shape. They can fuck your girl so fast. Okay, be thankful they took a competitor off the board. I hate it so much, man. There’s such a pain in the ass. And as, as you can imagine, you all have the internet, it makes our job incredibly difficult. Nope, nobody’s allowed to joke about anything anymore. Everyone wants to complain about every joke ever told. That’s so frustrating because, I mean, no, you guys have been here the whole show, you know I have a pretty fucked up sense of humor. Like, I love dark shit. Like, the darker the better, to me. I love that so much. Keep that same energy. Like, I love fucked up stuff, but again, I’m okay making those jokes because I know my heart’s in the right place. And even though I acknowledge that that sense of humor isn’t for everybody, I’m okay with that because I don’t need to impress everybody. The same way you wouldn’t try to be friends ',\n",
       "  'with everybody, right? You’ll find your people as your life progresses. So, it’s like, yeah, I might get in trouble, or yeah, some people might not like the jokes that I tell, but I’m going to tell the jokes that I want to tell, and hopefully, my audience will gravitate towards that, and we can all get along and have a fucking cool friendship, you know. And it gets tricky sometimes. I’ll do jokes that a lot of people wouldn’t want to tell or don’t want to listen to. Sometimes, like, you know, sometimes I’ll do jokes about trans people because it’s funny sometimes. Not in a disrespectful way, it’s never disrespectful. I’m just making light of a situation so we can all laugh rather than be touchy and upset. That’s all it is. And this is what’s so funny: the energy in the room is exactly what I’m talking about. Subject matter is what triggers people. I haven’t even said the joke yet. All I’ve said was “trans people,” and everybody in here got a tigh asshole. Everybody, not you guys, but everybody else, everybody else tightened the fuck up. The special is presented by poppers. If you don’t know what poppers are, get you some gay friends. Change your life. [Applause] But that’s what I’m talking about. All I did was say a trigger word, and people are automatically already uncomfortable. You guys are worried about being canceled just being in the room. Like, it’s so funny to me because the jokes that I tell, they’re never disrespectful. They’re always with the utmost respect. It’s… I never want to hurt anybody’s feel… They’re just jokes, just to say some goofy shit make the world laugh, that’s all. And people will still come up after the show saying the same angry rant every time. Just fucking “You… you cannot make jokes about trans people. What they’re going through is so incomparable, and you can’t imagine how hard their life is, and the shit that they have to go through. Therefore, you cannot make jokes about trans people.” And I hear you, I hear you loud and clear. But… the point that you’re trying to make is, you’re saying I can’t make jokes about somebody because of how hard their life is. And you are making very valid points, that I don’t know how hard that life is. I imagine it is tremendously harder than my life. I can’t imagine how hard that is to go through, and I wish you the best of luck. But… at the same time, to retort that argument, you also don’t have the hardest life. You know who has life way harder than trans people, that we never talk about? People on wheelchairs. Think about it comparatively, people in wheelchairs have a much harder life. Do they complain about it? No. We gave them a couple of ramps and kept it pushing. We fucking… Look, somebody– some people are gonna think this is an insensitive comparison. I think it’s a step in the right direction personally. I think if we want to head towards trans equality, we fucking start with better parking, you know? It’s the least we could do. I don’t know where we’d put them, we can’t assign them anything. Just joking, just joking, okay, relax. Hey, look, if you let it be, this can be the most fun part of the show. Okay, if you just have fun for the next 15 minutes, we’re all gonna laugh at some things that we don’t think we’re allowed to laugh at. Oh, is it like a naughty thing if I laugh at a joke in a comedy show? Have fun. Okay, do not get sensitive now. Don’t fucking sit there and feel like you need to defend the wheelchair community. They can fucking stand up for themselves. Okay, God damn it, you guys. Stop being hesitant. Okay, look, people in wheelchairs come to comedy shows all the time. It is incredibly common. You know what? They are some of the best audience members you could ever ask for. They come, they laugh their asses off. And I’ll tell you the reason I believe that to be true. It’s because I think they’ve gotten themselves to this point of understanding and this positive mindset that no matter the hand you’ve been dealt in life, no matter how hard things might be for you, if you can learn to find the light in whatever dark situation you’re going through, and you can learn to laugh at the things that should make you miserable, including yourself sometimes, that’s how you fucking win life. And you are going to be a significantly happier person if you can learn to laugh in the face of adversity. I know this seems harsh, but I just have little to no respect for anybody who wakes up every day and makes the decision to live with a victim’s negative mentality of “oh, everything’s awful, everyone’s out to hurt my feelings.” Only because that’s not fair to you, that’s not fair to yourself. Your life is so short and so precious, you deserve to have the best fucking time you possibly can and laugh your way through life and be as happy as you can, no matter your circumstance or no matter what anybody fucking says about you. You deserve that. Have some fun. We’re only here for a second. Have some fun, man. And that’s why I chose the comparison that I did. A lot of people think it’s an insensitive comparison in the beginning, comparing those two groups. But it’s because of the positive message that I’m trying to put out there. And I want people to remember is that no matter what you’re going through, I would never negate that, but I want you to remember, if you think your life is hard, somebody has it worse',\n",
       "  '. Try to remember that. Be grateful, be happy, and enjoy your time, no matter what. And that’s what I love about this example, is because if you think about the life of somebody in a wheelchair, that’s fucking hard. It’s a daily obstacle to overcome to do anything, every day. And the fact that they can laugh their way through that, we should all be able to. That’s what I have so much respect for the wheelchair community. [Applause] Because regardless of what they’re going through, people in wheelchairs are never annoying about their situation, until they’re getting on the bus. I don’t know how many of y’all have been stuck behind a city bus sending somebody in a wheelchair on, but it is fucking excruciating. You’re behind, I’m trying to make that right turn, and they’re fucking… “Put this motherfucker on the bike rack and let’s go!” That is the only time I have ever lost my patience on a handicapped person, is when they’re fucking up traffic. Okay, other than that, they’re angels. Look, if you’re still upset about the comparison, feel free to think about it and tell me I’m wrong. Let’s say you did, let’s say you took somebody with no legs and a trans person and you put them in the same room, the same handicap accessible room. See who you think has the harder life. “I just, I feel like I’m trapped inside of another person’s body.” “So, you have four legs?” “You’re… you’re not listening. It’s not about that. It’s a… Sometimes my mental health will take such a toll that I could just… I could just jump off of my balcony.” “Jump? What’s that?” “You’re… you’re not hearing… People will call me the wrong pronouns.” “Someone called me ‘Chariot Tubman’ the other day. You think a pronoun’s the worst thing you can be called? Come on.” Audience: What about a trans person in a wheelchair? Oh, you mean transportation? [Laughter] Don’t test me, dog. [Laughter] Oh, shit. Look, this is… this is a hard joke to pull off. It’s like a prosthetic leg; you just gotta… No, no, it is. It is, obviously, you take two marginalized groups of people who are going through a tough time, and you think you can’t make jokes about that, but you can. The joke works if my point is inarguable, and I think it is. I think those examples speak for themselves. I guess I just can’t wait for the day that I’m doing this joke at a show, and there’s a trans person in the audience who gets so offended they walk out, and I’m just like, “Show off.” [Applause] Some of y’all are still on edge, and it’s very annoying. Okay, I’m gonna give it one last try. I’m gonna give it one last try to get you all on my side. This is my last attempt to get through to y’all. Okay, I was working on this joke when it was like brand new, about eight weeks ago, right? I was in Arizona, and it’s a new joke. I’m trying to figure it out, obviously a little tricky to navigate, obviously a teeter on a very fine line of offensive and funny, which is where you want your jokes, you know. Have some fun, push the boundaries, you know. So, I’m working on it, I’m trying to make it the best it can be, and I can see out of the corner of my eye, front row, left side of the stage, is a young woman in a wheelchair. And I’m in the middle of like the trans versus wheelchair material, and I can see out of my peripheral vision, she’s laughing her ass off. She’s slapping her knee. She can’t feel it, but she’s slapping her knee, like, this bitch is rolling, you know what I mean? She’s fucking Ah, you know how they’d be laughing. Ah, handicapped people laugh like they’re getting good head, just… Ah. She’s so obviously having a great time, right? So when the joke was over, it dawned on me that I had a very unique opportunity to get an inside perspective on this material. And in order for a joke like this to work, it has to be funnier than it is offensive. And again, I want it to be, I never want to hurt anybody’s feelings. It’s just jokes, man. That’s as simple as that to me. But I’m always open to conversations. When the joke was over, I asked her, I was like, “Out of curiosity, was anything I said in that joke offensive?” And still laughing, this woman says, “No, no, no, no, no, it was… it was so fucking funny. And I want to thank you for including me.” I had never realized that so many people were so uncomfortable around handicapped people that a lot of the times, they won’t even laugh about some of the same things they want to laugh about, and things that they think are hilarious. So getting that confirmation is what gave me all the confidence I needed to know that these jokes are okay to tell, and we are allowed to laugh at them. You know, her and I, we were on the same page the whole time. We both know that’s what you do to vegetables; you roast them. [Applause] Bro, if you didn’t laugh at that shit, I would never be your friend. Fuck you, dude Fuck you, bro. Then I fucked her, that’s the crazy thing. It was after this show. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I’m not saying it was me, but she wasn’t walking the next day. I’m just saying, I’m just saying. I was like, “Can you feel it in your stomach?” She was like, “I can’t feel anything.” I was like, “Yeah.” My name is Matt Rife. Thank you guys so much for coming out. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause] Excellent. Um, thank you. [Applause] Listen, listen for one second. Um, first and foremost, thank you all s',\n",
       "  'o much. This means the absolute world to me. And I know, I know we laughed a lot in the past hour, but if you wouldn’t mind, there is something important I would actually like to share with you guys. And it’s something I wanted to address about the special. It’s very important to me. It’s the name of the special, “Matthew Stephen Rife.” Uh, it’s my full name. If you guys buy the DVD, you can get my Social Security number too, but it’s my full name, obviously Matthew and Rife being my first and last name, and my middle name being Steven. And I’m named after my grandpa. [Applause] The same… Pocket pussy Grandpa. And just to clarify, yes, that story is one thousand percent true, zero embellishment. He was… he’s a fucking monster. But the reason we’ve decided to name this special, it was gonna be named something totally different, and I wanted to dedicate this special to my grandpa because just under two weeks ago, he passed away. Um, and the whole show, I mean, this whole special taping almost didn’t happen. I mean, he was my absolute best friend, and I love him and miss him so much. He wasn’t able to come to my first special taping last year. So, for this one, I was like scrambling. I was like, “Do I even want to do this? It doesn’t feel right to do a show without him.” So, I mean, we’ve scrambled together, we changed some of the set for it. It’s like, um, this right here is his hat that he wore every single day. There’s even a photo, it’s a black and white photo of like, he and I when I was a baby. I think, I mean clearly, we were on the set of one of his 70s pornos. And like I said, he, he wasn’t able to come to my first special taping last year because it was kind of the height of COVID and everything. He also hadn’t been on a plane in like 30 years. So, for this one, a couple of months ago, like four or five months ago, when we decided we were going to do this special, I really, really wanted to fly him out here. He was very excited too, because I wanted to kind of immortalize and, in front of everybody that was here, tell him just how much he meant to me and just thank him for every single thing that he did. [Applause] You guys really don’t understand. Um, I spent every weekend with him when I was a kid. Like, he’s the one that showed me, like, all these funny things. We would sit around, watch Adam Sandler movies, and stuff like that, you know? Very inappropriate movies for a job. Um, and he was very funny. Like, he’s definitely the reason I have a sense of humor. When I was starting out doing stand-up, when I was 15, um, how open mics work, a lot of the times, I started out at the local comedy club in Columbus, Ohio, called the Funny Bone. And they would have these open mics. And how those work a lot of times is they’re called bringer shows. So you’d have to bring five people in order for you to get stage time. I was 15, all my friends were in middle school, so obviously I couldn’t have anybody come. So my Grandpa would buy five tickets so that I could get stage time and do this silly thing because he thought I was so funny. [Applause] I really wish he was here to see all of you people here. And just to let you guys know, if I have ever made any of you laugh ever, it’s because of him. [Applause] That’s why, when we were going over the stage decoration for how we were going to do this stage, I wanted it kind of plain and rugged. Um, but then, obviously, I wanted him here at the show so bad, which is why we decided to leave a seat open for him on the stage, want to watch the show. And as heartbreaking as it is that he couldn’t come and be at the show himself, um, fortunately enough, Ashley could. [Applause] So, in the name of Steve, this one’s for you, Papaw. [Applause] Hey, everybody, thank you so, so much for tuning in to this special. This is our second self-produced special, and it means the absolute world to me that you guys tuned in in support of this. And for anybody who might want to show any additional support, we just added a bunch of new merch on my website at mattrifeofficial.com. We just added t-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, hats, bracelets that you can actually pay anything you want for. And all the money we are making for Merch is going towards the next Third self-produced special we’re putting out next year. And to top it off, we are going to auction off the star of the second special, not me, um, Ashley herself. And I have signed it for you. It’s from me. It’s from the show. It’s a little creepy, a little sexy, a little gross. My grandpa for sure possesses it. But so can you. So thank you so much again for tuning in. I hope you enjoyed it and see you at the next one.

       " ['It seems like… It seems like over the past couple of years, we’ve developed this amazing ability to get mad at anyone for any reason. Like, I saw otters in real life, which was very exciting for me. I love otters, big fan. So, I post about it on Instagram, ’cause that’s how you prove that life happens. And then this woman responds to me. She was like, “You know, I used to love otters too…” “…but then my husband told me that otters rape baby seals. I just thought you should know. Be better.” Okay. Uh, couple things. What’s going on with your marriage? How is that where you’re at conversationally? He wanted to ruin otters for you. He had to look up that fact. It’s true, by the way. But he had to look that up. That’s not something they’re just giving away on Planet Earth. He had to do a deep dive. Much like that otter did into the seal. No, don’t you start groaning already! But, also, she told me this ’cause she thought she knew me. She’s like, “I’m a fan of yours, and you’re a comedian, which must mean you’re a good person.” “So I know once you hear this fact about otters, you will change your tune. You’ll be on the right side of history. You definitely won’t use this in a bit.” “Otters rape baby seals. I thought you should know.” You don’t know me! Maybe that’s why I like otters. Maybe I think seals have been getting away with too much for too long. Also, whatever you do, you gotta stop saying “rape.” These are animals. No animals are asking for consent. What kind of weird, fairy tale animal sex happens in your head? How do you think your Labradoodle was made? Aww! Did you think a Lab just fell in love with a poodle? That they saw each other from across a field and thought, “Let’s make hypoallergenic puppies”? Some breeder was like, “A happy accident, love wins.” There are two ways you’re getting a Labradoodle. Either some dog breeder jerked off a Lab, and then shoved that jizz into a poodle, or it was puppy rape. You can choose whichever one makes you feel better about life, but it was definitely one of those two. This wasn’t Lady and the Tramp, this was two dogs, one cup. And for the otters, if you want to say rape, all right, how do you know? Did you talk to the seal? Did you get a statement? For all you know, the seal could have been up on a rock and been like, “Hey, otter, want to make a new animal?” And, yeah, an otter-seal hybrid? The cutest animal in the world? I will hold the seal down. And you only care ’cause seals are cute. If I was up here being like, “Otters rape rats,” you’d be like, “Good, ’bout time.” You don’t have to have a stance on everything. You can just like some things. It’s okay. You can find bad information about everything out there. You can look it up on your phone that was made by a child. And you can find bad information about every single thing out there, but you’ll make yourself miserable. You’re too woke, go back to sleep a little. It’s not like I was posting pictures of Kim Jong-un, being like, “He seems like a fun guy.” Which, if you only look at pictures of Kim Jong-un, he does seem like a fun guy. We can’t wait to hate people. We can’t wait to have them canceled, and because of that, we get mad before we get logical. Like, me liking otters could have very easily turned into, “Michelle Wolf loves rape.” And, sure, I have a fantasy, but I don’t love that I have it. Social media has made every opinion valuable, especially if it causes a controversy. Like, right now it’s tweets and Instagram, but before that it was blogs, and before that it was manifestos. I personally love manifestos because you know when someone writes one of them, they’re fucking crazy. And that’s all your tweets are. Your tweets are just teeny manifestos. And you know what blogs are, right? Blogs are a conversation no one wanted to have with you. Even when you were typing it, your computer was like, “I hope I die, I hate this.” We have such strong opinions, and we can’t just let them be opinions, we have to fight over who’s right and wrong. I’m fighting with my friends. Like, I have a friend, she’s really worried about immigrants coming in and taking our jobs, and I’m like, “Well, you’re a stay-at-home mo',\n",
       "  'm.” Ball’s sort of in your court on that one. I’m much more worried about Americans taking immigrant jobs. I got a massage from a Midwestern white lady. Felt like a cat was walking on my back for an hour. And not like an angry or a hungry cat, just a happy cat. Trying to find a place to sleep. Then, a couple weeks later, I got a massage from a Korean man, and he pressed into my back with the pressure that he had left his whole family behind. That’s a great massage! You need a massage from someone who’s been through something. You can’t get a massage from a woman named Meredith, where the worst thing that ever happened to her is the one time she got bangs. Plus, you don’t want a massage from someone who wants to give you a massage. You want a massage from someone who has to give you a massage. These are two very different people. Someone who wants– Someone who wants to touch your naked back for an hour? That’s a serial killer. Someone who has to give you a massage? Someone who’s like, “This fucking piece of shit… comes in here and says her neck is sore from sleeping wrong? I work 70 hours a day. I live three states away and I bike to work, and this piece of shit…” And the whole time you’re thinking, “This is a great massage.” Such strong opinions. This same friend, she’s one of those people– She doesn’t understand why some people can’t afford health care. Uh, she’s really rich and she’s not a good person. It is though, it’s really hard for a lot of people to afford health care. It’s particularly hard for women to get maternity care. And I do think part of the problem is that women, we’re still too cute about all the stuff that happens to our bodies. We gotta stop being cute. Like, when we have a baby, we say it’s a miracle. Stop it. These men hear “miracle,” and they’re like, “Yeah, so why do you need health care? It’s a miracle.” First of all, having a baby is not a miracle. A miracle is going to bed with one foot and then waking up with two feet. “Oh, it’s a miracle. I gotta go shoe shopping. Get some of those lefts.” Having a baby is not a miracle, it’s a natural disaster. And we need to describe it like one so we get the health care that we deserve. Like, when Florida gets hit with a hurricane, they send help because they show you how bad it is. They’re not like, “And then Florida was kissed with wind by God.” No, they send reporters, they show pictures, they get testimonials. That’s what we have to do after birth. Get a reporter in there, put ’em in one of those weird raincoats. Like, “I’m here in Martha’s vagina, and things are bleak. Roads and bridges are out. Man cannot survive. Debris is everywhere. I have Martha’s husband here, let’s see what he has to say.” “I mean, you try to prepare, and, uh…” “Well, it’s just… my home is gone.” Gotta stop being cute! Same thing with periods, too cute about those. “Periods,” that’s not even the right name for it. All the names for periods suck. “Period,” “time of the month,” “Aunt Flo.” They all suck. You know what we should call a period? A period should be called: “bloody tissue falling out of a hole.” If you went into work… and you were like, “Hey, I got bloody tissue falling out of a hole,” they’d be like, “Yeah, take the week.” I know, I talk about periods a lot, and I know, men, I know they’re gross. Women know they’re gross. We– We get it. There’s never a time we wake up and we’re like, “Oh, I’m so excited to clean up a crime scene.” It does make you wonder, though. Are there more women who murder? We’ve just been so good at getting out blood. A skill we learned at age 11. Like, “No one must know.” Yeah, I clean out my vagina once a month, I think I can clean up a body twice a year. Periods are gross. I know they’re gross, but I talk about them a lot because I want men to be more comfortable. But then, I was thinking how women, how we would act if men were the ones who got periods. And you know what? I don’t think we would be very nice. I think as soon as a man got his period, we’d be like, “Get in the shed, Kevin. Kevin, get in the shed. No, you’re very leaky. And when you’re in the house, you’re only on the linoleum. Don’t you– Don’t you dare go in my li',\n",
       "  'ving room. That is a new slip cover and you’re very leaky. You’re just like your father.” Of course, women, I also think we’d have to participate a lot more in male periods. You know? But you know, women, we would have to be the ones to remind men to change their tampons. You know we would. We’d have to be like, “When was the last time… you changed your tampon? Babe? Babe?” “Oh, it was, um… Oh… oh… three years ago. But I took it out, I flipped it around, and I put it back in, so…” “Oh, no, little buddy.” I think that’s probably what male tampons would be called: “little buddies.” And I do think they’d be more fun. I think men would have more fun with this. Like, all the strings would have little superheroes on the ends. One would just have, like, Spider-Man shooting up a web. Another one’s got Batman. It’s like, “When Batman’s face turns red, get him out of the cave.” I probably just upset some men. They were like, “I was on board with this whole male period thing, until you combined DC and Marvel. How are they supposed to be in the same box when they’re not even in the same universe?” But the more I think about men having periods, the more it feels like it fits society better. Like, you know how women, how, like, when we get our period, we get, like, a little bit emotional? Just a little. You probably don’t even notice. And if you dare say anything about it, we get really angry. You know, you’ll be like, “Is it–” You’re hiding behind a couch. “Is this– is this ’cause of your period?” And we’ll be, like, “No! I mean, a little, but no. These feelings are… justified!” I think that time would be very different if men got periods. I think we’d really look forward to it. We’d be like, “Are you about to get emotional? Yeah, let’s do this. Uh, where’d we leave off? Your dad, kindergarten, go.” We’d cancel plans all the time. We’d be like, “I’m so sorry, I can’t go to book club, my husband’s about to get his period, and we’re gonna cry together.” And, like, when we first get our periods, a lot of us are in school, and we’re really quiet about it. You know, we’ll whisper, we’ll be like… “Hey, does anyone have, like, a tampon, or, um, a sock, or… or, like, a really big Band-Aid?” Like, even when you get home, your mom will come talk to you about it, but she’s still quiet. You know, she’s like… “So you got your period? Do you have any questions?” “Yeah, do we still have to whisper here?” “Yeah, the cat’s in the house.” I think, uh, men would be quite loud about their periods. I think, first of all, regardless if it were true or not, every man would want you to know that he has a very heavy flow. “I have a heavy flow and an important job! You can ask anyone in college. They called me The Flowmeister.” I think dads– Dads would be so excited when their son got his period. You know, he’d be like, “My boy is a man. Come out here, son.” The son comes out of the bathroom, there’s blood on his legs, he’s like… “Yeah!” Takes it, wipes it under his eyes. “Rambo: First Blood!” The dad’s like, “Son, I don’t want to get too emotional about this because we both do have our periods… I’ve already synced up with my boy.” “I don’t want to get too emotional about this, but I did want to give you something. It’s a Captain America tampon.” It was my father’s. Just remember to flip it around before you…” Gross, gross, disgusting. I was thinking about it. Like, could you even– Could you even put a tampon back in after you took it out? You know, it’d be, like, all squishy. Ugh. Gross, I know. I think we’d be able to figure it out, though, you know? We seem to be able to do it with your semi-hard penises. Yeah, we didn’t have to go there, but here we are. Just really turned down that street and now we live here. It’s gross. The stuff that happens to women is gross. Periods, gross. Birth? That’s– That’s one of the reasons I’m not sure I want to have kids. Birth seems terrible. And I don’t care how many times you try to trick me with those adorable pictures of your new baby up against your chest. I know underneath that sheet is a car accident. Like, if an insurance guy came by, he’d be like, “No, it’s totaled.” “The best we can do here is a rent',\n",
       "  'al.” All of a sudden, the husband perks up. He’s like, “Well, what kind of rental are we talking about? Like, a mid-sized Japanese?” Birth is gross, but it’s crazy, ’cause, like, humans are the only animals that seem to have that much trouble giving birth. You ever watch other animals give birth? You can find it online. It’s not porn. Unless you want it to be. Anything’s porn if you masturbate to it. Just take that one home with you. I would give birth– I would give birth if we could give birth like giraffes. First of all, there’s a lady giraffe, she doesn’t even look pregnant, she looks great. She has, like, a summer body. Spots are in, she looks amazing. And then, all of a sudden, out of what I can only assume is her gaping vagina, a baby giraffe just falls six feet to the ground. The bitch doesn’t even bend her knees! She’s just like, “Life’s hard, learn it now!” There’s a crumpled, gooey giraffe at her feet. She doesn’t make a face, she doesn’t make a sound, she just walks away, and she’s like, “Are you coming? We’re late.” “Fix your wobbly legs or you’re gonna die.” Seems like a good mom. I don’t know– I don’t know if I want to have a baby, because I don’t think I’d be that responsible. Like, I would want to breastfeed, but only because I want to use breast milk the way a clown uses a flower with water in it. Like, always going up to people, like, “Hey, how are you? Pew, pew!” I’d try to get a job as a tollbooth operator. Like, “Sorry, E-ZPass is down, but keep the change.” I don’t know if I should have a baby because I don’t think childhood should be fun. I think childhood should be miserable so the rest of your life feels pretty okay. Like, think about it. We were all kids. We were kids and we believed in magic. And then a bunch of shit happened, and now we’re like, “When can we drink?” It, like, makes me jealous of those kids that are born in a basement to a kidnapped mom, because… I’m gonna justify, you guys gotta trust me. …because there’s no way the second half of that kid’s life isn’t better. He escapes, he’s like, “Yeah, I’m an accountant, I have a window. This is amazing.” “I know what day it is. And, like, of the week, not 8,942.” By the way, do you think those guys that have those basement prison families… What? I think about ’em a lot. I think– I think I’m like most women. I think about what I would do if I ever got kidnapped. But this is how competitive I am. I don’t think about how I would escape, I think about how I become the upstairs lady. Like, I try to tell jokes, I always put the lotion in the basket. And then one day he’s like, “Claire!” That’s not my name, it’s the name he gave me. “Claire, to the living room.” And I’m like… “Yeah!” I high-five all the other women on the way up. You know, but they’re in cages, so I only get their fingertips. They think I’m gonna save them, but I’m loyal. Anyway, I’ve thought about it… a tiny bit. But those guys that have those basement prison families, do you think they build the basement prison first? Like, do you think they’re part of the “if you build it” community? Or do you think they kidnap a lady, and then they’re like, “I am so sorry, I’m not prepared”? “Honestly, I can’t believe you got in the van. That was crazy, I wouldn’t have done that. I’m gonna have to run to Home Depot. Don’t go anywhere. Just kidding, you can’t, you’re chained to a radiator.” Yeah, that… That joke got dark. I think the whole point of that joke is, check your neighbor’s basement. Once a year, randomly, especially if he’s a nice guy. ‘Cause we all watch those murder documentaries. We all watch them, right before bed, for some reason. And they interview the neighbors, and the neighbors always say the same thing. The neighbors are always like, “Well, you know, I just can’t believe it. I’m shocked. Well, he was always such a nice guy.” Yeah, of course he’s nice. He’s doing the thing he loves. Not a lot of people get to follow their passions. If you’re ever talking to your neighbor and you’re like, “How’s it going?” and he’s like, “Every day is better than the last,” check his basement! Anyway, I’m not sure if I should have a baby. I do know I can have a baby, I can get ',\n",
       "  'pregnant. This is gonna be an abortion joke, put on your hats. A lot of people don’t think you should talk about your own abortion. I think it’s rude to talk about someone else’s. Plus, I’d rather talk about my abortion than hear about your gluten allergy. Anytime I’m at dinner with someone when they’re like, “I can’t have the rolls ’cause of the gluten,” I’m like, “So I walked into the office…” And that’s just the part about how I got pregnant. I like to start stories from the beginning. And a lot of people think that even if you’re allowed to get abortions, it should only be for a very few specific reasons. Well, I think you should be able to get an abortion for any reason you want. -Yeah. Like, you don’t want a baby. It’s not the right time for you. It’s not the right guy. You’re a redhead and he’s a redhead and you’re worried the baby’s gonna be translucent. And supporters, people even that support abortion, you know, they’re like, “But it is a big deal, you shouldn’t be cavalier about it, it is a big deal. You know, you should take your time making the decision. I mean, not too much time, but you should take your time.” It can be any deal you want it to be. It’s your abortion, it’s your deal. If it’s a big deal for you, it’s a big deal. If it’s not, it’s not. Both are correct. -Yeah. My abortion, not a big deal for me. I left work, I got an abortion, I drank half a LaCroix, and then I went back to work. Not a big deal. And I also think, a pretty good advertisement for LaCroix. “LaCroix, get right back to work after your abortion. Now in Totally Gone Tangerine.” And we don’t talk about abortion in a real way. We talk about it in a very legislative way, but not in a real way. So, I think a lot of women have a lot of apprehension surrounding it. You know, we talk about it so negatively that you feel like you should have this sense of shame after you get an abortion. Well, you can feel any way you want after you get an abortion. Get one, see how you feel. You know how my abortion made me feel? Very powerful. You know how people say you can’t play God? I walked out of there being like, “Move over Morgan Freeman, I am God!” And then I crossed the street very carefully. That was the perfect time for God to be like, “You’re not God, bitch, here’s a bus.” And a lot of people think, even if you support abortion, you’re a monster. Well, you know why I had to get an abortion? Why I had to get one? ‘Cause I’m a very nice person. I did one of the nicest things you can do. I said, “Sure! You can cum inside of me!” That is one of the nicest things you can do! Every man in here should be applauding me! I’m a good example. And, yes, that is how I talk during sex. “Sure, you can cum inside of me! Man, this is fun. Jeez Louise.” And guys are like, “With a voice like that, definitely get an abortion.” I’m like, “With a voice like this, I can’t believe you came. Careful around fire trucks.” Oh, you think this gets any less shrill when things are being poked inside of me? No, it does not! That one hurt my ears a little. I’m– Clearly, I’m a feminist, or at least I try to be a good feminist, but I found out recently that I’m not feminist enough for some feminists, which is so like them. You know, not the easiest group to please. And you know how sometimes it’s annoying to talk to some men about feminism, ’cause, they’re like, “Yeah, I don’t like feminists, they want all men to die.” And I’m like, “That’s not what we want.” And then I ran into these feminists that were like, “That is what we want.” Okay, this seems unsustainable. You know, just biologically. But also, what a stereotypical female thing to do. Women want other women to be perfect. And it’s crazy because I know you can settle. I’ve seen your husbands. It’s why I worry that women will never get ahead. We’re more than half the population. We could take over, but we’re our own worst enemy. We’re never good enough for one another, we’re always tearing each other down. Like, you can see, as soon as women started to organize, you could see some men get nervous. They were mostly younger men. They were like, “Women, they’re organizing.” But older men knew. Older men were l',\n",
       "  'ike, “Yeah, don’t worry, it’s gonna fall apart.” “No, believe me, my wife’s been in nine book clubs. We’re not even allowed to drive down a street of a lady she doesn’t like. Okay, that one might be because I fucked that lady, that’s maybe…” “But she did forgive me and not her, so…” Oh, too close to home? I try to be a good feminist. I get mad, though. I get mad at some of the stuff we’re fighting for, because we’re, um, wrong. One of the things that makes me really angry is when I hear other women say, “Well, women are just as physically strong as men.” Oh, no… we’re not. Man are stronger and faster than us. That’s just how it is, it’s biological. I’m not happy about it either. But I’m not gonna argue it ’cause I’m not an idiot. There’s probably some women in here right now that are, like, “No. Serena!” No, she’s not as good as the men. And before you get angry, I’m not saying she’s not amazing. She could beat you, the man who gets tired during missionary. But the best women in the world at tennis are not as good as the best men. That’s why they put the women together in general. It’s not ’cause they’re hoping they’ll scissor at the end. That also, for the record, is not why they put the men together either. There is– There’s no scissoring in tennis, and, boy, did I make a fool of myself. It just– It’s so frustrating for women to fight that we’re just as strong as men. First of all, because it’s not true. But, also, it has nothing to do with equality. The reason we haven’t had a female president isn’t because she couldn’t do enough push-ups. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but a lot of our presidents have been very weak. FDR wasn’t sitting with a blanket across his legs ’cause he was warming ’em up for squat thrusts. One of our presidents got stuck in a bathtub. Taft got stuck in a bathtub. How do we not talk about that every single day? How is there not a store called “Taft’s Baths, too big to get stuck in.” Equality is not about making men and women the same, it’s about valuing one another and making sure we’re all getting opportunities. Like, women, I think we’re very comfortable saying we’re better at some stuff than men are. And if we’re gonna say that, we have to let men say they’re better at some stuff than we are. We can’t steal it all. We’re not men. Like, let– Let men have stronger, that’s fine. We’re better at other things. Like, women, we’re better at being people. And this… this is how dumb men are. Men could learn to do the thing we’re good at. We are never gonna be as strong as them, but men could learn how to say, “Are you okay?” Women, we should just admit this has never been about equality. You don’t want to be equal, you want to be better than men! Admit it! You want to do to men what men did to us. You want to rule the world. You want to line the streets with tampons and fill the fountains with Chardonnay. You want to repeat what a man said in the meeting and have a boss go, “Good idea, Cheryl.” You want to hold power in your hands, and that’ll never happen because men will knock it away with their strong, strong arms. Just settle for equality, and maybe a place to breastfeed that isn’t a closet. ‘Cause we are. We’re getting really– We’re getting really mad at men these days. We’re blaming a lot on men. Especially white men. We’re really going after you guys pretty hard. And I’m not saying you don’t deserve it. You have been sneaky little devils. Tricksters, even. But I do think white women, it’s our turn to admit that we are also part of the problem. I know, it’s really uncomfortable. White women are like, “I did not come here for this.” Others are like, “Me? No, you can’t blame me! I didn’t do anything!” Yes. Exactly. We just sat there the whole time being like, “I mean, I guess. I don’t know.” Plus, some of the stuff white men did, I can’t even believe was their idea. Like, some of the stuff was too clever. Like, when we gave Native Americans blankets with smallpox, that was definitely a woman’s idea. That has “mean girl” written all over it. A man would have just been, like, “We’ll stab ’em and throw ’em in a river.” And then, a woman was like, “No, no. Let’s give ’em blankets. ‘Caus',\n",
       "  \"e then they’ll think we’re friends, and we’ll be like, ‘Bye!'” And the white women of my generation, we have completely abandoned white men. We blame everything on you. Even though you pay our rent, we blame everything on you. We’re like, “They did it! It was them! We couldn’t, our arms.” We are the exact opposite of ride-or-die. We are ride-and-flee-immediately. We’re all Rose from the Titanic. We grabbed a door and we shoved a white man into the sea. “Like, I am literally freezing.” I should say, I do like to do all my historical women as millennials. Like, it’s just more fun to do history that way. Like, all the women on the Titanic would have been like, “It’s so annoying the boat sunk.” “Like, how do you not see an iceberg?” That– That had to be the main discussion on all of the lifeboats, right? It was just a bunch of women being like, “So, he just didn’t see it?” “Isn’t that, like, literally his whole job? This is the most random ocean.” “I’m starving.” And, like, we’re living in a time right now where, like, a lot of people are confronting their oppression, and white women are really trying to be a part of that. We love being parts of stuff. We just want to be invited. You know, maybe do a little light decorating. Perhaps take it over completely. And I’m not saying white women weren’t oppressed. You know, for the longest time we couldn’t vote or have bank accounts, but for the most part, we had nicer houses. So it was a very different oppression. It was a very air-conditioned oppression. You know, we were the only ones in four-poster mahogany beds being like, “Sometimes things aren’t fair for me.” That’s where, men, you were very smart. This was a genius move. You kept us comfortable. That was very smart. It’s almost impossible to start a revolution from under a duvet. And then when we did start fighting for equality, we didn’t even do that right. We were like, “We want jobs!” And then black women were like, “We have those! In your house! We’re working for you right now! Your son calls me ‘Mom’ often!” Then we were like, “This is really confusing. Plus, the baby’s crying. Can you go do that? Yucky.” That’s the thing, white women, we’re the most privileged victim. We’re a privileged victim. We’ve seen privilege because we’re white, but we’ve seen disadvantage because we’re women. You know, we haven’t had it the best, but we have certainly not had it the worst. And I don’t really know where that leaves us. You know, you want to go with white men? All right, that’s fine, but you’re always gonna be under them. You want to go with women? All right, that’s fine, but you gotta advocate for black women and black men, and you’re probably always gonna be under them. I think the fact is that white women, I don’t think we’re ever gonna have it the best. I don’t think we’re ever gonna find greatness or glory, but maybe we can be the supporters. We can help other people get there. You know, we can sacrifice ourselves so that other people have it better. And maybe in that sacrifice, we can find some sort of satisfaction. And that… is how you play the victim! I almost had some of you, I could feel it. There was white women who were like, “I will martyr, I will be a martyr.” Black women were like, “No, this is a sneaky bitch.” Women, we’re complicated, we’re complex. I think the more we actually lean into that, the better things will get for us. Yeah, sometimes we make decisions with feelings and emotions. I don’t think that’s bad. I think men, it’s crazy that you don’t, you serial killers. Like, women, we’re complicated, we’re emotional. And I think the reason we’re that way is ’cause women, I actually think we’re a higher evolved species of human than men. -Like… You know how they say God made men first? I do believe that. I believe that God made men and then he goes, “Oh, good try, but… I think I can do better.” And then he made women, and he was like, “Oh, no, that’s a little much. I’ve really over-corrected. It’s too many shapes. That’s gonna be hard to clean.” I do, I think women, I think we’re a higher evolved species of human than men, and I don’t think we recognize that. I don’t think we recognize that men ar\",\n",
       "  'e just dumb idiots and we have to remind them of things. And for every woman out there that’s like, “Well, that’s not fair,” yeah, life’s not fucking fair, you princess! For every woman who’s like, “Well, men should just know.” No, that’s the bliss of being an idiot. You don’t know you’re an idiot. For every man who’s like, “I’m not an idiot.” Shut up, I’m trying to help you, you stupid idiot! You know when I realized men were first idiots? You ever watch a man fall asleep? Men will lay their head back and fall asleep immediately, like there wasn’t a thought in there to begin with. Just like… And then, this is how deep the idiot goes. Men are the ones most likely to get sleep apnea. Your own body forgets to breathe! Your own body’s like, “Whoa, sorry, man. I almost lost us there. You know what could really help, if we wore a Darth Vader mask the rest of our lives.” I mean, one of the best examples of this was when– Remember when we were getting really mad at men for man-spreading? You know, when they were spreading their legs too far in a subway or a train, and we were like, “It’s the patriarchy!” No, I promise you, he’s just a dumb idiot… who was like, “My balls are hot. I’m gonna have to figure this one out. Okay, nailed it. God, I’m so good at problems. I should be in charge of everything.” I guarantee you, it never even occurred to him that there are other people on the train. And, yeah, it’s not fair, but it’s your job as the higher evolved species to be like, “Hey, idiot, close your legs, I need room for my bag.” And I guarantee you, 95% of the time they’ll be like, “I am so sorry, I didn’t see you there, your boobs are small.” And I remember when this was happening, some women were like, “I don’t feel comfortable telling a man to close his legs.” And why is that? Is it because men are a lot stronger than us and they could really hurt you? I promise that’s the last time I’ll make this point. But, also, if you can’t tell a man to close his legs, you can’t be in power. Power is not given, power is taken. And I’m pretty sure I wrote that, or I stole it from Game of Thrones. And, yeah, it’s not ideal. In an ideal world we wouldn’t have to do this, but in an ideal world you wouldn’t have to put a sign outside a pool that says, “Don’t poop here.” Every single one of those dumb warnings are for men, every single one! They did not put up that sign because a lady pooped in the pool. All those warnings, on medicine, when it says, “Don’t take this if you’re allergic to it, you fucking idiot.” That’s for men! That’s why there’s a man in the crosswalk, so you can go, “Oh, yeah, it’s walking time.” On car commercials, when it says, “This is a professional driver on a closed course,” that’s for men! There’s no woman sitting at home being like, “I gotta buy a Chevy and find a cliff!” So… God made men, and he was like, “I can do better.” And then he made women and he was like, “That’s a little much.” And then he made gay men and he was like, “Yeah, that’s the right one.” “That works way better together. I’ll make lesbians while I’m at it, I’ll give them my carpentry skills.” I love lesbians. I think lesbians are the future. I don’t think they know what’s gonna happen, but I think they’re always prepared for several scenarios. But my favorite fact about lesbians is that for the longest time, no one believed they actually existed. Like, men couldn’t wrap their heads around lesbians, ’cause it didn’t involve a penis. That’s how important they think their penis is. They were like, “A puzzle piece is missing.” Like, gay men, they understood. They didn’t like it, but they were like, “There’s these crazy guys, they like a penis in the butt, and I don’t think about it all the time.” But gay men, they could wrap their heads around that. Lesbians, they were baffled. They were like, “No, it’s two ins, it’s not structurally sound. Believe me, I’m an engineer.” Are there gay men here? That sounds about right. I learned this about myself recently: I hate gay men. Not ’cause of anything you do sexually, very onboard with that, quite impressed. I have tried it once, and not for me. But way to power through. I hate gay men ’cause they’',\n",
       "  're better at being women than I am. Like, I thought I liked dick, and then I heard a gay guy talk about it, and I was like, “Oh, no, I think it’s just okay.” Gay guys talk about dick the way men wished women talked about dick. Straight men, if you want someone to love your dick, be gay! Gay guys talk about dick the way kids talk about Christmas. They’re like, “Is it here yet? Can I open it?” Women, we talk about dick the way Jews talk about Christmas. We’re like, “The music is nice, but I don’t think it needs to start in October. Also, holiday’s over, let’s wrap it up, it’s wintertime.” I do think this is the crux of a lot of our problems. I think men– I think you think your penis is more important to us than it is. It’s important to you, and it should be, it’s yours, but we do not care about it… as much as you do. I think we also don’t care about big dicks as much as men do. Men talk about big dicks a lot. It really… It seems to be on your minds. You’re always saying stuff like, “She needs a big dick!” You… you should ask us. We’re all different. I have a short torso. This is a finite amount of space. I think we should start thinking about penises and vaginas as a foot-in-a-shoe situation. You ever try to jam your foot into a shoe that’s two sizes too small? Imagine if the shoe had feelings. And you cared. We should all know our size. At the end of a night at a bar a guy should be like, “I’m an eight,” and you’d be like, “Well, I’m a four so, no.” Or a guy’d be like, “I’m a two,” you’d be like, “You should lie about that. Or show me a picture of your apartment.” A two with a good apartment is a six, that’s just math. And we should talk about dicks in sizes, sizes that we all know and understand. We have to stop talking about dicks in inches, because I don’t know how much an inch is. You know how I know a penis is too big? I see it and I go, “Oh, no.” “No, you think I’m a different person. You think I’m old Long Vagina.” “She needs a big dick!” All right, what do you think I want out of sex, a hole in my back? To become a dolphin? Which, vocally, does make sense. And, look, I’ve had sex with guys with big dicks. Sometimes I’ll sort of move away, they’ll be like, “Where are you going?” And I’m like, “To safety.” You know, in boxing, if you punch someone in the liver, it’s illegal. And yet, men still say, “She needs a big dick!” No, she needs you to text her back. And I’m sure– I’m sure there’s some women in here whose preference is a big dick, and that’s fine, to each their own. Me personally, more of a strong medium. Small is still not on the table. Small’s– If you have a small penis, you should kill yourself. It’s an honor killing! It’s good! I feel like this is what Goldilocks was originally about. And then they were like, “No, we’re not gonna be able to read this to children.” “Even in Germany?” “Yeah.” “All right, ‘porridge,’ but you get it.” And I know, I know I just said a very mean thing. I said men with small penises should kill themselves, and that’s a really mean thing to say. It’s also a very funny thing to say, ’cause no man with a small penis can ever get mad at me for that without immediately revealing himself. And it’s crazy because we really only talk about big penises and little penises. We don’t talk about what I think is the worst penis out there, the skinny penis, the wisp of wind, the ghost. I blame part of this on us women. I don’t think we talk about it ’cause we’re worried men are gonna be like, “I don’t have a skinny penis! You just have a giant vagina!” No, dude, you got a skinny penis. Looks like a witch’s finger. Are you trying to have sex with me or cast a spell? Wand down, Harry Potter. But there is one important question I don’t think we’re asking ourselves right now, and I think this is really important to address in the time that we’re in as a society. And that is… do you think moms want to know how their sons’ penis turned out? I know, bit of a left turn. In the joke, hopefully not the penis. I just think she had a lot to do with that, and then she never got to see what grade she got. Think about it, she grew the penis for a while, and then she had the baby, and for several ',\n",
       "  'years made sure the penis was safe and clean, and then this poor woman sent that penis out into the world, and she never got to see how the movie ended. I think, men, I think you should show your mom your penis. I think you’re out there showing your penis to people who don’t want to see it, show it to the one person… who really wants to see it. Your mommy! Go ahead, pull out your phones right now! I know y’all got a dick pic on there! Send that sweet, sweet dick pic to your mommy! And she’ll be like, “Oh! There’s my little guy.” I have been getting called vulgar a lot lately. Like, when I did the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, right– It’s fine, it was a job, it didn’t pay well. Then afterward all these people were like, “You ruined the dinner,” and I was like, “I ruin every dinner. Did you do no research?” But right before I went up to give my speech, and this is a 100% true story, the guy who was sitting on my right, he was a reporter from Dallas, he leaned over and he goes, “I watched your HBO special before this ’cause I wanted to see what kind of comedy you do.” And I was like, “Oh, glad somebody did.” And he goes, “I have to admit, I think you’re pretty vulgar,” and I was like, “Oh, if you think I’m vulgar, you should hear male comics.” ‘Cause I know all the stuff I talk about, periods, pussies, dicks… There’s other stuff, but we hit those pretty hard. And as soon as I talk about that, a lot of people, especially a lot of other women, are like, “She’s vulgar! She’s nasty! Not a lady!” But men talk about almost all the same stuff. I mean, maybe not otter rape, but almost all the same stuff. And as soon as men do it, people are like, “Yeah, but they’re men. Men are gross.” Which is crazy ’cause women are so much grosser than men! We’re disgusting! This is why we gotta stop being cute! Every hot woman you know shits furiously! And that’s not the worst of it. Do you know how much stuff falls out of my vagina every month? I’m not talking about during my period, I’m talking the other weeks. The gloops and the globs. Which is also the name of the children’s book I’m working on. “Gloop! Gloop! Glob! Glob!” Like, sometimes I look down at my underwear and I’m like, “That can’t be right.” So, then I google it and I’m like, “No, that’s definitely in the spectrum.” It makes me– It makes me feel so bad for women before Google, you know, where you just had to, like, go up to a neighbor and be like, “Hey, you ever get, like, an off-white– You know what? No, never mind. No, I just– I’d rather die than have this conversation.” And, like, men try to be gross. Like, it’s almost adorable. You know, they’ll say things like, “Oh, skid marks!” Yeah, okay. Sometimes I look down at my underwear and I’m like, “Did I put toothpaste down there? Three years ago? Oh, and also skid marks. I got a butt, too!” So, yeah, if you want to call me vulgar, go ahead, I’m a vulgar, disgusting bitch! And I am– I am happy to admit that now, but I gotta be honest, it took me a little bit to get there. You know, I didn’t want to be called vulgar at first. No, I think what I needed, I needed to see an example of someone else. You know, like, I need to see someone else be vulgar that’s not supposed to be to know it was really okay. I guess what I’m trying to say is, I learned it from the President. And I hope all your daughters do too, you fucking pussies!

       " ['Wow. Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part. The, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly',\n",
       "  ' often. Yeah, I just don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just… This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.” I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.” This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-rou',\n",
       "  'nd draft pick for our new activity.” I was like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good. So… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scra',\n",
       "  'mbling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.” As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We di',\n",
       "  'dn’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.” So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.” The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’',\n",
       "  't think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.” You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!” So we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amand',\n",
       "  'a was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.” So… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What wa',\n",
       "  's he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.” So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.” At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’',\n",
       "  's in another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for',\n",
       "  ' the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.

       " ['[gentle music playing] [audience applauding] [audience cheering] All right, let me explain. Friend of mine… “Former friend,” we’ll call her. [audience laughter] …is an artist, right? And the theme of our friendship is kind of feeling alone in the world. Right? So I wrote this show, which is about that feeling. And I sent her the script and I was like, “Hey, can you make a backdrop for me?” She’s like, “I got you.” And then two days ago, she sends me this. [audience laughter] Which feels less like alienation and more like a second grade speech therapist’s office. [audience laughter] I’m like, “How am I supposed to arrange these things?” She’s like, “Oh, you’ll figure it out.” [audience laughter] So, I’m going to be talking to you guys… all night, but, I’m going to be preoccupied with trying to satisfy her. None of this should surprise me. Is your life going smoothly? [audience laughter] Are you just floating from event to event, feeling good about yourself? ‘Cause I’m not. Most interactions I have feel like when you go to throw something away and it’s in one of those garbage cans that’s got a garbage hole, a recycling hole, and a compost hole. You do your best, but after you’re like, “I don’t think I did that right.” [audience laughter] That’s how I feel most of the time. Going through life feeling like I fucked up, and I’m going to get in trouble. I worry that my final thought on Earth, on my deathbed, is going to be, “Is that nurse mad at me?” [imitates flatline beep] [audience laughter] These are technically the areas of my life that make me feel like something’s wrong with me. Some of them are more important than others. We can start small. We’ll start with dogs. Right? So, I never had pets growing up, right? But I watch videos of dogs and they’re so funny and loving, and soldiers come back from overseas, the dog’s freaking out, the soldier’s freaking out, the dog’s fucking his face. I’m like, you know what? I should get a dog. [audience laughter] So I get a pit bull named Keith. And um, everybody told me, “Keith’s going to be your best friend.” And I gotta say, maybe my ninth-best friend. [audience laughter] Like, we’re cool, but whatever that thing is that opens up between humans and animals just never opened up. And then I go, “Do I not understand human-dog relationships or am I the only person who understands human-dog relationships?” ‘Cause everybody asks the same question, “Is he a rescue?” Yeah, they’re all rescues. [audience laughter] None of these dogs are thriving on their own. [audience laughter] Never heard a story like, “Where’d you get your Labradoodle?” “Went into Bank of America. She was the manager.” [audience laughter] “Now she’s our full-time Labradoodle.” I shouldn’t even say I rescued it. People love patting themselves on the back. “We rescued it, saved it, adopted it.” No, you didn’t. Here’s what happened to your dog, my dog, every dog. The dog was born into a litter, kidnapped, given to you. [audience laughter] “No, Neal. You don’t understand. I’m a dog mom.” Really? You know who else was a dog mom? That dog’s mom. [audience laughter] [applause] We think because we talk to dogs like they’re babies, they’re babies. They’re not. They’re our captives. Right? But we think because we go, “Are you a pretty girl?” Pitch your voice down. See what a monster you are. “Are you a pretty girl?” [audience laughter] “We can go outside. I have to put a chain around your neck.” [audience laughter] “Do a trick for me. I’ll give you a tiny morsel of food.” [audience laughter] “You’re my best friend.” [audience laughter] We try to make movies about it romanticizing the relationship, like Marley & Me. You know what a dog sees in\\xa0Marley & Me? He sees Taken, but Liam Neeson never shows up. [audience laughter] [sighs] And, by the way, I think it’s my fault. Something’s wrong with me. Uh… So I’d read books about loving dogs… Just… Like, okay, so is this thing… Is this for my LGBT joke? Or is she trying to tell me I’m on the spectrum? [audience laughter] Even groups you’d think I’d feel like I’m a part of, I don’t feel like I’m a part of.\\xa0Like… liberals. Clearly liberal. Look at me. Bone-thin. [audience laughter] I look like Rachel Maddow with a beard. [audience laughter] But I don’t feel like part of the group, ’cause liberals are the least-welcoming people on the planet. Republicans are having a blast. Grabbing pussy, shooting guns like Westworld. [audience laughter] Republicans get to be greedy. Republicans care about themselves, their families, rich people, that’s it. Liberals got to care about everybody. Not fetuses.\\xa0But everybody else. Am I right, liberals? [exclaiming] Fuck a fetus. Who’s with me, liberals? [audience exclaiming] I will punt a fetus down Wilshire if I see one. [audience laughter] The problem being liberal is there’s no amount of liberal that’s liberal enough. If there’s a bunch ',\n",
       "  \"of Republicans and someone goes, “I’m a Republican.” They go, “Come on in.” If there’s a bunch of liberals and a liberal goes, “Hey, I’m liberal,” they’re like, “We’ll see.” [audience laughter] You can believe the right shit as a liberal, but if you express it incorrectly, you’re fucked. It’s terrifying. Ever try to talk about transgender issues in public? Even right now you’re like, “We don’t gotta do this.” [audience laughter] “Don’t go out like your boy. Just move on.” [audience laughter] [audience cheering] But that’s exactly my point. It’s terrifying. I’m sure we all believe the right shit, but you ever… Trying to talk about transgender issues in public is like playing conversational Jenga. You’re like… “Pronouns…” “He… They…” Then Republicans are like, “Trannies? We’ll call ’em trannies?” [thud] [audience laughter] “What happened here? You guys playing Jenga?” [audience laughter] “I fucking love Jenga. Rack ’em up.” There’s a lot of little conundrums as a liberal, right? Like, I live in Venice, California, in LA. [man whoops] Yeah. And there’s a lot of homeless people in Venice. But I’m from New York, so it’s hard to take LA homeless people seriously. [audience laughter] It’s like once you work with the best, you know? [audience laughter] So… So one day I get home, and I got an… email. Paper email. A letter, we’ll call it. [audience laughter] The letter says, “We’re opening a homeless shelter.” As a liberal, that’s great. I keep reading. It says, “Across the street from your house.” I was like, “Oh shit.” [audience laughter] It was like being on a game show like How Liberal Are You? Like, “Uh…” [audience laughter] “I wrote a Black TV show.” [audience laughter] Yeah. My neighbors want to protest and shit. I’m not going to protest. I’m going to move. But I’m not going to… [audience laughter] No, I didn’t move. They opened the shelter. It’s not bad. It’s fine. How Liberal Are You? would be a funny game show, wouldn’t it? “You’re at an airport and a Muslim-looking man asks you to watch his luggage while he prays.” How Liberal Are You? [audience laughter] “Pass!” [audience laughter] You know who’s a liberal conundrum, as a person? Kanye. Yeah, ’cause when Kanye first started, he said, “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people.” Conservatives were like, “He needs to shut the fuck up.” Liberals were like, “Let him speak.” Then he started saying how much he liked Trump and liberals were like, “He does need to shut the fuck up.” [audience laughter] People at this point are just exhausted by Kanye. People are like, “That guy’s fucking crazy.” Yeah. No kidding. He’s a rapper. Since when do you rely on rappers for their emotional stability? [audience laughter] What’s your argument?\\xa0“Back in my day, there was a guy named Flavor Flav.” [audience laughter] “And he’d walk around and say, ‘You know what time it is!'” “And we did know. He had a fucking giant clock on his chest.” [audience laughter] “There was another fella named DMX who’d smoke crack and bark at people.” [audience laughter] “He’d go…” [barks] “And we knew where he stood.” [audience laughter] “His bark was as good as his word.” [audience laughter] “There was another named Eminem who’d make albums about murdering his wife.” “These are normal people we are talking about.” This. Maybe she’ll like this. Yeah, guns. I lose liberals on guns. I would like to, before I talk about this, say that I am afraid of guns, but it turns out the cops are too. [chuckles] [audience cheering and applauding] What’s the lesson we’re supposed to learn from Uvalde? Right? From Uvalde, Texas. Are we supposed to just… It’s always got to be a good guy with a gun? That’s the only way to stop it? Right? Everyone… The whole country’s going to be good guys with guns. Everywhere you go, “Freeze!” “You freeze!” “I’m already frozen!” Just fucking… [audience laughter] Also, if it’s up to us to stop guns, you know, speeding kills thousands of people every year. Are we supposed to stop that too? We’re supposed to run them off the road? If we see a speeder coming up, “You know what they say, the only thing that stops bad guy in a car is a good guy in a car.” Neew! [audience laughter] Yeah, my problem with guns is I don’t buy either side’s arguments completely. So the conservative argument is that guns are in the Constitution because the Founding Fathers thought if the citizens have guns the government will do what they say or else the people will rise up and fight the government. Which is a legitimately great idea in the 1700s, but… problem is, there’s still people now hoarding weapons thinking that, at some point, they may need to take on the American military, and they think they have a shot, right? [audience laughter] And look, maybe they’re right, which is why I’m proposing we test their theory, and once a year have a head-to-head showdown. [audience laughing, cheering] Say 100 \",\n",
       "  'members of the NRA versus, I don’t know, two members of the military. [audience laughter] Broadcast it on Fox, Christmas Day. [audience laughter] “Merry Christmas and welcome to the 2022 NRA-Military Showdown.” “Let’s go down to the field of battle, meet one of our NRA combatants.” “What’s your name? What kind of weapon?” “My name’s Andy Baker, and I got an AR-15, wearing Kevlar head-to-toe.” “How confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10?” “Fuckin’ a million.” [audience laughter] “We’re going to check in with the military.” They cut to one guy by himself, in a bunker, and he’s like, “My name is Staff Sgt.\\xa0Jeremiah Walker.” “What kind of weapon are you working with?” “I don’t know if this is fair, but I’m working with a drone.” [audience laughter] “It’s equipped with eight Hellfire missiles and a high-power camera.” “As you can see on this monitor, the NRA fellas are in one big cluster.” [audience laughter] “So, I’m going to…” “We started? All right.” [audience laughter] “Yeah, so I’m going to hit this button right here.” [audience laughter] “Yeah, now they’re all dead.” [audience laughter] “That’ll do it for this year’s NRA-Military Showdown.” [audience cheering and clapping] “Brought to you by Whole Foods.” [audience laughter] You know the NRA guys would be like, “We can take ’em next year. Just got to split up.” [audience laughter] That’s the conservative argument, and the liberal argument is that, uh, the gun stats in America are just horrifying, right? And they are on their face, right? 40,000 gun deaths a year. Which is awful. But, you know what they never tell you? You know how many of those are suicides? Two-thirds are suicides. No one ever knows that. So whenever there’s a mass shooting on television, which are legitimately tragic, liberals always run on TV and say, “We don’t need mental health care. We need common-sense gun control.” No. How about both? Right? How about one question at the point of sale? Find out who’s depressed, who isn’t, and two-thirds of gun deaths right there. Guy comes in and they go, “Before we sell you this weapon, can we just look at your browser history real quick?” [audience laughter] He goes, “Sir, you’ve been listening to Lana Del Rey.” [audience laughter] “And staring at pictures of your ex. We’re not going to give you a gun today, but we are going to give you a bag of mushrooms and a copy of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.” [audience laughter] [audience clapping and cheering] “You’re gonna be back on your feet and talking with your butt cheeks in no time.” [audience laughter] So now we’re down to about 13,000 gun deaths a year, which is atrocious. But, by the way, you know how many people the flu kills in the average year? 50,000. If you’re worried you’ll be murdered by a gun, think about how scared you are of dying from the flu… You’re not. …divide it by three, and I’ll meet you there. By the way, do you see how I think myself into isolated, asshole-y positions? About everything for as long as I can remember. Even I hear myself sometimes and I’m like, “Just shut the fuck up.” I got to be the only person who was ever asked, “Would you rather be right or happy?” And I was like… “Ugh…” [audience laughter] Something’s wrong with me. And, by the way, I work against all my\\xa0instincts with this. You know, I give to every liberal group you can think of. I give to so many… I give to an anti-capitalist group. How fucking dumb is that? And they have the balls to hit me up for donations. “Can we get another 100 bucks for our anti-capitalism group?” I’m like, “But you know how I’m getting this money, don’t you?” [audience laughter] Oh yeah. Maybe you’re thinking like, “Neal, why don’t you smoke some weed?” “Chill the fuck out.” That’s not up there ’cause I love weed. That’s up there ’cause I don’t think recreational drugs work on me right. Like MDMA. Molly, ecstasy, depending how old you are. [audience laughter] Uh… I… I’ve done it seven or eight times. Never worked on me once. There’s people whose brains don’t respond to MDMA. Guess I have one of those brains. My friends do not have one of those brains. That was pretty awkward. They’re all rubbing each other’s nipples, and I’m just like… [fake laughter] [audience laughter] Yeah, and I don’t think weed works on me either. Unless, is weed supposed to make you violently paranoid for five minutes, then you got to go to sleep? Is that weed? [audience laughter] ‘Cause in that case,\\xa0bull’s-eye. I feel bad too because we’re living in the golden age of weed. Weed is legal in so many places. It’s legal out here. Uh… They sponsor comedy shows, so I get bags and vapes and pipes. I have so much weed at my house that I cannot use, I’ve become like an old lady with a lemon tree in her backyard. I’m like, “Take some weed.” [audience laughter] So weed’s legal. Shrooms just got legalized in Denver, Oakland, all of Oregon. Yeah. Yeah. [audience c',\n",
       "  'heering] So there’s going to be shroom stores. You ready? You’ll go to a shroom store and go, “You open?” “I don’t know, are you open?” [audience laughter] I’m not mad at these drugs. MDMA, psilocybin, weed all passed the FDA hurdles for safety. Uh, but you know what wouldn’t pass the FDA hurdles for safety? Alcohol. For safety? Like, if they tested out whiskey in a lab. 100 men, 100 women, scientists dispensing it, marking down the results, they go to their boss. “Sir, we did the whiskey test.” “Uh, first one or two drinks, people seemed warm and happy.” “Then around the third drink, a lot of the men became belligerent.” “The women were upset, but they said they didn’t want to talk about it.” [audience laughter] “And then a lot of people vomited and passed out, and everyone who drove home crashed their car.” [audience laughter] “That sounds awful.” “I know, here’s the crazy part.” “They all want to come back again on Saturday.” [audience laughter] “They’re wondering if we can hire a DJ.” “And two Israeli guys want to promote it. Does that…?” [audience laughter] So clearly I’m not a big drinker. The fucked-up thing about alcohol is it gets so much good PR. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always heard, “When you drink, your real self comes out.” Which is true to a point. Maybe one or two drinks. But I’ve never looked at one of my sloshed friends and been, “There’s the real Tony.” And they’re, “Ugh!” [grunting] “Fuck you guys!” “That is his God-given essence, right there.” [exclaims] The real Tony has to piss on the street. [audience laughter] Yeah, not a big drinker. Not a big smoker. People don’t like it. It is good for me. Not drinking and smoking. I know it’s good for me because when I tell people at parties, they say, “Good for you,” right before they walk away. [audience laughter] But alcohol is hard. It’s a tough issue for me ’cause I grew up with an alcoholic dad, right? Uh… and, you know, people love alcohol, and women are people. So… [audience laughter] Admit it. Um… And so dating is tough because I don’t want to be a drink cop, but at the same time, it can be a little triggering. Sometimes it’s fine. Other times it’s like, “Mmm, trauma.” Um… [audience laughing and clapping] Yeah, but I don’t know what I can ask for within this, right? Like, I just don’t know what’s… I go, “Who am I to tell her not to drink?” “As someone who’s trying to protect themselves?” “From what?” “I don’t know, a negative emotional experience? The smell of alcohol?” “Are you not fucking over that? How are you not fucking over that?” So I’ve just got this negative tape running in my head about that and pretty much most things in my life. I have a very… I got a bad inner monologue. I wrote it down one time, and as soon as I saw it, I was like, I got to erase this. Because if any of my friends know that someone’s talking to me like this, they’re going to be pissed. But meanwhile, it was an inside job, you know? You ever look back on your life and think the way you are is inevitable? If you don’t know much about me, I’m the youngest of ten kids, which is… too many. Right? Both my parents were born during the Great Depression, and they were nice enough to bring it with them. [audience laughter] Yeah, so both my parents brought that energy to their union, and it was just a lot of chaos and alcohol and law and order. Like, a lot of violence. My earliest… One of my earliest memories of life is watching my teenage brother fistfight my dad on the front lawn. It’s like, “Okay, so this is life.” Um… Yeah, just so many rules. Just constant rules. There were so many rules that eventually my mother wrote the important ones down and stuck them on the wall of the kitchen, like you’d see at a steel factory. My friend actually put them on here. I’ll tell you about some of them. Bunch of TV rules, which I guess makes sense. A lot of laundry rules. My mother was laundry-room crazy. Um, if you left your clothes in the laundry room for too long, my mother would confiscate your clothes. Disappeared, Khmer Rouge-style. [audience chuckling] Never to be seen again. Although one year for Christmas, my sister Anne did get a keychain, a candle, and a box of her old clothes back, so… Merry Christmas, Anne. Why are you crying? [audience laughter] A lot of sandwich rules. You guys probably all had sandwich rules, right? [audience laughter] We had to make all of… There were too many of us. We couldn’t all make sandwiches every morning before school, so we’d have to make them in bulk on the weekend and then stick them in the freezer. And then on the way to school, we grabbed one of our sandwiches. You’re thinking that must not have made for very fresh sandwiches, but you’re forgetting a more important piece of information. Sandwiches don’t always thaw between 8:00 a.m. and lunchtime. [audience laughter] In those cases, we’d eat around the edges like rats on',\n",
       "  \" a pirate ship. [audience laughter] So, pretty much the Gilmore Girls is what I’m saying. Yeah, so I grew up Catholic. Anybody else? [cheering] Yeah, I did all the Catholic milestones. Baptism, First Holy Communion, Confirmation, atheism. Right? [audience laughter] [applause] I shouldn’t even say I’m an atheist. Let’s say I’m agnostic about my atheism, right? Atheists are such smug hypocrites, by the way. Atheists will be like, “You pray to a god? That’s so silly.” “Can I show you my vision board real quick?” [audience laughter] I know a lot of white atheists. I don’t know many Black atheists. Not none, just not many. I got a theory about why there’s not many Black atheists. Here goes. Atheism is really like the height of white privilege. It really is. Religion says, “Can we interest you in an afterlife?” And white people are like, “No, thank you.” [chuckles] [audience laughter] “How much better could it be?” [audience laughter] “I’ll just take my supplements and see what happens.” White privilege has had a big couple years, huh? Yeah. The Cauckies, the Caucasians. [audience laughter] Cauckies were blindsided in 2020. They were just caught unawares, right? I was talking to a white lady. She says, “I had no idea things were so bad between Black people and the police.” I was like, “There’s no way you could’ve, unless you listen to any song by a Black person, ever.” [audience laughter] Like, what do you think “Fuck tha Police” was about, lady? “I didn’t think it was all police. I thought it was one precinct.” How about Bob Marley’s “I Shot the Sheriff”? “I know, but he didn’t shoot the deputy, so…” [audience laughter] I like the white privilege that’s hiding in plain sight. You know what’s a white privilege thing that’s hiding? A lot of American city names are white privilege. Like Chicago, Milwaukee, those are Native American words. West Coast is wild. San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego. Spanish names. Ever think about why they’re Spanish? Well… ‘Cause we jacked the motherfuckers from Mexico, didn’t even bother changing the names. [audience laughter] That is some ice-cold white privilege shit. That’d be like if your boy Pete had a girlfriend for years. “Pete’s girl.” Then you steal her, take her to a party, you’re like, “You know my girl Pete’s girl, don’t you?” [audience laughter] “You thirsty, baby? Get Pete’s girl a drink, would you?” “I got you a necklace with your initials on it. PG. Pete’s girl.” You know what’s white privilege? Joking about race. That’s white privilege. ‘Cause as a white person, it just bounces right off. Right? I know the funniest, meanest Black dudes in the world. They’ll be like, “White people can’t dance. No rhythm.” I’ll be like, “Who needs rhythm when you own the record label?” [audience laughter] [audience continues laughing] Am I TikToking? Be honest. Is this TikTok? [audience laughter] A lot of Cauckies ask me, they go, “Neal…” “Neal, I’m a good Cauckie. What can I do?” “How can I combat white privilege?” Acknowledge it as it’s happening to you. This happened to me recently. I got pulled over doing 73 in a 35. So it was tight. [audience laughter] And white cop. I get my license and registration. He’s back running my plates, and I’m sitting there going, “I deserve whatever. A fine or a ticket.” “Whatever I’m going to get, I totally deserve.” He comes back. He’s like, “I’ll let you off with a warning.” I’m like, no, that’s fucked up. ‘Cause I know my Black or brown friends would at least be getting a ticket. I gotta say something. I was like, “Don’t be stupid. He’s a cop.” I was like, “No, now’s the time.” And I said, “Thanks, officer. It’s been a white privilege.” [audience laughter] He said, “The privilege is all white.” What the fuck? [audience laughter] Race is another one\\xa0of these issues that’s a weird one for me, ’cause it’s had an oddly big effect on my life. Not anywhere near a person of color, but 50 times the average Cauckie. Uh… [audience chuckles] And I’m good at writing racial jokes, and I’m like, is it my place to tell them? Like, if they fall into the wrong hands… Like, that “who needs rhythm when you own the record label” joke, that would crush at a Klan rally. Crush. [audience laughter] You can hear it. “So I said, ‘Who needs rhythm when you own the record label?'” “Good night. My name’s Jedediah.” [audience laughter] So it’s like, should I not tell the jokes in public? Like, I know what my intentions are, but, like, who gives a shit what my intentions are if they’re… misinterpreted? Pretty accessible comedy show, huh, folks? [audience laughter] I’m in a tiny theater, moralizing about race. Meanwhile, Kevin Hart’s in an arena, “I tell you about the time I went to Egypt and a camel bit me in the dick?” [audience laughter] Something… Something’s wrong with me. Oh, you know what? I think this is a woman’s shoe. You might be thinking like, “Neal, if you got\",\n",
       "  ' married and had kids some of your… alienation might dissipate.” Maybe. I don’t know. Never been married. Don’t have kids. 48 years old. People don’t like it. [audience laughter] It’s worse for women if you’re over a certain age. Not married, no kids, people pity you. But as a guy, people are suspicious. [audience laughter] I would get more trust from women if I’d been married and murdered my wife. [audience laughter] They’d be like, “He’s capable of love. He gets too passionate.” [audience laughter] “Also, he’s not going to murder two people.” [audience laughter] Cute. Yeah, it’s not… I’ve… I’ve been in long-term relationships. Been in love a few times. It just never got to marriage. It just never got there. These are big risks, these relationships, ’cause… ’cause… You’re basically just doing a daily trust fall with somebody, right? Every day you’d be like, “Okay. Your turn. Okay, here we go.” Aah! “Oh my God, this is so fun. Do me.” “Okay, here we go. I got you.” Aah! “Oh my God, I feel so connected to you. We’re so lucky.” “Do me again.” Aah! [thud] I’ve hurt people as the catcher, and I’ve been hurt as the faller. They both suck for different reasons. The thing with these relationships is, you just have to believe in each other and assure one another, like, “We both feel the same way.” “I feel the same about you as you do me. We’re connected, we’re connected.” And then a certain point, they look at you and go, “Oh, I’ve been pretending.” “We’re… we’re… we’re not connected.” And then you have to parse the relationship to try to figure out when they started pretending. And then eventually accept the fact that some of the most cherished memories of your life may have been a grift. Shit’s breathtaking. I judge myself a lot for this. This is where I’m like, “Something really is wrong with you.” You know, other comedians judge me for it. I was talking to a comedian friend. He’s like, “You’d be more popular if you were married with kids.” I said, “Why?” And he’s like, “The audience trusts you more if you’re married with kids ’cause you’re moral.” “You put other people ahead of you.” Uh, which I’ve legally never done. I have a dog. You’re like, “Which one? The one you don’t love?” Fuck you guys. [audience laughter] I’m not telling you shit anymore. But I get how, as an audience member, you trust comedians more if they’re married with kids. I do have one follow-up question. How is Bill Cosby’s marriage? Any word? [audience cheering] Is Louis C.K. still happily married? He’s fucking hilarious. He must be married. I had one more, and I need you guys to give it to me straight. John Mulaney? [audience exclaiming] Don’t fucking “oh” me. I went to the goddamn wedding. [audience laughter] Yeah. I don’t know what you spent. I had to fly across country, rent a car. They’re like, “Wanna upgrade for $30?” I’m like, “It’s Mulaney’s wedding. Let’s blow it out.” Cut to me in a PT Cruiser going, “Was this an upgrade?” [audience laughter] Well, at least Woody Allen’s marriage is still flourishing, huh? [audience clapping] Did you see that documentary? Allen v. Farrow? Uh, they lay out the case pretty conclusively that before he married his stepdaughter Soon-Yi, he molested his other stepdaughter. And I got to say, it’s probably my least favorite Woody Allen movie. [audience laughter] My failure in relationships is not for lack of trying, I swear to God. Like, I’ve done different approaches, love language, attachment style. Age, race, weight, job. I dated a model. Thank you. [audience laughter] Guys, dating a model is like owning a dune buggy. Dating a model’s like owning a dune buggy ’cause at the beach, it’s great. But everywhere else, you’re like, “I shouldn’t have brought you here.” [audience laughter] [audience cheering] By the way, this is all going to be heterosexual. Like, I don’t have any gay insights. Never been gay. I check once a year. [audience laughter] I do. If you’re honest, check once a year. I go on Pornhub, I click the “gay” button, and I go, “Anything?” “All right, back to women.” [audience laughter] While I haven’t been gay, I have experienced a ton of homophobia ’cause I have a bidet. [audience laughter] My straight guy friends will be like, “Can’t do it, bro.” “Can’t have water shooting up my ass.” Are you worried about… Look, if the only thing keeping you from being gay is water hitting your ass… [audience laughter] …you are gay. [audience laughter] Just be gay. Come on over, take a ride on the pony, start your new life. That’s how rudimentary guys’ understanding of our sexuality is. We’re like, “I just got to protect the flag.” “And everything’s the same.” Fellas, no, you don’t. I’m 48. The flag’s been violated or whatever. I’ve had a couple fingers in the butt. From women. Nothing happened. Nothing changed. I wasn’t like, “My identity!” [audience laughter] “Everything I thought I was!” [audience l',\n",
       "  'aughter] “Turn off Rogan, turn on Drag Race.” [audience laughter] You know what the first thing that always left in my relationships? Uh, appreciation for one another. Right? It happens in most relationships. We stop appreciating each other. Women start thinking, “Men are so thoughtless and stupid.” And men think, “Women are so fussy and high-maintenance.” And we’re both right. Women, you are fussy and high-maintenance. You know what else? They’re sophisticated and elegant, and can make emotional connections including, get this, direct eye contact. Women’s spirit is just elevating. They can transform a room with their presence and energy. I’m thankful there’s women here tonight. If there were no women here tonight, fellas, with just all dudes in a dark room staring at me… [audience laughter] …you know what the energy would be? Proud Boys, and you know it. [audience laughter] Just a bunch of guys in cut-off leather gloves and wearing their horrible sunglasses like this for some reason. [audience laughter] And women, you think men are thoughtless and stupid, and we are. But you know what else we are? Fucking hilarious. [audience laughing and applauding] We are. We’re very funny. Women are beautifully constructive, and men are hilariously destructive. Right? If you ever go to an all-women’s event, it’s just a bunch of women making eye contact and drinking white wine. [makes high-pitched sound] Eventually you’re like, “I gotta get the fuck out of here.” Right? But usually guys show up to kind of ground the energy, and we’re there, we’re trying to… We’re always trying to impress. We’re buying you shit, we’re break dancing… [audience laughter] …doing magic tricks, backflips. We’re telling stories with sound effects. “Then I punched him in the stomach.” Pssh! Then he took out a machine gun.” Trrrr! I’ve never heard a woman do a sound effect in my entire life. [audience applauds] Noises… Like birds’ chirps, meows, shit you could do. We’re always trying to make you laugh. We got funny mean nicknames for our friends. “This is Mike, aka Boner Mike.” [audience laughter] “Aka Illiterate Mike.” I never heard a woman be like, “This is Sarah, aka Barren Sarah.” [audience laughter] “She’s so dry down there, we call her Sahara.” [audience laughter] [audience laughing and whopping] [audience laughter] [sniffles] I just don’t have any like, real innate skill for being a boyfriend. Like, I’m thankful that there’s not an entrance exam to become a boyfriend ’cause I would fail that shit miserably. The woman would come with the results. “All right.” “We’re not going to pass you. I think you knew that.” [audience laughter] “Couple areas in which you didn’t do well, one of them was listening.” “Um, question was, ‘If you’re watching basketball on TV and your girlfriend needed to speak to you,\\xa0how would you handle it?’ We were looking for, ‘Turn the TV off, and ask what was going on, ‘ but you wrote down, ‘I’d turn the TV up.’ [audience laughter] ‘And say, “I can’t talk right now, babe. It’s the first quarter, which is one of the most important quarters.”‘ [audience laughter] “You also did poorly in conflict resolution.” “The question was, ‘If she had an issue with something you did, how would you deal with it?’ And you wrote down, ‘I’d think of a time she did something similar, and say, “See, bitch? Now we’re even.”‘ [audience laughter] Back to the apps for you, my friend. Yeah, something’s wrong with me, like… The other thing I’m not dying to get into with relationships is the power dynamic. ‘Cause I feel like men had all the power for 400,000 years, give or take. And about six years ago, women were like, “May we?” [audience laughter] I shouldn’t say men have no power. I should be more specific. Liberal white men have no power in relationships. At this period in history, as a liberal white man, you now have to go to protests against myself. Understand? [audience laughter] I… [applause] When the George Floyd protests broke out, I was like, “I’ll get my sign from the Women’s March. Here.” “I am the problem!” [audience laughter] I went to the Women’s March. It was inspiring on the one hand, and I also saw the funniest thing I’ve ever seen, right? So, inspiring, 400,000 women, their husbands, boyfriends, sons, dads, all together, marching for a cause. That was incredible. And then I also saw the funniest shit ever, uh… We all had signs that we made, right? And there was another guy there, and he had a sign that said, “This is what a feminist looks like,” with an arrow pointing at him. He and I are walking along, we make eye contact, the guy looks up at his sign and goes… [audience laughter] So we’ll see what happens. [audience chuckling] [man] Oh, my God. [chuckling] Yeah, I’ve dated a\\xa0lot of women that were correctors. I had two different girlfriends in my life say in front of me, “I trained him.” [audience muttering] “I taught h',\n",
       "  'im.” Yeah. Ever hear a guy say that? No, ’cause you don’t know any pimps. [audience laughter] [chuckling] Yeah. And you do teach us shit, women, but it’s never shit we want to know. Shit you want us to know. Never had a girlfriend be like, “Let me show you how to choke a wolf.” [audience laughter] It’s always girly shit that you want us to know, and then we go, [in squeaky voice] “Oh yeah.” [audience laughter] That’s the sound of a guy learning shit he does not care about in the slightest. “Oh yeah.” [audience laughter] “Duvet cover, yeah.” [audience laughter] “Yeah, a blanket should have its own pouch.” [audience laughter] “Thank you, babe.” Happens to all guys, all over the world. Age, race, class. Doesn’t matter. We all know what happened with Meghan Markle and Harry Potter. Right? Is that his name? [audience laughter] We know what happened. She came home and was like, “I know we’re in England, you’re a prince, but your family sucks, so let’s go to America and you’re a fucking nobody.” And he was like… “Oh yeah.” [audience laughter] “Fuck a thousand years of tradition. Thanks, babe.” So much in relationships is luck. That’s the thing nobody talks about. It’s luck. So this is the thing I looked up. So there’s a one-in-eight chance that you will marry somebody you’re dating. There’s a 50-50 chance the marriage will work. So, in essence, there is a 6% chance that you’ll be in an everlasting loving relationship with someone you’re dating, even if they’re great and you’re great. 6%. That’s luck. And I know I need to pause the show right now and let all the guys that are here on dates look at your lady and let her know that you guys are the exception. [audience laughter] [man] Whoo! You’re going all the way. I get it. But 6%. It’s luck, right? Even if I’m wrong it’s 9, but it’s 6. It’s luck. We’re all… We all judge each other for our failures at relationships. We judge ourselves. We should have empathy. We’re all basically just fans at an NBA game taking a half-court shot. When those fans miss the shot, everyone goes, “Aww!” They don’t go, “Fuck you!” [audience laughter] “Think about why you missed that shot.” “Start with your relationship with your mother and go forward from there.” [audience laughter] And then, babies. I’m not anti-baby. [audience chuckles] I’m anti-fetus. Y’all know I’m anti-fetus. [audience laughter] I fucking hate fetuses. I fucking hate them. I wish a fetus would step to me. [audience laughter] Yeah, so, I gotta… I’ve just never looked down and been like, “I should reproduce this.” “Run it back. Let’s go.” You know what TV show made me wary of having kids? You guys ever see that show, the nightly news? [audience laughter] Alright, climate change is a nightmare. We’re already double what Earth’s population should be. I can’t remember this much anger or division in my life. Having a kid right now would be like being at a house party, it’s packed with people, you can’t move, roof’s on fire, basement’s flooding, cops are coming, you look at your friend and you’re like, “We should invite Brian.” [audience laughter] The problem is I gotta tell women on first dates I won’t have babies. I guess I don’t have to. It just seems nicer, right? Because women have weird timing with that shit. I was on a date with a girl and she’s like, “I am 40.” “I need to start thinking about who I’m going to have kids with.” I was like, “Start thinking?” [audience laughter] “Miss, we may be down to minutes.” [audience laughter] Yeah, I got to tell women on first dates that I don’t want to have kids. People don’t like it. Telling a woman on a first date is like going to a job interview and being like, “Just so you know, I don’t fuck with computers.” [audience laughter] “How do you want to do this?” Maybe it’s luck. Maybe it’s timing. Or, you know, could be both. Or maybe it’s me. Maybe something’s wrong with me. Maybe I’m too cranky, or wounded, or misogynistic. Or something I don’t even know I am. You know what I realized? [woman] It’s not you. It’s not me? Well, good. Let’s end the show. Good night, everybody. [audience laughter] [chuckles] Women, do you see the kind of belief I’m looking for? Just a little? Yeah, like, I had the thought recently that I don’t think I can guarantee a woman’s emotional safety. And I’m not sure she could guarantee mine. I wish that were not the case, but that’s just how I feel. And people go, “Well, don’t you get lonely?” Yeah. But also, I’ve never been lonelier than in a relationship I didn’t want to be in. [audience applauds] And then with kids… You know, I say it’s climate change… It’s not. Secret, it’s not. [audience laughter] I say it’s all that stuff, but it’s about the emotional connection ’cause I don’t want the kid to come out, and I don’t feel it. We all know what happened with Keith. [audience laughter] And more importantly, my dad had ten kids, didn’t love any of us,',\n",
       "  ' right? So I don’t want to… I’m half him, so I could repeat that all over again. And people are like, “You’d be such a good dad.” I’d be a good Marine too. I don’t want to be a Marine. Like, people go, “Well, try.” It’s not… “Take the leap.” It’s not my risk, it’s their risk. They bear all the risk, right? ‘Cause if you’re born with a parent who doesn’t love you, you spend your whole life thinking something’s wrong with you. I… I also got to say, I really resent the pressure we’re all under to do it. I really resent it. Right? There’s dozens of new gender and sexual orientations. There’s still only one relationship orientation. Toward marriage. “What about polyamory?” There’s no tax cuts for polyamory. Stop it. But people are really impressed with like, “We got married and signed a license.” “A marriage license? How’d you do it?” [audience laughter] A legal yoke isn’t that impressive to me. You know what I mean? What’s more meaningful? A bird in a cage? Or a bird that flies away every day and comes back just ’cause they like being birds with you? Isn’t that better? [audience applauds] People say stuff like, “Well…” Just the dumb shit. “If you don’t marry her, you won’t be able to visit her in the hospital after hours.” [audience laughter] I will if I give security 40 bucks. [audience laughter] There you go, bird. Also, you ever ask married people how it is? [audience laughter] The answers may shock you. By the way, it’s not just men. Ask a woman how marriage is, women sound like a politician ducking a hot-button issue. “Lisa, how are things with you and Mike?” And she’s like, “Kids are great.” [audience laughter] And you ask guys how the marriage is, guys sound like they’re reading a hostage letter. “Mike, how are things with you and Lisa?” And he’s like, “Hello.” [audience laughter] “I am happy.” [audience laughter] “Do not worry about me.” [audience laughter] “Worry about yourself… [audience laughter] …and your heathen lifestyle.” [audience laughter] “She has taught me so much… [audience laughter] …and made me a better man.” And she’s in the corner like ISIS like, “Tell him about the duvet cover.” [audience laughing and applauding] “Oh yeah.” [audience laughter] This is fun. It’s just fun to be out, right? Do you know what one of the upsides of COVID might be, I hope, is uh, empathy for mental health stuff, right? ‘Cause everybody was isolated. And human beings don’t do well with isolation. We’ve still got cave brains. So we think if we’re isolated that the tribe is rejecting us, and then we start picking away at ourselves and finding faults that aren’t there and… Basically, our mental health declines. So I hope in the future that people have empathy when someone says, “I’m depressed or anxious,” they’ll go, “Yeah, I remember that.” Because for a lot of us, we’ve felt isolated our whole lives. And the other thing I’ll say, one of the things I didn’t mind about COVID was that we could all just chill a bit with work. We could put the sword down a little bit. If you achieved something during COVID, cool. If not, also cool. The only people who accomplished anything during COVID to me were Bo Burnham… [audience laughter] Amazon.com, and the 1998 Chicago Bulls. Somehow. [applause] They, like, won again, right? But it was nice to chill out, but as soon as the world opened up, I was back comparing myself to other comedians, and seeing who was doing whose podcast, and who did what venue, and how many tickets they sold. And am I too old to be on TikTok? Can a person do lip-sync videos and be on cholesterol medication? [audience laughter] Yeah, like I said, comedy is so public, and it can be sort of… you know, it’s exposing. And, like I said, there’s a lot of ways in which I feel like I don’t fit into the world, and I’m not doing it especially good, but comedy’s one of these things where I feel like I know what I’m doing, I’m part of something, but there’s always a reminder like, “You don’t.” Right before the start of COVID, Netflix had a party. By the way, this story’s so name-droppy, I apologize in advance. This story’s so name-droppy, DiCaprio was there, I don’t even mention it. [audience laughter] So, uh… Netflix has a party, and it’s at the head of Netflix’s house. A guy named Ted Sarandos. A great man. [audience laughter] [woman cheers] A great man. [audience laughter] So it’s at Ted Sarandos’ house, and I walk in, and it’s the biggest comedians in the world, right? I look over, it’s Burr, Aziz, Mulaney, Ali Wong, Sarah Silverman, Wanda Sykes, Trevor Noah, Borat. [audience laughter] And you’re like, “Pretty good. Pretty big, Neal. All right.” Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Kevin Hart. And then I look over here, Ellen DeGeneres, Eddie Murphy. I was like, “God damn. I’ve never seen all these people together, ever.” Right? And I remember thinking, “Buddy, I don’t know what you did to get invited to this party,',\n",
       "  ' but it must’ve been pretty good, and I’m proud of you.” And I’m just looking around at all these\\xa0heroes of mine, right? Uh, all icons. And Ted Sarandos, who is a great man… [audience laughter] …gives a toast, and he goes, “It’s such a thrill for me to be in the same room with all of my comedy heroes.” And Chris Rock yells out, “And Neal Brennan!” [audience laughter] I just thought, “Man, I hope someday Chris gets humiliated in front of all of his peers.” [audience laughing and applauding] And a great joke, by the way. Like, the right joke to make. I wish I could’ve been somebody else so I could have enjoyed it more. I was like, “Oh fuck, I am Neal Brennan. Shit.” [audience laughter] You know in a movie when someone gets embarrassed and they cut to slo-mo shots of… “Ha, ha, ha.” My slo-mo shots were Ellen going… [distorted] “Ha, ha, ha.” And Borat was like, “My wife!” [audience laughter] But, yeah, it just made me, like, second-guess myself, as usual. ‘Cause all these people are such naturals. Dave started doing comedy at 14. He was good then. Eddie knew he was going to be on TV when he was five. Ellen called being on\\xa0The Tonight Show before she did stand-up. Like, just all these stories, right? And meanwhile, I did it completely backwards. I was a writer, then I became a comedian in my thirties, and I had to… I’m not a natural. I had to grind and take vocal lessons and movement classes. I listened to multiple audiobooks about charisma. Multiple. [audience laughter] I act like this is all past tense. I’m doing it now. See this thing? “It’s not a watch.” You’re right. It’s not. It’s called a Pavlok. This thing gives me a small electric shock every three minutes on stage to remind me to smile more. It’s been happening the entire show. [audience laughter] [audience applauds] Yeah, when I’m around people like that, I’m like, “Am I not supposed to be doing this?” By the way, what even is this? Why can’t I just do regular stand-up? Last time I was like, “I’m going to need three different microphones set up equidistant.” This one is… And this one… “Ugh…” “Ha, ha, ha, ha.” [audience laughter] And then this show I’m like, “Hey, everybody, I brought blocks!” [audience laughter] I’ve spent the last… 15 years of my life being a comedian. And every comedian I met was like, “You seem like more of a writer.” Which is comedians’ way of saying, “Give me your jokes.” Before that I was a writer, and every writer was like, “You seem like more of a comedian.” Which is writers’ way of saying, “You’re annoying.” [audience laughter] If just feels like comedians over here, writers over here. Neal, you can just stay in this middle area, with your little stand-up traumedy shows. [audience laughter] Did I mention I paid her for this? Individually… these things are all manageable, you know? But it’s… In totality, that’s the hard part. That’s where the depression comes. And I’ve tried so much stuff. Like, so much. Therapy, medication. Ketamine. I tried transcranial magnetic stimulation. [click] Ooh, okay… [loud clicking] That was good, but it kind of wore off. So then I went to China to get a stronger version of TMS which isn’t legal in the States. [loud clicking] It may not even be legal in China, for all I know. And then, I did 5-MeO-DMT. Like Bufo alvarius. It’s like the nuclear bomb of psychedelics. I think I went too far… with that one. Like, I think… I think I hurt myself a little bit. Yeah, but I guess it makes sense if you’re looking for a magic bullet, occasionally you’re going to get shot. But I just kept thinking, “Dude, how did you turn self-help into self-harm?” I’ve been saying all night that something’s wrong with me. And something is wrong with me. [gentle music playing] I won’t show myself any kindness. I won’t give myself any grace. Like, I just grind and attack myself relentlessly like it’s my job. I would love to stop. I like to believe that my ways of being, like my thoughts, my habits, my emotions, my beliefs… I’d like to believe that they’re not defects. I’d like to believe that alchemy of a personality… my spirit… it’s got to be enough. Please. Let that be enough.

       " ['“Roseanne Barr: Cancel This!” is a stand-up comedy special showcasing Roseanne Barr’s return to the stage, amid a backdrop of rock music and an enthusiastic audience. Barr’s routine is unapologetically controversial and provocative, a mix of personal anecdotes, political commentary, and observational humor that reflects her brash and unfiltered comedic style. She opens with a light-hearted jab at her fake nails and a brief prayer for mental clarity before diving into her material. Roseanne reminisces about her career beginnings in Houston, expressing gratitude and joking about the audience’s privilege to witness her performance. She navigates through topics like moving to Texas, gun rights, and the political divide within her family, labeling her daughters as “libtards” for their differing views. Her act then takes a more personal turn as she discusses her controversial firing from her television show, attributing it to a racially charged tweet that she insists was a result of misunderstanding and medication. She uses this to segue into broader criticisms of political correctness, media, and the entertainment industry. Throughout the special, Barr doesn’t shy away from contentious subjects, including politics, gender, and her own mental health, often using self-deprecation as a tool for humor. She also touches on her life changes post-controversy, including her newfound residence in Texas, her experiences with COVID-19, and her views on the vaccination efforts. Roseanne continues to delve into various societal and personal topics, like the absurdity she sees in modern parenting, her disdain for certain celebrity behaviors, and her struggles with aging. Throughout the performance, Barr maintains a conversational and interactive rapport with the audience, responding to their reactions and occasionally engaging directly with individuals. Her act is punctuated by raucous laughter, cheers, and at times, boos, reflecting the divisive nature of her material. The special concludes with Roseanne encouraging her audience to be forthright with their feelings, delivering a final, defiant message of self-expression. Premiere date:\\xa0February 2nd, 2023, on Fox Nation. * * * [rock music] [audience cheers] Look at these fake nails. Woo-hoo, look at that! I’m about to go on. I’m praying to god that he lets my brains work for once, And he protects me from myself. Ha-ha, ha-ha. Crew: We’re on our mark and ready to go. Have a great show. Thank you very much. Crew: Good luck. Welcome back. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Roseanne Barr. [intense music] [audience cheers] Hey! Thank you! Thank you very much. Hi! Thank you! [audience erupts in cheers] It’s so great to be here because I was thinking about it. You know, I kind of started my whole career here in Houston. Audience: We love you! I love you, too. What a privilege it is for you to have me here this evening, Ladies and gentlemen. [audience laughter and cheers] And, of course, I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I really do. Are you guys having fun or are you here with your families? [audience laughs] Mm. So let me take a quick rally of the troops here. Where are my peeps that are going to get really offended if I do not offend everybody? Where are my peeps here? [audience erupts in cheers] Oh, boy, good, there you are. There you are. Don’t worry. I’m going to get them all tonight. [audience applauds] That’s right. Well, guess what? I moved here to Texas, too. Isn’t that crazy? [audience cheers] I really did. My son– I don’t know, he’s somewhere– my oldest son, he’s somewhere here, and all my whole family’s here and the whole deal. Where is he? My oldest son, my youngest son, my grandson, my godson, my family’s here. None of my daughters are here because they– They don’t agree with me politically. They’re libtards, so they didn’t show up. But, uh– [audience cheers] But now I moved to Texas, and it’s Just beautiful because it’s a red state, and I love that. And, two, it’s just beautiful. I bought a beautiful ranch and what beautiful tundra We have here in Texas. Like, I look out my bedroom window. I can’t believe it. I see all these gorgeous little tiny baby deer in my yard, eating the grass around my pool. It’s so fantastic, you know, because I can pull out my AR-15 and blow them just to smithereens legally. [audience cheers] So fantastic! Open carry, bitches! Hell, yeah! [audience erupts in cheers] Ha-ha, hell, yeah. Anyways, anybody else been fired recently? [audience cheers] Audience: Woo! Ooh, well, we’ll talk about that a little. Ahem. For the people that have been fired, were you able to keep your insurance? Audience: No! Audience: No! Yeah, it’s kind of scary. I– I was able to keep my insurance. Thank god. But then I started getting real– real nervous because my family, my sons and stuff, they’re looking at m',\n",
       "  'e weird, like, that maybe I’m worth more dead than alive, you know. I don’t know. I get kind of paranoid about it because I watch the ID channel. And what with my big mouth and everything, well, anyway, my two sons and my grandson and my godson, they’re all here kind of to watch over me, to make sure me and my big mouth don’t squander no more of their inheritance, I guess is what they’re here for. [audience applauds] Man, I had a rough couple of years there. I got fired because basically I racially misgendered somebody I thought was a white woman. [audience laughs] Audience: Woo! Audience: Bullshit. Huh? Audience: I thought that bitch was white. I know, I thought the bitch was white. It’s true! [audience cheers] They wouldn’t– they wouldn’t let me explain. I don’t– here it was Memorial Day, you know. And I was at my mom’s house in Salt Lake City, Utah, And it was memorial day. And I should say, I barely could sleep anymore because the network was running me ragged, making me do promos, which I hate. You know what I mean? I’d rather die than do effing promos, not the ones that Fox is asking me to do. [audience laughs] I’m more than happy to do those. But I could never sleep because they had me Go to New York, LA, New York. That’s why I couldn’t sleep. I’m an old woman, 68. So they told me, oh, try some Ambien, you know, so I did. I got on the Ambien on top of all my psycho drugs Because I’m crazy. I’ll just be honest. I’m completely crazy. [audience erupts in cheers] Oh, thank you. You are, too, I see. Thank you. No, but I’ve been on psycho meds and bipolar meds And antipsychotic drugs my whole damn life, right? It was no big deal to me. I shouldn’t have mixed it with Ambien and then topped it off with three beers, though. I have to admit. I should not have did that. That caused me to lose everything. And so what happened, it’s about 1:00 am. And I don’t have such good eyesight. You may have read about that, and Somebody sent across a picture. And it’s about 1:00 am there, and so I Captioned it and passed out. And then I woke up– [audience laughs] At 7:00 am, and the whole goddamn world was on fire. [audience laughs] My boyfriend came in there. He goes, oh, my god, it’s on cnn that your tweet was racist. I’m, like, what are you talking about, “my tweet was racist.” Muslim ain’t a race. [audience laughs] He goes, no, they’re saying she’s– She’s African-American. I was, like, oh, shit. [audience laughs] Oh, shit, no. “yeah, and ABC is on the phone. They want to talk to you.” I’m, like, oh, shit, I don’t want To talk to no Hillary donors. [audience laughs] After all I’ve been through on that show, you know, So I get on there. And the guy, you know, you can imagine. Oh, here’s how the phone call starts. (over-enunciating) “what possible– Excuse– Can you have– For the egregious– Thing you have done?” You know, and then just god and my upbringing comes in my head. And it’s, like, just tell the truth, Roseanne. You’ve always got to tell the truth, right? Tell the truth. The truth will set you free. You know what I’m talking about, ma’am? So I’m, like, you’re right, father. I’m just going to tell the truth. “I thought she’s white.” [audience laughs] It’s like total silence. [audience laughs] So I start tap dancing, you know as you do When you know you’re in shit. [audience laughs] I’m, like, hey, don’t do nothing to my show, ok? Don’t– don’t cancel me or do nothing to my show, fire me, nothing like that. I’ll tell you what. Just put me on “The Jimmy Kimmel Show” And on “The View” and a lot of your other shows You’ve got on the ABC channel, you know, where people, they’ve been in blackface and everything. I’ll go on there, and surely they’ll understand my mistake. [audience moans and cheers] Because surely they didn’t get fired for that shit. And they’ll understand when people Do something really stupid. And, uh, so, no, they said, “Well, Roseanne, we’ll have To see how the community”– That’s what he said– “we’ll have to see How the community reacts.” [audience boos] Yeah, and in my mind, I was thinking, what community. [audience laughs] The, uh, baby blood-drinking democrat community or, uh– [audience erupts in cheers] Or the protect Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and Prince Andrew community? Which community exactly are you talking about? [audience cheers] But I didn’t say it because, at that time, I was thinking it was more important to be nice. [audience laughs] So I walk in, and it’s on CNN that they’ve canceled my show just 20 minutes later. And not only that, but they killed my– they killed, uh, Roseanne. They killed her. [audience boos] Yeah. Yeah, I guess they thought they shut me up. But guess what? Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha, anyway– [audience erupts in cheers] Yeah, I didn’t really care at that time because I couldn’t sit in them writing rooms with those people one more second. I wasn’t re',\n",
       "  'ally that pissed what they did to me. But, you know, I was really mad what they did to my fans because they disrespected their own viewers, you know. [audience cheers] Like, we could have– we could have had her come on my show, and she could have read me the who’s it. And she could have dressed me down. We could have had a teachable moment that they’re all talking about. She could have come on. I could have had 15 times the ratings, And I could have learned something on behalf and shown something to America, which I always wanted to do that very thing anyway, bringing people together and learn about each other, right? When we have made mistakes for– Because we can learn. We can learn to get along for gods sake. [audience applauds] But, no, they didn’t want to do that, and that pissed me off. And that’s why I came back, even though I was, like, why would you want to do that after what they did. But I came back because I just– something’s wrong with me or something. I just– something’s in me. I just cannot let assholes win. I’m not. I’m not going to. [audience erupts in cheers] I’m not going to. [audience cheers] I am not going to let rich, privileged assholes win. I’m not! [audience erupts in cheers] And, you know, looking back, I believe that I actually Got fired because I delivered an audience– An unbelievable audience of 28 million people to a show that had a trump hater and a Hillary hater still loving each other, still living under the same roof as a family, still being American. And, by god, they hated that! [audience cheers] But whatever, it’s all in the past now. It was a weird– It’s been, like, five years or something. It was a weird five years. We’ve all been through some shit in the last five years, right, the whole country. We’ve all been through some shit in the last five years. Well, imagine my surprise when my agent called and said Fox Nation was offering me a big contract to do a stand-up special. Imagine my shock. [audience erupts in cheers] I was shocked. I was happy but shocked. They sent along a contract and said, hey, we want you to do an hour or so of material but no racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, anti-semitism. I go, well, there goes my whole fucking act. What– what? [audience applauds] And they said and we want you to do very few swear words as well. [audience laughs] But that– that– the f-word I just used, ladies and gentlemen, is one of three times tonight I will be using the f-word because my lawyers were able to go in and wrangle a three f-word deal out of the Fox Nation’s lawyers. [audience laughs] And I accepted because it’s kind of a challenge for me. I’ve never done an hour of comedy before with only using the f-word three times. I thought, hey, this is a chance to try something new. [audience laughs] Never done it before so. Audience: We love you! I love you. You’re sweet. [audience cheers] Thank you so much for coming to see me tonight. Any Jews here tonight? [audience cheers] Wow, a lot of Jews, that’s pretty amazing. Hi. Hi, Jewish people. There’s probably a lot more Jews, But they’re kind of ashamed to raise their hand. [audience laughs] Yeah, I don’t blame you. I’m lucky. Nobody ever thinks I’m Jewish because I’m from Utah. Audience: No more bitches with stitches. We all get to open our mouths. Huh? Audience: No more bitches with stitches. We get to open our mouths. That’s right. We do but shut up, bitch. But, anyway– [audience erupts in cheers] I mean– I mean– I mean, right on, sisterhood. But, anyway, no, but, no, it’s kind of embarrassing to be a jew. And I would like to take this opportunity to kind of apologize to the gentile nations for the Jewish people. Like, you know, like, Epstein, Weinstein, and all these here. Sorry. I am a jew, and people don’t think I’m Jewish because I’m not from the East Coast or nothing. I’m from Salt Lake City, Utah. Audience: Woo! Any Mormons here? Audience: Yes! Hi, Mormons. Love ya. I grew up with Mormons. That was a weird place to be Jewish, though, Salt Lake City, Utah. Boy, my family, we stuck out like a sore thumb there in Mormon Utah, you know, because we only had the one mother, and so that was weird. [audience laughs] She had to do all the mothering by herself. That was kind of rough on her. And my mother was the most beautiful Jewish woman In the Jewish community. That’s what everybody said all the time. They were, like, she looked like Elizabeth Taylor. That’s what everybody said, and she had a gorgeous figure, you know, my mother. And she managed to snare the one Jewish football hero at West Side High School, which was my daddy. He was a football hero there. He played center at West Side High, and he was a big old football hero. And they called him Jerry Barr, the boy built like a barrel. [audience laughs] So they were quite a couple. And they had me and guess whose body I inherited. [aud',\n",
       "  'ience laughs] Not my mother’s but my dad, the body built like a barrel, With no waist and no ass cheeks whatsoever. It’s very sad, very sad for a girl. I had no ass whatsoever. I’m telling you the truth. Just a crack in my back is basically what I had. It’s very sad for my– nobody wanted to date me. Plus, my mother and father were very concerned that I would never find a husband because I was fat and had a bad attitude and a big mouth. I mean, they were really– [audience laughs] They were really overly concerned about that I’d never get a husband. That was my whole life. You’re never going to get a husband Unless you go on a diet. I mean, no guy is ever going to want to marry you, What, with you having no tuchus– That’s what they’d say– no hips, no buttocks, no waist, and a big mouth. And you’re always in trouble, and you’re really fat, You know, and nobody likes that kind of thing, you see. So you’ve got to go on this. They put me on so many diets, the rice Diet, the birdseed diet. They put me on every damn diet, and none of them worked. Finally, my mom said she’s going to– she finally got a guy for me to date, and I was suspicious Right away. She’s, like, I found a wonderful gentleman– She called him– in the Jewish community That I think you’ll be– You’ll be happy to know is interested in dating you. So right away, I’m suspicious, right? So she goes, so I don’t know if this rings true for any of you. Probably not because it’s a whole different culture, I know. But the first thing that went in my mind is– I don’t know if this happened to you, if this is familiar– is, like, “um, mom, we’re not related to him, are we?” [audience laughs] Does that ring true for any of y’all? Audience: Yeah. And by the way, she answered– because it took Her a long time to answer– I knew that we were related, you know. And it was Stu Bernstein, that big fat guy, that big fat slob Of the Bernstein family. And all of them had eyes that went like this, Wah-wah, wah-wah, wah-wah. The whole family’s eyes, wah-wah, wah-wah, they never Stood still, none of their eyes, you know. And they were fat, not that I should say Nothing about fat but the eyes. And, plus, he’s a chronic masturbator, Which I guess he thought– He thought we didn’t see it or nothing. The guy, he thought he was disguising it, but I knew what he’s up to, you know. He’d go like this. “well, let’s all go down to the Dairy Queen there and get ourself an ice cream.” [audience laughs] “what do you say?” Sitting there on the couch or standing up, whatever, It’s always, like, “well, let’s go over to Safeway There and pick ourself up”– I knew what he was doing. So I’m, like, no, I’m not. I’m not, you know. [audience laughs] So she said, “Well, you’ve got to go on a diet Then if you want to.” So she took me to this diet guy. This is, I swear to god, true on my kids’ lives. I’m 16, and I’m fat. So we’re out there. We’re waiting in the waiting room. And she waits till the last minute, my mom, to tell me, “Oh, Roseanne, by the way, the doctor is blind”– [audience laughs] –“and how he tells how much weight you need to lose is by feeling your body.” [audience laughs] I swear to god. So I’m in shock. So we go in there, and he rolls over In a wheelchair because not only is he blind But he can’t walk neither. He’s a mess, nothing but mess. And he rolls over there and starts going like this. “mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, oh, mm-hmm.” And he does my boobs, too. “mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I’d say there’s about 40 pounds of you That you need to release.” “Thanks, doctor.” So he fixes it up that I go in there every day– I swear to god this is true– and I get a shot of urine from a pregnant horse. Have any of y’all heard of that? Urine from a pregnant horse, well, it makes your what’s-it speed up. What’s that, son? Audience: Metabolism. Your metabolism speed up, so you start losing weight, and I did. I lost a ton of weight. I lost so much weight that I got pregnant by the neighbor guy, so that was good. [audience cheers] Anyway, that’s another sad story. But, yeah, I was kind of cute at that time, then I left home. I had all these fantasies living at home there, living at home Where I was just, you know, my mom’s Ugly daughter that stood in the corner chewing on my hair. But, uh, I don’t know what I’m talking about. Oh, yeah, so I was kind of a loner. I had all these fantasies. I didn’t have no friends or nothing, mostly in my room, living in my imagination. Number one, I wanted to grow up, leave Utah, of course. Two, I wanted to get out there and get my pork on because we were not allowed to have any pork in my house. I wanted to move away, so I could take birth control pills so that I would be able to have indiscriminate sex With everyone– every guy I ever met– and to get my own show, named “The Roseanne Show.” And I’m so proud to say that I was ',\n",
       "  'able to make all of those dreams come true, ladies and gentlemen. [audience erupts in cheers] Thank you for the validation. [audience cheers] But, anyway, due to the spam and my love of spam, which has never subsided, I think that’s a large reason for why I moved to Hawaii, which I still live in Hawaii. Now I’m, like, half Hawaii, half Texas, which is cool. [audience cheers] I love Hawaii. It’s a fantastic place. But one thing we say over there, it is quite a short trip from Aloha to a-hole. It’s quite a short trip sometimes over there. And, yeah, yeah, spam, that evens it all out. You probably read about me having macular degeneration and losing my eyesight and all that, right? So the fact of it is I could grow weed over there in Hawaii, And that really helps me with my eyesight things, right? [audience cheers] It is such a good medication, and that’s another thing. When I ran for president, I ran on legalization of marijuana Because it’s a good, good drug. [audience erupts in cheers] Right? It really helps you if you have anxiety issues, which I do, Because I get very anxious when I think I might run out of pot. So it’s a very good treatment for that kind of thing. And you know what? The marijuana, it does help me with my driving Since I can’t see too good. And, well, I probably shouldn’t even drive is the bottom line There since I can’t see. And, yes, it’s true. I have hit a few people. But, you know, luckily, I was not hurt, so it all worked out. But– but one day, my kids were coming over, And I haven’t really talked about my kids too much. I have five of them. And, you know, my kids are probably like your kids. They’re ungrateful, privileged, little fucking bastards That have never had to work a day in their life for anything. [audience cheers] You know, and they’re too good for cheese. My kids are too damn good for regular cheese. So I was going over there to the health food store to get them this soy cheese because they’re too good for real cheese, you see. So, anyway, I move on. I go over there, and I pull in. And some lady is sitting in her car, looking over at me. And I had a couple of shots before I came to the store, you know, to help me with my focus and this and that. And she looks over, and I’m, like, ah, god, I’m going to have to act like I’m nice because she probably recognized me or some shit. So now I’m acting like I’m nice, which I do all the time. It’s the least I can do. [chuckles] [audience laughs] [audience cheers] So she looks over at me, and she’s, like, you– you hit me. You hit me with your car, your fender. I’m, like, I didn’t hit you, bitch. What are you talking about? This is a Tesla. If I was going to hit you, it would have made some kind of a beeping noise, you know, that Tesla is prepared for hitting things, and it warns you. I didn’t hit you, you crazy bitch. And I said, you know what you’re doing? You just know I’m in show business, so you smell some money. That’s what you’re doing, right? Do you see where I’m going with this? A lot of people are like that. I go, you smell money because I’m in show business. You thought you can start some shit with me, and I have to give you a settlement. And that’s what you’re doing. You’re not the first, and you’re probably not going to be the last. She goes, “That is not true, Roseanne. I’ll have you know”– [audience cheers] She goes, “I will have you know that I am also in show business, ok? The last 24 years, I was Bette Midler’s dresser. I’ll have you know that.” [audience laughs] I’m, like, “Yeah, well, blowing cocaine up Bette Midler’s asshole is not show business, is it?” [audience cheers] Then she moves in for the kill. “I think you’re driving around drunk, Roseanne.” I said, “I’ll have you know, I am an actress, and I know how to maintain. You are an anti-semite. That’s what’s wrong with you,” because that’s what we Jews do when we’re losing an argument, right? “you are an anti-semite.” [audience cheers] She goes, “My name is Goldberg.” I’m, like, “Well, then I’m an anti-semite.” [audience applauds] And I sped away in my Tesla home. When I went in, I noticed the front fender was all smashed in. [audience laughs] Ooh, uh-oh. Can you believe that it has been two or three years since we was all in the quarantine? Can you believe back that far? I’m glad you’re out. I’m glad we can come out. [audience cheers] What about all that quarantine? Remember all that? You know, I figured out q, q, it stands for quarantine. It wasn’t any of that who’s going to get arrested bullshit. It stands for quarantine. Q, the great awakening, you know why? Because you had to be with your goddamn family in the house, and you couldn’t get out of there. You couldn’t go to the gym. You couldn’t go to a restaurant. You couldn’t get away. You couldn’t go to nobody else’s house. You were stuck there in the shit with your friggin’ famil',\n",
       "  'y and couldn’t get away. That’s why they say the great awakening. You had to deal with that shit, and you couldn’t run anymore. [audience laughs] Dang. I was smoking a lot of cigarettes at the beginning of the quarantine there. After getting fired, I started smoking again, And I love to smoke. But my kids ganged up on me. They’re, like, “You better quit smoking, mom, because you’re going to get COVID. And then you’re going to have to go to the hospital, and they’ll put them things down your throat and kill you, like they do in New York. You better quit smoking.” So I did quit smoking. And you know what happened soon as I quit smoking? Soon as I quit, I got the COVID the minute I quit smoking. And then I read that cigarette smoking actually protects you from getting the COVID. That’s when I knew everything was bullshit. [audience cheers] It’s all bullshit and nothing but lies, every single damn thing. [audience cheers] I’ve had the COVID four times now, and I lost all my taste. I have no taste and no smell either all this time. But I look at it like it’s a silver lining in the COVID cloud because I don’t eat so much. I’m not wanting to eat everything, And it don’t taste that good so I lost some weight. Thanks, lord. [audience laughs] Once I got the COVID, though, and saw that my kids weren’t going to come over, I was, like, man, I’m going to get the long COVID. [audience laughs] I’m going to get that COVID that never quits. Woo, it’s wonderful. It’s like living in a rest home is what it was like there. I had an assistant that cooked for me and brought me tea, And none of my family ever came over. Oh, my god, it was so great. It was the first time in my life that I haven’t had to take care of nobody’s kids or do their goddamn laundry Or get out of bed and do shopping for or any of that shit. I just laid there in bed talking to god and writing jokes. It was fantastic. [audience erupts in cheers] I did not want my grandkids coming over, ’cause they’re always sick. And they make me sick all the time. My daughter thinks it’s good that they’re sick. Your mom thinks it’s good that the kids are sick. It would always drive me nuts. She goes, it’s good they’re sick because they’re developing Their anti– What do you call it? [audience shouting] Yeah, their immunity. They’re getting their immunities. It’s good that they’re sick. Yeah, well, I’m 70. What about my immunities, bitch? You bring over these kids with the green snot in their nose, And it takes me a month to get over it. Stay home. I’ll watch them on Facetime. Right? It was so much better. It was just great. How many yous got the vax? [laughs] [clapping] A few of yous. You probably had to get it, right? Were you forced to get the vax? Yeah. Boy, what a– that makes me mad, they Forced people to get the vax. I hope they have to pay for that, what they did to us. Woman: Yeah! Did you get any of that myocarditis, Or the facial paralysis, or, you know, The adult dropping dead syndrome or any of that shit? Get any of that? What happened to people that they start believing, For some reason, that this government had their best interest at heart? Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! What? What? My whole family’s bunch of libtards, you know, as I said. And they called me a conspiracy theorist the whole time, But everything I said turned out to be true. Did they apologize? Hell no! They never apologize. Never admit they’re wrong, do they? Now, my whole family is sick, what with blood clots and this And that and the other. They’re all sick. I’m the only healthy one. I’m gonna miss ’em! [audience laughter] What happened to people, though? How could they line up to take these shots From this government, knowing that this government gave Smallpox-infested blankets to the first nations people, Gave syphilis to black prisoners in Tuskegee, Told us there was weapons of mass destruction Before they leveled Iraq and destroyed Libya, told us fen-phen was safe and then all The fucking fat people died? What happened? And they’re like, hey, can I get that booster? Can I get that shot in those 15 boosters? Would you mind giving my daughter here That shot right in her eyeball after she’s born? Could you give her 10 of those right in the eyeball? Could you give her a shot right in her little baby clitoris? Could you do that for me, Mr. Biden? What’s wrong with people? What’s wrong with them? These young pink pussy hat wearers, They want to be lied to. They want to be lied to because they are so used to it. You can’t wake them up, because you can’t wake up people that Are pretending to be asleep. That’s what I figure. Nobody– [audience cheers and applauds] Nobody in their lives has ever cared enough to tell them The damn truth. It’s our fault, us baby boomers. We ruin their lives. We lied to them all away. We lie to women, ruin their lives. For example, my',\n",
       "  ' son, he’s 27 years old. I’m very proud of him. He’s the only one of my children who ever went to college And graduated. I couldn’t be more proud. [audience cheers] But what does he do with it? Just sits there in my office, took over my office. I can’t even walk in my office, what With the empty beer cans and the dirty socks. And all he does is sit there playing video games all night long every night. “Call of Duty.” What’s that other one? Audience: “Fortnite.” “Fortnite,” “Call of Duty.” And what’s that other one? [audience shouting] “Grand Theft Auto.” That’s his whole life, for god’s sake, Sitting there, asking me stupid questions I have no idea how to answer. Who’s my real father? What am I supposed to say about things like that? I mean, these people, they have no concept of reality. They’ve been living in a bubble forever, Asking questions that have nothing To do with the real world. What is my gender? Mom, what is my gender? Your gender is, get a job. That’s your gender. What are they thinking? Ask, what is a woman? They don’t know that? But when they’re asking all the time, what is a woman? I’ll tell you what a woman is, a woman is me! [audience cheers] That’s what a woman is, ok? A woman is someone who cleans up everybody else’s shit! That’s what a woman is. A woman is somebody whose boobs hang down to her knees With a prolapsed uterus from giving birth to five Ungrateful little privileged bastards that Have never had to work for anything In their whole damn lives! [audience cheers] [laughs] My pronouns are kiss my ass! [audience cheers] And I just want to say to all those girls That are all so damn upset about them Overturning the “Roe v Wade” thing, don’t get so damn upset about it! You are never gonna get pregnant. You’ve got the vax! You’re never gonna have a baby. Chill out! Yeah. I do have a message for today’s women. I’m trying to get a Kleenex out of this pocket. There it is. I do have a message for today’s women. I think it’s important. Women, keep your penis in your pants. There’s no excuse for this kind of behavior. In this day and age, take some responsibility For your own actions, women. These #metoo whores, they are so on my last nerve. You know what I mean? If you are gonna go to a Disney producer’s room at 3:00 am, Are you kidding me? Then you’re not gonna turn around and cry about it And try to get some money out of it. You’re not. The world has changed a lot since I was alive. I’m telling you, it’s changed so much. When I was young, we gals used to go to parties hoping to get Drunk so we’d wake up pulling a train of five guys just For fun. And nobody thought anything about it. It was no big deal. You know what I mean? Remember when you were young and you got molested? It is your fault. Remember that? Remember? My mom’s like, didn’t I tell you not to go around old Joe when he comes to the corner on his bike? I told you to stay away from him. You know what he does to the young girls. And there you are, running up there to the corner, Knowing what he is going to do to you, And then you complain about it. He buys us ice cream! We didn’t do yoga stretches. Do you know what I mean? We didn’t drink caramel pumpkin latte “mah-chi-ah-to,” White woman caramel drinks. We didn’t do that. We drank tab and fresca and shit that had saccharin in it. They gave us liver cancer, and we were happy to have it, ’cause we were tough, unlike you people, you young people. Privileged. Just privileged. That’s what I realized in quarantine. Privilege really kills. Privilege is what ruins lives, when You start thinking, you know, that the world Needs to be pretty for you. Well, it don’t. Right? Just because you got a degree in gender studies, That don’t mean shit. You’re not gonna get a job no place. You can’t even get a job at Whole Ho Ho’s donuts. Didn’t I tell you that? I told you. Privilege kills and bliss is ignorance. I turn those around. Bliss is ignorance, right? I have three different litters of children. Oh, I say that. I had three different litters with three different men Because I’m a whore. You know what I mean, ladies. And parenting has changed so much, too, since, you know, back in my day. It’s changed so much. Who else has teenagers in their 50s? Yeah, I have three daughters. I told you they’re very liberal, but they’re In their late 40s and 50. Three daughters in menopause. That’s when you know you’re old. For god’s sake, that’s when you know you’re old, right? I can’t believe how fast it went, too. Oh, my god. They tell me, you know, the things they come up with now. They’re like, mom, the doctor, they want us to take Testosterone for our symptoms. They are trying to give everybody crazy ass hormones From the time they’re two all the way up, Giving women testosterone to treat Their perimenopause is insane. I’m like, great. Now you’ll be lifting weights and watching ',\n",
       "  'football. I wouldn’t take it if I was you. That’s just asking for trouble, you know, Because your IQ is gonna decrease by half. And then you’re gonna just start peeing on toilet seats For no good reason whatsoever. It’s just, I don’t think it’s– I don’t think it’s good. But I kind of think maybe I shouldn’t have left the democrat party so early, what with their full-term abortion stuff they’re doing these days. Because I’m thinking, hey, another couple of months, They’re probably gonna move right into, I’d be able to abort these bitches by the time they’re 50. I bet they’re gonna move right into it. You know, I mean, it’s coming. That’d be cool. So things aren’t what they seem. Like, my brother and my sister are both gay. I’ve mentioned that before. And both of them are married to their gay partners That they’ve both been with for 34 and 35 years, which is Pretty amazing, considering– [audience cheers] Yeah. It’s great. They’ve raised children. And you know, I’m heterosexual and I’ve been married 9 or 10 Times, so you can’t ever be– You know, go with the stereotype for things. But they’re progressive parents, though, And I can’t stand that, progressive parents. I can’t stand it. It don’t make any sense, you know, the way they just let Their kids get away with shit. They just, like a rubber band, stretch it to the end. You know? My sister, she never quite puts the hammer down on her. She has twin lesbian daughters that are– That’s what I call them. They’re not really lesbians. But they’re, like, 21. She never really put the hammer down. They could get away with anything, you know? Not like my kids. I really– you know, I’m there, on top of my kids. My kids can’t get away with anything that I know about. But yeah. She’s like, I’m going to count to five, Like that some big threat. You know? Woman: Yeah. [laughs] You know, I mean, that progressive. 1, 2, 3? I’m like, you’ve got to hit these bitches! If you want them to do right, you’ve got to hit ’em. You’ve got to hit your kids. I have to say that. We need to hit ’em more. And why has it fallen to me to be The person to have to hit everybody’s Kids in the grocery store? Why has that fallen to me? But there they are in the grocery store. Their mom will pay no attention to them because she’s too busy photographing her ass– [audience laughter] –For her Instagram page, where the kids are running wild. It just really gets me. It’s like, why did you have them? Now I’m, like, kind of on a bender about it. So of course, I’m gonna hit ’em. You know, I’m gonna have to. Somebody has to. What are you gonna do, go over there? Hey, stop doing that. That ain’t right. Didn’t your mother tell you that? Keep your hands off stuff, and don’t stick your nasty fingers Through the plastic. Do you understand me? And I’m like, ma’am? Ma’am? Did it ever occur to you when you had these little bastards That you were gonna bring them to a public place Where other people would have to care for them while you Took pictures of your ass? It just gets me. It really gets me, as I’m jealous of anyone who Has an ass, well, first of all, because I Was born ass-less in an ass-based economy And I’m bitter about it. I never thought I would see the day when a woman goes into her husband and says, Honey, do these pants make my ass look fat enough? There’s no men left in our country. Have you noticed that? All the men, they want to be women, Or else they’re just complete pussies and losers. Have you noticed that? There’s no men with any kind of spine left. They’ve all been beaten down. What happened to the men? Are there any men here tonight who would define their self? [audience cheers] Oh, sure. Really? Ok. Well, let’s take this little test. You think you’re a man, huh? You think you’re strong, yeah? Mr. Man, well, let’s see. I defy any of you men who say you’re strong and manly And this and that. Well, I defy you to go home tonight and tell Your wife or girlfriend that she needs To sit down and shut her yap. Tell her you need to sit down and shut Up and get off every other woman in the world’s case. Stop bitching about every other woman And trying to stir up shit for them. Close your mouth and make me a sandwich. Things would be a lot better. Am I right? And I bet none of yous will do it, either. None of yous will do it because you’re scared shitless. I know it. Women are– I don’t know. Something has happened to women, and they’re just All completely brainwashed. We’ll do anything for dick, anything for dick. What happened? We used to like freedom and liberty and this and that And being independent. Now, it’s anything for dick, putting plastic in your boobs, In your butt, in your calves, your eyes, your cheeks, Just to get some guy to get, what, an erection around you, For god’s sake? Dancing around erect phalluses? That’s your whole world, for god’s sake, now? You’re dick-mo',\n",
       "  '-tized. You’re dick-tarted, for Christ’s sake? What is that about? You’re on hormones. Wake up. They’ve got all the women on the hormones because– This is what they told me. Roseanne, unfortunately, the only thing thin on you Is your vaginal walls, and so you need to get on hormones so That they’ll plump up and you’ll be able to enjoy Sex with your boyfriend. What? Those days are over! It– it’s just over. You shouldn’t even– right? You people don’t agree with me. Who’s older than me? Who’s older than 70? Kathy: Yeah! How old are you? Kathy: 71. 71. What’s your name? Kathy: Kathy. Kathy? So you’re a big sex fiend. You’re 71 and you’re a big sex fiend? Is that what you’re saying? Kathy: Not at all! Oh, you are– You identify with me, that we ought to be over all this? Is that what you’re saying? Absolutely! I love you, girl! You got a working brain there. Good. I’m glad. Now, how many of you women are trying to plump up Your vaginal wall so you can have sex with a guy You have lived with for 15 years and are sick of? I’d like to know that. [audience laughs] Woman: Yes, that’s for certain! Woman: Whoo! Woman: Shit. Well, anyway, I’m old, like I said. And I was thinking about, a lot of people have a bucket list. You know? I don’t really want to bungee jump off the Eiffel Tower or any of that shit. I got a fuck it list. Yeah, stuff I want to stop doing before I Kick the breathing habit. It’s way easier, you know, to stop doing. Like, one thing I’m gonna do is, I’m going to stop pretending To be interested when old people pull out Pictures of their grandkids. You know? Like, put that shit away. That kid looks like an albino monkey in braces. Put that shit away. I’m never going to nobody’s wedding if they’ve been married more than three times. It’s like, let me know if you’re still together After seven or so years, and I’ll send you A toaster or something, whore. I’m not gonna listen when old people start griping About their medical issues. That really bum– god, that makes me mad. Well, Roseanne, you know, I’ve got the sciatica and the fibromyalgia Going this way and that, meeting up here at the waist, going down my leg here. And it’s really painful, and I can barely– Oh, I had to go to the doctor the other day Because I could barely bend over and move there, is all. Hey, why don’t you do me a favor and just die, already? Ok? ’cause I’m their friend, I’ll put in an appearance at your funeral, But I just don’t have time for this shit now. Another thing, I’m not gonna be nice to those Jehovah’s Wit-less people that come over there, knocking on my door, Asking me where I plan on spending eternity. I’m gonna say, come on in! Come on. But you got to take your pants off ’cause it’s satan’s birthday! And last but not least, I’m never going on another date with Bill Cosby. You can believe me. Never. My back hurt after that. Well, another thing in the quarantine, Is that I was getting in touch with my psychic abilities While I was there, all by myself there. And so I know there’s probably some yous here that wants me to do a psychic reading for you While we’re all here together. Woman: Yeah! If you’ve got a question about your future– And it needs to be a real question, You know, thought out. I’ll give you a minute. A real question regarding your future. You might be very, very surprised at how accurate I am And how psychic, how very, very psychic I am. Ok. Is there anybody who wants me to answer their psychic– Man: Me! Yes, over here, sir. Uh-huh. Oh. No, you’re still gonna have to fuck her. I’m sorry to say it. Sorry. I’m sorry to say that. Why, I said it already five times, didn’t I? I failed. Sorry, sir. You’re still gonna have to have sex with her, So you won’t be getting lucky. Yes, ma’am? Will you get married? Do you have somebody you’re engaged to? And do you know anybody you want to marry?

Let me know how that works out. You, sir, in the blue. You’ve been losing weight and you Wonder if you’ll get back to wearing Your size 42 suit again? Yes, you will, sir. They’ll bury you in it. [audience laughs] You’re welcome. But yeah. A tour in my future? I do. They were talking to me about it and I said, yeah, I think so. You know, I feel pretty good.',\n",
       "  ' I feel pretty good. You know, I might do a tour. Right? [audience cheers] ‘Cause I think that I’m spreading the love, you know? I think that I’m helpful with getting People to spread the love. You know what I mean? Like, right now, I have a very good suggestion for all My fans and all y’all here. I love you so much. Now, a lot of us are on antidepressants. And we’re very depressed and this and that Over the quarantine and the fact of what they’ve done to us, What we’ve just lived through. But I found a way, drug-free, alcohol-free, To be able to lift my own spirits, And I want to pass it on to you. And it really, really works, too. Now, what it is– What I do is, I write suicide notes to everyone in my family, Blaming them for my death. And it really helps. I mean, it really lifts me up in my spirits. You know, it really, really does. It’s so wonderful. “dear mom, remember those party dresses you sewed for me And forced me to wear to third grade Because you said they were slender-izing, The ones with the hoop skirts that I couldn’t lift up fast Enough or push out of the way on the potty, Causing me to pee on the back of them And then to be laughed at by all the other students The entire day? Well, now it seems that I’ve killed myself, And I just want you to know that you’re to blame. [audience laughs] Had you been a better mother or seamstress, I might be taking those western swing dancing classes with you and your new boyfriend, Arnie, right now. But instead, I’m stepping cold and hanging in the closet Like that goddamn dress. Thanks, mom!” [applause] It’s just– it’s just amazing how it’s lifting. “dear daughter, when you called me a racist simply Because I told you that your boyfriend was An unemployed, crack-smoking Mexican fellow, that in no way meant that I don’t love the Mexican people themselves, As I do. As I pointed out to you, you could have picked A Mexican gentleman who didn’t smoke crack, had a job, and no facial tattoos, and I would have celebrated with you. But now, I’m rolled up in the dirt like a burrito, And it’s your fault I’m dead. Hasta la vista, baby.” And something that really, really pisses me off here. “dear McDonald’s, your refusal to offer the McRib sandwich Year-round–” Because you never know when it’s gonna come back, do you? You think they could afford some kind of advertising plan Where they’d say, the McRib that comes on July 4th. July is the time for the McRib. Or they could go, Christmas is for the McRib or just anything. But no, they never tell us when it’s gonna come back, do they? So we can’t plan our lives or anything. “dear McDonald’s, refusal to offer the McRib sandwich Year-round has left me with no other choice Than to wash down a fistful of Vicodin with a jumbo bottle of vodka from Costco. Because you, sirs, have barbecue sauce as well as my blood On your hands. And I’m loving it!” [audience laughs] [applause] And finally, “dear abc–” [audience laughs] Oh. [audience cheers] But as I was watching the ID channel, This commercial came on, you know. And it goes, “sometimes suicide is misplaced homicide.” And then I was like, hey. That gives me a whole new idea. What the hell here? “dear ABC, when you asked me, once again, to come back And bail out your shit, low-rated network, I did so with the same sass and vigor That I’ve always delivered, and I gave you the highest ratings You’ve seen in 10 years. Unfortunately, network executives Are not what they used to be. It was your bright idea to kill off my character And throw me under every bus that you could find. Well, guess what? I’m not the one that’s dead, bitches.” [audience cheers] Ladies and gentlemen, my final message of the evening. Don’t wait till it’s too late to tell the people you love How you really feel about them. I think that’s the message I really want to give to you all. Tonight, go home tell those you love to fuck off right now. [audience cheers] Thank you for coming. Thank you. [audience cheers] Love you. Thank you so much.

He explores the serious issues of identity, conflict, and suffering in Palestine, labeling the situation as genocide and advocating for peaceful resolutions and understanding. Obeid reflects on the challenges of discussing such sensitive topics through comedy, emphasizing the importance of unity and recognizing the resilience of the Palestinian people amidst ongoing strife and division. Published on YouTube, November 12, 2023 * * * First of all, I think America doesn’t know a lot about Palestinian people, and that’s probably because America needs someone famous from a group to know about a race, right? And you think, like, who are famous Palestinians? Nobody really knows them. You have like Yasser Arafat and ',\n",

But, uh, isn’t that crazy though? The two most famous Palestinians in history are Jesus and DJ Khaled. They’re very similar when you think about it. Jesus and DJ Khaled. In fact, when they came out with the New Testament, they were like, “Another one!” I know a lot of people do get upset with that joke because I say Jesus was Palestinian. A couple of things about this, okay: First of all, the name uh, Palestine, traces back to a root that goes before Jesus’s time. In fact, Syria Palestina was what the Romans and Greeks called the broader area, so it was a term that existed. But Jesus specifically was born in Judea, and he was ethnically Jewish, but he was born in the land that is now Palestine because Bethlehem is in the West Bank of Palestine. So, if someon',\n",

Jesus was Jewish and Palestinian; he was the solution to the Middle East in one person. Yeah, this isn’t a sermon, don’t worry. I’m just saying. I’m just saying. We know Jesus was Jewish because he didn’t celebrate the Christian holidays, right? He didn’t do Christmas. He really didn’t like Easter, definitely did not do Easter. Every Christmas Eve, he’d be at a Chinese restaurant, locally like, he was for sure Jewish. And we know Jesus was Palestinian ’cause he broke out of a cave in a matter of 3 days. That requires a tunnel. We know this. Jesus was Jewish and Palestinian, and black, for sure. He was black. It is nice that America’s finally waking up and becoming aware of how serious this issue and how this issue affects all of us. Watching everything fall apart',\n",
       "  ' in the last few weeks has been extremely disheartening. I know I come off as like, you know, I know how to put on a game face for shows, but I’ve been really depressed. There are people right now who are suffering a deeply tragic situation. People are being killed right now, and we are not over there; we are here in the first world. So, I think it is important for us to remember that we should not be the ones adding fuel to the fire. We should be helping. We should be stopping this madness. That’s my opinion, okay? Um, but the Palestinians are going through right now is, by definition, a genocide. You can get upset with that if you want, but a lot of people are like, “Oh, you’re changing the definition of genocide.” No, you didn’t know what the definition of genocide was. You have to look it up. It turns out there’s been a lot of genocides that you didn’t think about because that’s the definition of genocide. Here’s the positi',\n",

It’s like, uh, have you heard of Ramadan? They’ve been training for this their whole lives. You’re messing with the wrong folks. This just brings them closer to God. Can you imagine if the people who controlled America’s water and food cut off our water and food? We’d be storming the Capitol tomorrow. We’d be eating each other on day three; the vegans would go first. You’d have like 10 January 6 at the Capitol. We’d be eating Nancy Pelosi right in front of her.

There’s a lot of propaganda going on right now that’s trying to destroy the character of a lot of different people and divide us all. You have to understand there’s propaganda that’s making Arabs look bad; it’s a full-on smear campaign against Arabs and the same thing for Jewish people too, a shmear campaign. Um, if you’re Arab, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Jewish, you need to know that we are being divided and we are being torn apart by fucking warlords right now. This is not us; this is not reflective of our people, of our histories.

Be on the team of not choosing genocide. That’s all the basic premise is: don’t choose the genocide. Mathematically, the land is to be shared, not taken. I wrote that myself when I was high.

People are always going to get offended by one thing you might say, and then there’s the other camp of people who are like, “You didn’t go hard enough.” Somebody asked me, “Why don’t you make jokes about Israel?” I usually say Palestine because you can often get in trouble for criticizing Israel. That’s the other thing too; people aren’t pronouncing the names right. That’s a really annoying thing. I heard somebody call it Palestine, like this is in Ohio, bro, like. I heard somebody call it Gaza, like no, no, it’s Gaza, or if you’re Arab, say Gaza. Yeah, or Israeli, say Hamas. Hamas, even Israel too, Israel too.

The reason I don’t make fun of the Israeli military is that I’ve tried before, and it’s failed. I posted a joke about the Israeli military, and everybody hated it. Even Palestinians were like, “Take it down,” so I did. I listened to the people. I didn’t give up. I tried again. I posted another joke about the Israeli military, and people were like, “Don’t quit your day job,” which hurts ’cause I don’t have a day job, so I took it down.

       " ['Girls and boys, please welcome to the stage. Sarah Silverman! Hi. Well, thank you. Thank you so much. I am so happy you guys are here. I’m sorry about the metal detectors. That is my bad. I, um… Tweeted something, and, uh, it made some people feel the need to express, um, wanting to kill me. And… I’m sorry I called for a military coup. I knew it was a long shot. You know, when you’re a comedian now, you really have to think things through before you post them, you know, on Twitter. Who do we think we are, presidents? Oh. Not necessary. But appreciated. I’m, uh… I’m not a fancy person. I don’t, um… You know, I’m wearing a onesie. I’m not… I have friends that love jewelry, and I love them. But I… I don’t really understand the value of jewelry at all. That said… I love a nice hotel room. I need a soaking tub. So, I have my things. And I was just on the road, and I got to stay in some really nice hotels. And, um, I’ll never complain, because I’m so afraid of being, like, a complaining Jew. Which is a stereotype. Based on facts and patterns. And then, like, deducing from those patterns. Why are you selling out your culture, Sarah? Sorry. Did it get a laugh? Yes. Okay. Um… But I did call down. And I was like, “Everything is so amazing.” Thank you so much. Um, but I… noticed there seems to be, um… semen on the… I think it’s called a duvet. And… Or a comforter. And also, um… There’s also some on, like, the nightstand. And, um, also, I noticed there’s come all over my tits. It’s… I’m sorry. I just, you know, if there’s a… I hate to complain. If there’s an upgrade to be had, I would… “in I’d take it.” Can you hear me when I just talk like this? This is a good sound system. You can hear me when I just talk like this? I, uh, got laser hair removal. And… Did you just applaud that? You’re like, “Finally.” I got laser hair removal. I waited a really long time to do it. Uh… I wanted the science to be at its peak. You know, like, we landed on Mars… I think it was August 2012. Are you just impressed that I remember the date? What I’m saying is… we landed on Mars in 2012. I waited four more years. And then I looked up the highest-rated laser hair removal place within three blocks of my apartment. And I went there. It was called LaserAway. And, um… it wasn’t what I… I think I was naive, and I just thought you go, and you get… And your hair gets removed. But it’s a much longer process. For every section of hair you want removed, you have to go have eight separate sessions, you know, like on each… So, for me, I was doing, like, from right below my belly button down to the floor. And then back up to about the middle of my back. And, um… Isn’t that funny that that’s funny? And it’s a lie. I did my arms, too. But, um… I can’t lie to you guys. I can’t. Uh… Right. So, they make you pay up front. Which makes so much sense, now that I think about it. Because… it hurts so much. By the second session you’re like, “Oh, I would gladly pay $3000 to never come back here again. That would be a bargain.” It’s so painful. And I have a… I feel like I have a high pain… I think most women have a high pain threshold. I’ve been punched in the face thrice. And that’s another story for another time. But I… It’s a different kind of pain. It’s like nerve ending… Like nerve damage. Like, they give you stress balls, and you squeeze them. And by the time you pry your fingers open, they’re just, like, pyramids of powder, basically. It hurts so much. I remember telling myself like, “You are a grown woman.” That is your money to waste. You earned that money. “Throw it out the window. It doesn’t matter.” And, uh, as I was walking back to my car after the second session… I actually can remember exactly, like, the words I was saying to myself as I was walking to the car. I was like: “What you just went through was trauma.” “That was traumatic.” And right in that moment I got a text message from my boyfriend, who was in Guatemala at the time with UNICEF. And it just said… It said, “I just spent the morning” with a woman who watched her son get murdered.” And I was like, “You think that’s bad?” ‘Cause I have… I have a hard time with perspective. Like, I don’t gain it with experience, I guess. I was walking around here in Los Angeles, judging people. And that’s not me being my best self. I’m not proud of it. But that was just the scenario. And I remember just thinking, like, “You fucking…” petty, small-minded, materialistic twats. “You do not get it.” With their, like, $1500 purses. It’s a bag. It holds shit. Get a backpack. You’re silly. You know? I’m like, “You don’t even get it.” We’re breathing egos, acting like we aren’t a speck of dust on a speck of dust on a speck of dust hurtling through outer space. “We’re nothing.” A',\n",
       "  'nd then in the very next moment I’ll be like: “I want my face on money.” I really do. I feel like I deserve… I want my face on money, period. I just… I want my period face on money. It’s like: No, it’s more stoic. It’s like: Aw, I just heard my sister laughing. She’s dead. No, she’s here. I’m kidding. She’s here. I, um… I had a dog for many, many years. And he was my best friend. And I was always talking to him. Whenever I was home, I was talking to him. And then he died, and I stopped talking to him. Makes sense. Or does it? I don’t know. I mean, does that really make sense? He’s just as much a part of the conversation now… In a box on my desk. I stopped… This is what it is. I stopped talking to myself because there wasn’t a dog in the room. That’s crazy. So, now I have a new dog, Mary. I, um… I rescued her. Or I like to think she rescued me. I don’t know which is the less cunty way of putting it. But I have her. And she is my world. And, uh, I love her so much. She’s my everything. She’s young, and she’s full of life. And she’s obsessed with squirrels. And she’s kind of gotten me into it, too. And she’s just, like, such a cuddler, and we play. And we, like, spoon at night, and… I’m just gonna put a pin in that for a second and double back and say… that squirrel line, I would call that, in comedy, a throwaway joke. I knew it was gonna get a laugh when I said: “She’s obsessed with squirrels, and she’s kind of gotten me into it, too.” But you just keep going to that main joke. That’s a throwaway joke. It makes it extra cool. Now I’ve ruined it ’cause I doubled back and, like, I’m, like, talking about it. Now it’s ruined. It’s not a throwaway joke anymore. But it was. This is probably for two people in the audience, but I would say a throwaway joke is cool… the way that it’s cool, like… I play basketball. If you, like, during a pickup game, you make, like, a sweet three-point shot, and then afterwards, you don’t smile. You just go right back into defense. That’s the same coolness of a throwaway joke. All right. So… Really? That’s never gotten a laugh before. Well, you didn’t have to undo it. Keep laughing. So, um… The truth is, I am… I have gotten into squirrels. And now I’m gonna get you into squirrels. I’m not kidding. Wait until you see. I learned a fun fact about squirrels… that I’m so excited to tell you. I can’t… I’m… Okay, this is what it is. It’s this. Squirrels… cannot find 80 percent of the nuts they hide. Are you kidding me? Is that the greatest thing you’ve ever heard in your life? First of all, animals aren’t supposed to make mistakes. But secondly… I made this realization that is gonna blow… Hold your skulls in, because your brains are gonna fucking explode. That’s how trees are planted. Are you fucking kidding me? That’s how trees are planted. God, or the universe, or nature, or whatever the fuck, created this anxiety-ridden… Paranoid cokehead… that thinks that everybody wants their acorns. Nobody wants your acorns. No one else in the world eats acorns. Only you. That they hide them everywhere. And then they’re so fucked up on coke… They can only find two out of every ten. Squirrels plant trees. In Israel. Right. That I added. That’s not true. I added that. So, Mary is my dog. And I love her. And she got me into squirrels. And she’s young, and she’s full of energy. But… she’s dying… in that, it’s out there. It might be in two weeks. It might be in 12 years. But it’s out there, and it’s looming over me. And my heart can’t take it. I made a mistake. I shouldn’t have gotten another dog. It’s too much. I’m… Don’t judge me. I’m gonna put her to sleep now. I just… I need it to be done. And you know what? In my defense… in the scope of history… whether she dies tomorrow when I put her to sleep, which I’m doing… Or she dies naturally in 12 years, it’s not even a blip in the scope of history. It’s the same exact time. So, I’m right. And I… And she won’t die in vain, ’cause I’ll crucify her. Oh, my God. How cute would that be? I didn’t tell you, she’s little, and she’s got, like, long legs. And, like, her feet kind of naturally do that thing anyway. And then like: Oh, I would have to break her arms. I would. Listen, if you wanna be a legend, you’ve gotta suffer. You think Jesus would be famous if we put him down like a household pet? No. Jesus, son of God… died for your sins… uh, in his sleep while surrounded by his favorite toys? That’s ridiculous. I’m gonna… Okay. I’m gonna be indulgent… and tell a story that’s just a true story. Um… It’s about one of my sisters. I have three sisters. This is about one of them. Um… I won’t say which one. But… her name is Jodyne. Um, Jodyne went to Boston University. And if you’re familiar with BU, they have coed dorms. Which most ',\n",
       "  'universities have now. Um… But they have coed bathrooms in the coed dorms. And Jodyne, uh, got the drunkest she had ever been her freshman year, like so many freshmen do. And she stumbled back to her room, and she managed to get her, uh, jeans off, you know, and just passed out in a T-shirt and underwear. And a few minutes later, the room started spinning. And she ran to the bathroom, and she started throwing up. And she’s vomiting. And while she’s vomiting, she can feel that somebody is tugging her underwear down. But she couldn’t turn around or stop it, um, because she was throwing up so hard. And she’s vomiting and vomiting, and they’re tugging her underwear down. It’s going down, all the way down to the ground. And she finally finishes throwing up, and she whips her head around to see who’s there. But she didn’t see anybody. Because she had been shitting herself. That’s… That’s a true story. I’m gonna say… Like, I would call that a relief laugh. Or, like, a release laugh. I know that I’m your show. But you have to understand, like, you’re my show. And you were so beautiful. You were so… You had so much empathy. You were so worried. You could hear a pin drop in this story. It was so nice. And, you know, I understand. You thought she was gonna get raped. And she thought she was gonna get raped. She thought she was about to get raped. And I’ve really thought about this. And I… I think this may be one of the only scenarios where you can look down at a pair of underwear… just: Just filled with your own shit… and think, “Oh, thank God.” Oh, my God. “Oh, literally, yay.” My sister came to visit me. Not the “shitting in her pants” sister, but the, um… My oldest sister. Although, I’m sure she’s shit her pants. She’s a Silverman, after all. Uh, no, this is my oldest sister, Susie. She is a rabbi. She lives in Jerusalem. Um… “Oh, my God, a godless comedian” and, like, a total God-person rabbi are sisters? “What must that be like?” is something you can muse about in the car. So, Susie came to town. And she said, “Sarah, I’m meeting my friend Amber tomorrow.” And then she told me all about Amber. She’s like, “Amber is so amazing.” She was born and raised in Ethiopia. She single-handedly ran an orphanage there. She’s so inspiring. I’m meeting her tomorrow at 8 a.m. “Can we use your apartment to meet?” And I said, “Of course, sure.” You know. “Use your key. I’ll be sleeping. But, yeah.” So, the next morning, she forgot her key, of course. And she’s knocking at the door, and I go to answer the door. My eyes are, like, glued shut. And I open the door, and she goes, “Sarah, this is Amber.” And I said, “Amber, it’s so nice to meet you. I’ve heard so much about you.” And I grabbed her hand. And her hand was a hook. And… Not important to the story, just for color, both of her hands were hooks. But, um… I was in too deep. I just… I shook it. I shook her hook. And it was such a false moment, too. I’m sure she would have appreciated if I was like: “You have a hook for a hand. I don’t know what the etiquette is.” And she’d be like, “Thank you for being real with me.” Nobody’s ever real with me. “Yes, you can shake it, whatever.” And then we would be real friends, and we’d probably have inside jokes, and that’s how it plays out in my mind. But… I just shook her hook as if to say: “This is what a hand feels like to me.” Bye. And went back to sleep. And pretended it was all a neat dream. But Jesus Christ, rabbi. She must have told me nine things about Amber. Two of them should have been hooks, right? I’m not being an asshole. Minimum. She’s got hooks for hands. She’s amazing. She lives in Ethiopia. She single-handedly ran an… That would have made more sense. She’s brilliant, she’s inspiring. Double back, just a reminder… she’s got hooks for hands. But not Susie, not the rabbi. She doesn’t see color. She doesn’t even see hands. That’s how amazing she is. I’m a… I’m a… I’m a very sexual person. Um… You can always tell a sexual person because they, um, tell you as a segue to their next bit in their stand-up act. It’s kind of a little hint. I am, though. I… I know that it’s cool to talk crazy during sex, and I… I have tried that. And it doesn’t work for me, because I just… I find that the truth, uh, gets in the way, I guess. Like, I… Like, “God, your cock is so… Oh, no, never… It was a shadow.” What I do, I feel like, is way crazier. I like to talk crazy right after sex. When things have calmed down a beat. Get right in his face, real quiet. “What do you think would happen if I went to the hospital” and got a rape exam right now? Yeah, what do you think? You think they’d find your semen all over and inside me? ‘Cause I do. Oh, I really do. Maybe you should tickle my back till I fall asleep. “Is t',\n",
       "  'hat a good idea, motherfucker?” My boyfriend’s foreign, so, then I get, like, really nose to nose with him and go, “USA’s number one.” He’ll be like, “Number one in what?” “You don’t worry about it.” It’s important to us that we’re number one. “Juvenile diabetes.” What is the etiquette…? I don’t know if there are, like, any Emily Post-ish people here. But for postcoital cuddling, uh, or after-sex cuddling, if you’re stupid, what is the…? What is the etiquette for where I would put my… “his asshole” fingers? Is it just straight out to the side? Or… under a pillow? Or just… Just sever it. Just cut it off completely. That’s… That’s what happened to Amber’s hands. I’m kidding, you guys. Come on. Relax. It was land mines when she was 7. Look, sometimes I like to end a joke with a sad truth. Thank you, Jodyne. You’re killing it, Sarah. We give our daughters Barbie dolls so that they have an image of what they should look like when they grow up that is not attainable so that they can learn that they’re a piece of shit and they should kill themselves. It’s so important. We have to teach them young. I’m not sure, uh… who designs the schematics of these Barbie dolls, or Bratz dolls, or any of the sex-worker dolls. I’m not sure who we’re protecting. Uh… Where the obscenity lies, or… Okay, so, Barbie. Like, her legs are twice the length of the rest of her body. And her feet are just: They’re just on tiptoes. She can only wear high heels. She couldn’t wear flats if she wanted to. When she’s taking a shit at 3 in the morning, she’s in heels. ‘Cause she’s a lady. Her breasts… Okay. So, uh… she only has, like, the big, fat, shiny part of the breast that guys jerk off to. We have to protect our daughters… from the life-nourishing nipple. We… That’s just too obscene. No nipples. We can’t have our daughters seeing what nourishes life. Just the part that can sandwich a hard cock. No pubic hair. That is attainable. You’re right, audience. You know what? Thanks for keeping me honest. That’s important. It is attainable. Not everybody can pull that look off, but yes. People always want Angelina Jolie’s lips. And I’m not bragging. I basically have Angelina Jolie’s lips. It’s not all it’s cracked up to be. But, um, mine are in my underpants. But… That’s why I like a nice… groomed but triangular… nuanced bush. That doesn’t technically make sense, but it sounded fancy. I did a, um…\\nArt reflects life. Okay? And then, uh, life informs art, you know? And then, um… But we don’t… Movies, I don’t feel like really reflect life totally for women. It’s more of like a male’s projection of it. It’s getting a little better, but even in artsy-fartsy movies, like, if you see a woman masturbating in a scene, she’s always on her back. All dreamy and sexy. She’s never on her stomach, dead-eyed and slack-jawed, like it is. It’s work. We learn what love is from movies and television, and it’s ruined love for us. Romantic comedies, all that shit, it’s ruined love. We… It’s taught us that we are incomplete people who need to find that one person in the whole world that will complete us. I promise you, there are thousands of people that are perfectly good matches for any one of you. And I don’t want to be complete… I don’t… I’m working very hard to be a complete person every day, you know? I don’t… I don’t wanna make you whole. I want you to come whole. I want you to be in… And I know I just said “come hole.” Another thing Barbie does not have. That would be a really weird feminist stance. “Why doesn’t Barbie have a come hole?” “I don’t know. What is that? It’s subjective.” Noted. I did a fundraiser here a few years ago with, um, my friend Lizz Winstead’s organization, Lady Parts Justice. Check it out. And, uh, it was basically… I always say it was like a, you know, um, “right to choose” kind of thing. But it was, technically, literally, just for women in Texas. Because, at the time, every abortion clinic was being shut down in Texas. They were down to five. It’s since gotten much worse. But, um… And we just literally wanted to raise money to give to women in Texas so they could, like, hire a babysitter while they drive 12 hours to get an abortion. Or an affordable mammogram, or a, you know, pap smear, or whatever. And, uh, so, we did this show, and there were protestors outside. Um, you know, “right to life,” uh, Westboro Baptist Church-y, NPR people. And… Not NPR. NRA. That is… They are different. Completely different tote bags. Um, and they were outside protesting. And I’m not gonna shit on them, because I am them. We’re the same. You know, I’m the product of how I was raised. I was raised by a couple of liberal bleeding-heart Democrat Jews, and now I am one. And I would love to think that I’d get there on my own, ',\n",
       "  'but probably not. I’m the product of how I was raised. And these people were raised by people who loved them who said, “There are people out there that want to murder babies.” If I was that kid, I’d be like, “We have to stop them.” And I’d be outside there protesting. So, I went outside, and I just wanted to say hi and show a warm, friendly face to baby murderer. And I said, uh, “Hey, hi. Isn’t it great…? I just wanna say”, isn’t it great that we live in a country where I can put on this show because it’s something that I believe in, and you can protest this show because of what you believe in, “and we can occupy the same space peacefully?” And he said, “God, you’re totally right.” I’m just kidding. He goes, “You’re going to hell.” And I was like, “Okay, nice to meet you.” But there was, like, a 9-year-old girl there with a little pink cardigan. And she had a huge… She had a sign, like, twice her size. And it said, uh, “Abortion is bloody murder.” And the “bloody” was, like, in red paint, dripping down. And that was the first time I was like, “Oh, they had to go to, like,” Michaels or Blick’s or something and buy crafts. “Hobby Lobby, probably.” And she goes: “God hates you.” And I was like, “Do you really think God hates?” And she goes, “Yeah, he hates you.” And then… Oh, I told her a doodie joke. And she was like: It really is the great unifier. But she is right. Abortion does kill, like, your whole day. It literally sucks the life out of you. Look, I know those last two jokes, they aren’t smart. They have nothing deep to say. They’re just wordplay. But I love them like my… very own aborted fetuses. Um… Put a pin in that. Congratulations, Texas. Texas was almost the third state… uh, but then a judge put the kibosh on it. You should know this. I’m not blaming you for not knowing about this law, because we’ve been… Just atrocity after atrocity has been coming at us every day. But you’re not gonna believe this. It’s true. They have a law where if you get an abortion in those states or have a miscarriage, you are responsible for paying for a funeral for the fetal tissue. What? What? Crazy. And heinous. And I want to speak at those funerals so bad. He died the way he lived. The size of a sesame seed with no discernable brain function. He will be returned now to the soil… where he will… I don’t know, get eaten by a cricket, maybe. So, anyway, this fundraiser. This is the thing, is the religious right knows that it will be a bear of a… Not the religious right. I guess the government now… knows that it would be a bear of a job. To overturn Roe v. Wade, to just make abortion illegal all at once. So, what they do is they chip away at it from the sides, you know. They make little laws, insincere laws, that kind of are an ends to their means. You know, uh, “All right, uh, your clinic has to have hallways” that are 18 feet wide.” And then the clinics are like, “We can’t…” We don’t have… I mean, that would cost… We couldn’t afford to… “. “Well, I guess you’re gonna have to close, then, aren’t you?” You know, it’s very, uh, Boss Hogg from Dukes of Hazzard or something. You know, like, smashing your headlights and going: “Looks like you can’t drive. You got a smashed headlight.” It’s exactly that. And violating… Uh… Infantilizing laws about abortion where women have to think about it. Go home for three days and think about it. Yeah, I think I’ve been thinking about it, fuckface. Or, like… Violating ultrasounds, you know, where they shove a camera inside you and make you look at the ultrasound and see the life in your uterus. And… Put a pin in that for a second. Because I have another fun fact for you you’re gonna love. This is true. Scientists have known this for almost two decades. If you believe in science. That… And this is it. Sperm can smell. I know… I know sperm can… We all know sperm can smell. But… Sperm cells… Seashells by the seashore. Sarah, come on, focus. This is a big night. This is serious, though. Sperm cells have a sense of smell. They have olfactory senses. That’s true. And you know what that means. That means that sperm is life. And you know what that means. We’ve gotta legislate that shit. We have to protect the babies. I… I just wanna save the unborn babies. That’s all I’m worried about, and this is what we’re gonna do. The next time you feel like you’re gonna jerk off into a gym sock or down your shower drain or, uh… I don’t know why, I peg you as an “on the belly” guy. It doesn’t matter, though. It doesn’t matter. Whatever your jerk-off style, there is no judgment here. I was right, wasn’t I? I have a sense. If only that was a superpower that could help the world. But… This is what we’re gonna do. Before you do jerk off, whatever style it is… Um… I feel like k',\n",
       "  'eeping going. Like… you are like a hands-free fucking the mattress. Like, you’re just flat… Blink once if… I knew it! You guys are humoring me. You guys are nice. All right. Come on, Sarah. Before you do it, you’re gonna come on down to the clinic. We’re gonna take a long, thin… Like a knitting-needle-shaped GoPro camera, basically. It’s gonna go up your urethra, your penis hole. Up, up, up. Really picture it. And then down, down into your testicular sac. We’re gonna bring the ultrasound around, and you’re gonna be able to actually see the life in your balls. I truly believe… that most men will not even want to jerk off after that. And that’s a beautiful thing. Show business is so weird. I don’t know why this is when it really struck me. But I did an episode… A few years ago, I did that show, The Good Wife. Okay? And it’s, like, a law drama. And it was really fun. And maybe it’s ’cause I was, like, sitting and watching a lot of them shoot. You would never believe how show business works. It’s so crazy. Like, okay. Let’s see if I can explain this. Like… It’s… So, this scene is a big boardroom scene, right, ’cause it’s a law drama. And it’s got a bunch of characters in it. And they’re all talking, and all this shit happens in it. So, the first shot they do, they do a big, wide shot of the whole scene with all the characters and everything. They do that a few times. Then they go in close and they shoot, like, a tight shot where it’s just, like… You only see, like, three of the characters. And when they exit that scene, like, in our minds we see the whole room because we’ve seen it before. But in reality, when they’re shooting it, the rest of the room isn’t even there. It’s, like, filled up with, like, reflecting boards and cameras and lights and, you know, all this other shit, you know. I don’t know all the words. Cameramen and, uh, all that shit. So, it’s like, uh, Christine Baranski will go: “I want those papers on my desk Monday morning.” And she’s literally in her skirt suit and heels. Christine Baranski in a ball because she can’t leave entirely, ’cause there’s so much shit blocking the way. But she has to get as low as possible so she doesn’t block the lights for the rest of the scene, for the actors that are still in the scene. So, she’s like this. And then Josh Charles is like: “She’s a piece of work. I’ll see you Monday.” Everything you watch is that. I just burped. I’m a human being. I was, uh… Three weeks ago, I was at a red light. No, put a pin in that for a second. Okay. I took an acting class when I was 10 in New Hampshire. This goes together. And, first of all, this acting teacher was mean. I remember he said, like, um… Oh, one assignment was, bring in your favorite song and, like, act out to it. And then I brought in my favorite song, which is, like, um… ♪ Just a city boy Born and raised… ♪ “Don’t Stop Believin’.” Sorry. And, like, I thought that acting was mouthing it. So, I was like: And he went bananas on me. And you know, I wish at 10 I had the wherewithal to be like: “You know what? He’s probably going through something.” “That’s his.” No. I didn’t know to do that when I was 10. I just assumed I was a piece of shit. But that’s not the story I wanted to tell. So, the first day of acting class, he said this: “Acting…” “is reacting.” And I’m like, “What does that mean?” Like, “re”? I knew “re” meant again. So, I was like, “Acting again?” Anyway… Three weeks ago, I was at a red light. And I was like: “Oh, reacting.” Right. Oh, yeah. I agree with that, yes. Acting is reacting. “You should have said it that way.” Latent… realizations. That’s the theme of this chunk when I do my special. Latent… Latent realizations. Like… Okay, I had to go to sleepaway camp… every year since I was 6 years old. And, uh, it was terrible for me because I was a chronic bed wetter till I was, like, 15. So, it was a nightmare. I learned a lot of skills, like complete disassociation. Making a cot over soaking-wet sheets while I stink like piss and pretending like that’s not the case. What kind of parents would send a chronic bed wetter to sleepaway camp? They must be monsters. No. They’re not monsters. Here’s the thing. Okay. Like, my dad… his dad beat the shit out of him every day. And then during the school year he was sent away to goyim. To boarding school. I’m sorry. To boarding school. And then at boarding school… he got the shit kicked out of him every day, called a dirty Jew kike, because it was back when, like… America was great. And… And then in the… All right. That was pretty good. And then in the summertime, he went to camp and blossomed and was a star and was, like, everything he wanted to be. And so, parents, they just think… You know, he just thought, “No, camp is gre',\n",
       "  \"at.” It will define her. It will be her joy. Because that’s what it was for me.” You know? So, I had to go to camp. And as a compromise, he would give me joke books. Because I loved jokes. And then, also, maybe I’d make friends that way. So, I remember the summer I was 8 because I had just learned to read when I was 7. Someone in the audience when I was in Vermont was like, “I was 4.” Fucking good for you. I was 7. I learned to read when I was 7. So, I was 8, I was excited. I had books. I was gonna read. And my dad has no boundaries. I don’t know if he flipped through these at all or didn’t. Um, but it was Truly Tasteless Jokes book one and two. And I remember the first joke on the first page. It was a paragraph long, but I can tell it in two seconds. It was “Little Red Riding Hood, blah, blah, blah.” And then the big bad wolf is like, ‘I’m gonna eat you.’ And then Little Red Riding Hood’s like, ‘Eat, eat, eat. “Doesn’t anybody fuck anymore?'” And I’m like, “What does this mean?” Then when I was 30 I was like, “Oh, Jesus Christ.” That’s so inappropriate.” He was, uh… My dad isn’t… He has no boundaries. He’s not approp… I don’t really… He… He treated us like bros. Like, um, I remember one time when I was really young, he and my mom went on a double date. And when he came home, he, like, plopped down on the front hall… There was, like, a bench in the front hall. And I was sitting there, and I asked him how it went. And he was like, “Oh, it was the fucking worst.” Uh, we were supposed to go out with the Sterlings, and then only Mr. Sterling showed up. Because he said Mrs. Sterling had her period. And when she gets her period, it comes out like liver. “And I’m like, ‘I don’t need to know that.'” I was like, “Dad, I get it.” Like, I’m 5, and I don’t even need to know that.” But my dad, um… Camp was where he thrived. And, like, they’re still his best friends to this day. His best friends are his friends from camp. And he’s about to be 80, and they’re having a reunion, even. And he has a picture of all of them, uh, when they became counselors. And it’s amazing. It’s from 1953. And I said, “Dad, you have to send me this.” And he sent it to me with, like, a glossary of who everybody is and what they’re doing now. And it’s like: “This is Phil Holman. He’s a judge now.” This is Arnie Goldstein. You know, he owns Martin’s House of Cloth. This is Danny Gold. Danny Gold once gave Punchy Kramer a BJ and we all watched. This is Cy Schwartz. He works at the Clam King. This is bah, bah, bah. He da, da, da. This is Morris Simon. This is Punchy Kramer. “This is, you know, blah, blah, blah.” I’m like, “Dad, open with it or close with it.” He has no sense. So, he went to camp all the way up until he became a counselor. And, uh, you know, we think of counselors, like, as grown-ups. But, you know, they’re 16-year-old kids. So, for each camper, he had to fill out a form, uh, every week for each camper. And it would say, like, “Is he behaving?” Is he sleeping? Did he brush his teeth? “Did he go to the bathroom?” And under that it said, “L/H.” And my dad didn’t know what that meant. But he was too embarrassed to ask anybody. So, he just used his logic, and he’s like, “Okay.” It comes after bathroom, so it must mean… “‘loose or hard.'” So, for a summer… My dad had his campers come get him… after they took shits… so that he could go look at them… and make a rough guesstimate… if it was indeed loose or hard. I love that so much. It just means there’s, like, a generation of old men in therapy… who are like: “Well, I did have a camp counselor that was, like, obsessed with my shits. Is that…?” You were sexually abused. Oh, it meant “letter home.” But thank God he didn’t ask. That would have been so embarrassing. My parents got divorced when I was 7. And my mom went back to college to get her degree. And my sisters were older. So, I got babysat by nuns. I went to, like, a nun… A convent, I guess. But it looked like a… Like a Victorian house or something, where nuns were. And they had day care. And I have since met amazing nuns. These were not them. These were cunts. They… They were. They hit us. It was… I had not been hit before, you know. And I was so scared of them. Like, if we weren’t sleeping on our, like, little mats during nap time, they would hit us. And then, like, um, for lunch we would go out into the woods, ’cause it’s New Hampshire, and they gave us these peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches, and we had to eat the whole thing, or they would hit us. And I loved peanut butter and jelly. But this was different. It was peanut butter and jam. And jam is… I hadn’t experienced jam before. It’s like… It’s different. It has, like, pieces in it. But we had to eat the whole thing, or they would hit us. \",\n",
       "  'I was so scared, I… ‘Cause I didn’t know I could take a punch at that time. And I… Okay, wait. Put a pin in that. Put a pin in that while I tell you something. This is human behavior, that we tell ourselves horror… Horror stories. Horror stories. Horror stories. Horror stories. Horror. Horror stories. We tell ourselves… I said it too many times. We tell ourselves horror stories. That’s just the human condition. You know, like we go, uh, “I have to pass that crack in the road before that car passes me, or I’ll die.” That wasn’t just you. That’s everybody. Everybody does that. My therapist says it’s how we deal with mortality. Um, so, I was eating this peanut-butter-and-jam sandwich, and I was telling myself horror stories. And the horror story was… this jam is the nuns’ period blood. But I had to eat it all. I was so scared of getting hit. I ate it like this. And I gobbled it down. I don’t know what… put in my head that… jam would, you know, have, like, chunky liver-like pieces in it. Okay, I’m gonna try to tell you this story. I almost died this summer. I really almost died this summer. I, um… I was on the road. Had a shitty sore throat. Didn’t think much about it. Kind of turned into a cold, that kind of thing. Uh, then I came home, and I got that same sore throat again. So, I go, “Ehh, I’m home. I’ll go to the doctor.” Which I never do. So, I went to the doctor. And, uh, he made me wait, like, a long time. And I was going to go, like, “Oh, fuck this.” But I stayed. He looks down my throat, and he’s like: “We’re going to the emergency room.” I had a… Like an abscess at the top of my… windpipe, which is where your breathing comes from. So, um, like, this abscess was either gonna grow another millimeter and stop my breathing and I would die, or it was gonna explode, and it’s filled with poison, and that would kill me. Um… Don’t be scared. It’s really rare. It’s not going to happen to you. Unless it does, I guess. But… So, I had to go to the hospital. And then, um, they put me under, like, a general… Like a… Some sort of drug just to chill me out before surgery. And, like, unbeknownst to me, they’re telling my, uh, friend Amy and my boyfriend, Michael, they’re like, um, “This is a very dangerous surgery.” She might not make it. You know, it’s very risky.” Blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, I feel fine. And I’m just like, “I’m not high enough.” I was complaining that I wasn’t high enough. And I can tell you exactly what happened because Amy had the utter distaste to record this whole thing. So… You just see me going like, “I’m not high enough.” And then they’re like, “You’re okay.” And then I proved to them that I wasn’t high enough, um, by explaining Brexit. And it was very nuanced, and I had opinions. It was, like, really perfect. Like, you can hear the anesthesiologist go, like: “Wow, she’s right on.” And, um… And then, uh, you see me, like, getting wheeled out. And then, um, like, Michael and Amy couldn’t come with me, like, past the operating-room doors or whatever. So, as I’m leaving, I said to Michael… Which is something we like to do, if the elevator doors are closing or something: “I wanna see other people.” And then… And then the last thing you see on the video is me looking into her phone and going like, “Play this in slow motion on my death reel.” So, um… So, then I had this surgery. And I lived. And, um… But it was really… It was a rough week because I have very low blood pressure, I guess. And so, they couldn’t put me to sleep for it. And so, I had to have… Once the surgery was done, they put a breathing tube down my throat. And then because it’s human nature if you’re awake to pull something that’s in your throat out, they had to tie my hands down. So, every time I would wake up, I would go to pull this thing out of my throat. And then I would see that my hands were tied down, and then I just thought what anyone would think in that situation, which is, “I’ve been captured by ISIS.” And it was so scary. And then a sister would have to come to my side and be like, “Sweetie, you’re okay. You just had surgery. They have to have your hand…” You know, and then I would understand. And then I would fall asleep, and a minute later I would wake up and the whole thing would happen again. And it was really scary. It was a nightmare. I don’t remember… Like, I was awake, but I don’t remember anything. And there were a few funny stories. Like, um… I would be really itchy. The medicine that was in me was so itchy. But my hands were tied down. And my sisters would fight with the nurses to just let one hand free so I could scratch. So, they finally did. And, uh, it was… like, I had an itch, like, just vagina-adjacent. And I… It felt… It was, like, so much relief. And then my frien',\n",
       "  'd John was standing in the corner. And I guess… I don’t remember this. I was told this. I pulled my hand out and then I, like, served it to John. And then, another time, like, my hands were tied down. And, um… That I served it? And then, um… He was like: In my mind. I don’t remember. Oh, another time… I was told, a nurse was in the room, and I, somehow, like, even though I had no mouth or hands, but I, like, made it clear to her, like, it was an emergency. I had to tell her something. And they had given me paper and a pencil. And I’m writing, and it’s, like, so important. And I finally finish, and then I show it to her, and she looks, and it just says, “Do you live with your mother?” With a picture of a dick. And, I mean… it’s really proof that once your conscious mind is out of the way, it’s just, like, sheer comic genius. You guys, we’ve reached the denouement. Were you making a noise because you’re impressed that I knew that word? Thank you. You’ve been very vocal, but in the perfect amount. You’re welcome. Like, the next time you wanna, like, be like, “Yay,” for me or something, let’s do this. You can go like this: Okay, the denouement. Did I say it right? Now we’re gonna have to, like, pick up a shot of you going: Um, yeah, because we’re here. Um… Jesus is coming back. Oh, on my back. That’s what it is. It was water. He turned it to come. How clever is that? I don’t know if there’s God. I mean, I cannot imagine there’s God. But I don’t know. Neither do you, you know? But if there is God, it’s a God that’s, like, totally fine with murder and, uh, children starving and… spin class. You know, all the… All the atrocities of life. I take… Spin class is great, if you love being punched in the vagina 70 times a minute. While just an ocean… Thank you, Steve Agee. While just an ocean of white people are singing the N-word with such glee. It’s because they play hip-hop music in there. Did I need to say that? Oh, my gosh. Were you guys like, “Is that what they do in there?” “Can I burn calories doing that?” Yes. I feel… I feel like a fraud because I feel like I talk so much about God and Jesus and all this stuff, and… I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I’m going to admit it. I have not read the Bible. I’ve tried. I have tried. In my defense, it’s unreadable. It’s so boring. It’s so dense. But it’s, like, not as deep as it thinks it is. And it just reads like a super-shitty Game of Thrones spec script or something. When is that coming back, Game of Thrones? – Not until… – June. – April? – June. – June. – June? It just was June. Oh, my God. I love it so much. It’s not perfect. It isn’t perfect, though. It’s like they… ‘Cause, look, everybody wears 900 pounds of armor. Then nothing from here to here. They just have this area to breathe. You know what the number one cause of death is in Game of Throne-y times? Neck stabs. Head-chopped-offs. Throat slits. I’m just saying, there’s a blacksmith in the fictional past that should be fired. The app that I do Twitter with, I can, um… I just sounded so old saying that. The app that I do Twitter with, it’s like I can schedule tweets. Which I like, because sometimes I’ll think of two, three tweets. I don’t wanna spoil you. I space them out. Many years ago now, the beginning of Twitter, practically, I scheduled a tweet. I scheduled it for 8:05 p.m. Pacific Time. Why would I remember that? Because at 8 p.m. Pacific Time… we captured and killed Osama bin Laden. The Twitterverse was aflame. At 8:05… I tweeted: “Why do my dog’s doodies come out cold?” Let me just remind you, I scheduled that tweet. That’s how good I thought it was. And I feel a little bit like Peter Sellers in Being There. Like, people put more depth on me than I have at all. I bet there were people that saw that tweet and were like: “You know what? That was cold. But it is our duty.” Okay, this is how I’m gonna end. I’m guessing this is a pretty godless crowd. Um, I like to… I’ve been on the road, and I like to end by asking if there’s a… Now I feel like a bully because it’s so godless. Usually when I’m in the rest of the country, I’m the only godless one, and then I don’t feel like an asshole. But are there any guys here that believe in God? Not like, “I believe there’s something.” I mean, like, an organized religion. Like Christian, Muslim, Jewish, bah, bah, bah… You’ve got, like, five seconds to raise your hand, if you’re close. Yeah, I didn’t think so. Really? Can you come up closer to me so that I’m in the light? But just come up to the stage. What’s your religion? Uh… I would say I’m Christian. You would say you’re Christian? There’s, like, a lot of different words we could use. I’m Protestant. I would probably classify myself as Lutheran. All right. Okay. What is your ',\n",
       "  'name, sir? – Troy. – Hi, Troy. – Hi. – Thank you for doing this. This is very brave. We’re in Los Angeles. It’s very godless. I draw the godless out. So, I don’t want you to feel bullied or something. It’s okay. I raised my hand voluntarily. What did you say your name was? Troy? – Troy. – Oh, okay. That’s fun. All right, Troy. I’m dying to ask this question. I’m so excited there’s a God person here. All right, you’re a Christian. – Right. – Protestant area. This is a question… that I think should be one of the big questions, even. Okay. Yes or no… would you let God come in your mouth? – No, no. – No? – No. – Okay, go back to your seat. Oh, my God, no. Thank you very much. Thank you, Troy. No. That’s mind-blowing to me. And yet not unique. Not a unique answer, I’ll tell you that. I would say the answer has to be yes. Um, but I will tell you that as I’ve been touring the country, 80 percent, at least, of men say no, like Troy. So, congratulations on not being unique. And yet being wrong, in my opinion. That is, uh, so petty, I think. You know, it’s like, up until now, Troy, you’re saying, “God…” I know that there’s AIDS and rape and famine and genocide and murder. But I know you have a plan, and I am your servant. Unless you’re serving come. “Then I’m out.” That’s so petty. God told Abraham to kill his son. And you know what Abraham said? “No problem. Chip! Get down here!” I know, I didn’t read the Bible, but everybody knows Abraham’s son was Chip. And Abraham was gonna murder his son. And then right before he did, God was like, “I’m kidding.” Can I come in your mouth?” Abraham’s like, “Is that a test of my faith?” God’s like, “Sure. Yes.” And then God came in Abraham… This is turning into fan fiction. But God came in Abraham’s mouth. And Abraham’s like: “Wow, I really thought that you were gonna stop at the last second like you did with the killing my…” Or I guess he’d be like, “Like you did with the killing my son.” God’s like, “I work in mysterious ways.” Thank you guys so much. – Okay. – I’m sharp as a tack. – There you go. – But they did just put something in intravenously. And it… And it feels like maybe… I’m getting high. Am I getting high? It feels like… It’s not that big a deal, actually. It’s not very intense. I feel like I could give a… I could argue a political side. Mm-hm. So, tell me… Talk me through Brexit. Brexit is like, you know, the same people that, uh… name their kids… Bentley ’cause they think that’s classy. They are the people voting for Brexit. Completely unknowing, innocent. Uh… Thinking it’s in their best interest. They’re voting completely against their best interest. These things that the EU provide their lives to make them livable. Uh, they’ve just ousted that. And they’re counting on the NHS, and that was a big sham promise. Mm-hm. Uh… You know. So, what are you gonna do? There are a lot of Bentleys in the world. A lot of Mercedes and Porsches. And they’re gonna be strippers. But some of them might be Supreme Court justices. Mm-hm. And I have hope. And I believe in people. We’re all just listening to the same… To different sets of lies. Maybe you should… – And she’s still making sense, too. – Maybe you should give her more. I am. I don’t feel very high. No, that’s right. No, no. That’s good. You’re perfect. You know… just if people were spoken to… This is what she’s like every day. By people who don’t have agendas and can just honestly make an earnest decision based on what they think is best for themselves and the country, we would have wild success all around. I know, right? But we don’t have that, unfortunately. I’m not high yet at all. This stuff is shit. Well… They’re gonna roll me into the ER and put me to sleep for a few days with a breathing tube. Some kind of new diet. Is that what you were expecting when you woke up? That wasn’t what I was expecting. – Okay. – Bye. I love you both so much. – I love you. – See you soon. See you on the flip side. Michael, I wanna see other people. Damn you. Okay, we love you. Love you. Bye-bye. Play that last bit in slow motion on my death reel.

       " ['Shane Gillis’ debut stand-up comedy special, recorded live at The Creek and The Cave in Austin, TX, offers a blend of edgy, controversial humor and personal anecdotes. Gillis touches on a variety of topics, from his own haircut mishaps to observations on family dynamics, politics, and societal issues. He jokes about his father’s Fox News obsession, racial dynamics in football, and the absurdity of modern social media culture. The special includes candid reflections on his family, like his sister’s struggles with addiction and recovery, and his own experience coaching in the Special Olympics. Gillis also delves into political satire, poking fun at both sides of the political spectrum, and provides irreverent takes on pop culture and current events. His approach mixes dark humor with a candid examination of the absurdities of everyday life. * * * All right, I was thinking about the first time Congress had to come up with an age of consent. Imagine those in powdered wigs, that had to be a rough day for the fellas. It’s like some guy coming up first, like from Rhode Island, “12!” And everyone’s like, “Ew, ew, no dude. I don’t know why I have to go first on this one. It’s like the hardest one to go first on.” [Laughter] This is exciting. I was a little too excited. I panicked and got this haircut. What an insane f*ckup. My hair was fine, totally fine, and then two days ago, I was like, “I gotta salvage this.” It’s crazy that I thought the hair was the issue, like fixing my hair would make me look good. That was the final piece of the puzzle for me. There’s a Dominican barber shop by my house in New York. I think I’m the first white guy that’s ever been in there. I was basically Christopher Columbus of this barber shop. And they f*cked me up, dude. Don’t get a Dominican haircut if you’re white; you end up just looking more racist. It was nice though, he kept trying to reassure me the whole time, “No, man, your head’s good.” I was like, “Oh, thank you, whatever this haircut is. How are you guys?” [Applause] It’s good, it’s good. I’m happy, it’s nice, everybody’s back inside and all that shit. I don’t know, I had a good time. I live in New York, so I left. I went back to my parents’ house because I have white privilege. Some people didn’t get to leave the city, I did, because of my privilege. And I used it. You gotta use it! You know what I mean? Does it feel more disrespectful to waste it? You know what, then we’re all just being racist for nothing. But no, it’s good. I went home. My parents, I haven’t lived with them in over 10 years. They got old. They’re old as f*ck. I’m back on milk. Been f*cking crushing milk lately. I got f*cking milk fat this year. It’s a weird time in life to have a milk renaissance. I’m 33. It was nice. I think my favorite part of the year was watching my dad watch the news. It’s a rough year for my dad and the news. He’s a Fox News guy. Don’t do that. It’s fine. Also, I see you guys, most of you have Fox News dads. How dare you deny your fathers? That’s a good dad. I don’t watch Fox, but that’s a good Fox News mom. That’s fat. You don’t want Fox News mom, that’s a bad mom. She smokes in the house. But a Fox News dad, that’s a good f*cking dad. Can you imagine if you had a f*cking MSNBC dad? There’s some guy every night at dinner like, “We need to start focusing on renewable energy.” It’s like, “Ew, dude, I didn’t know dad was gay, talking to me about solar panels like a f*cking lady.” He might have her straight as hell, dude. We f*cking hate the environment. Th',\n",
       "  \"at’s how straight we are. All we talk about is eating pussy and fracking. We hate nature. We go fishing. We don’t even eat fish. We just catch them and f*ck… He’s good, he likes Fox. He watches it every night like every Fox News dad. My dad watches Fox every night until he can’t. That’s how long they watch. They watch every night until they get so angry they have to go to bed. My dad will watch for like two hours and then out of nowhere, he’ll just stand up and be like, “F*cking Mr. Potato Head’s trans, I’m going to bed. This world’s going to hell.” He’s all about it, dude. He loves it. Like every Fox News dad, my dad watches Fox with one goal. He’s just trying to get one fact. That’s all he’s doing. He’s sitting there, trying to retain one piece of information that he can then relay to whoever’s unlucky enough to enter the living room while he’s watching. And you’d think it’d be easy to get one fact, but every once in a while, there’s like a commercial for like a commemorative 9/11 gold coin, just f*cking wipes their hard drive. “What was I watching? I gotta get one of those. I got my hands on those patriotic coins.” [Laughter] My dad drinks too, so he can never get a fact, ever. He’ll come in the living room, we’ll be, he’s hammered, watching the news every night, which is the wildest way to take in world politics. Like, just hammered on a a recliner, like, “Whoa.” It’s like footage of rocket attacks in Israel, he’s like, “Whoa, what the hell are they doing over there? What’s this guy’s problem?” But he can never get a fact. Like, he tries. He uses Fox News as like a PowerPoint for what he’s trying to say. Like, everyone, like, we’ll be eating dinner and like Hannity will be saying something, he’s like, “See that? That’s what I meant. Look at that. That’s me talking. I can’t say it that good.” He can never get a fact. You’ll walk in the living room, he’s been watching the news for three hours, he’ll be like, “Alright, what’s going on in the world?” He’s like, “Do you want to know? I’ll tell you. F*cking Nancy Pelosi is a bitch… All right, settle down, dude.” That was the news last, that’s the news every night from my dad. They’re just like, “Breaking, did you know Nancy Pelosi is a bitch?” I had a feeling. But he likes everything they say. He agrees with it. He’s all in. I realize, like, Fox News is basically Black Church for old white dudes. You know what I mean? Like, literally, everything they say, my dad just, “Say it, like, ‘Yes, preach, Tucker!'” Every once in a while, he gets hit with the Holy Spirit while he’s watching it. The Holy Ghost visits him, he’s just like, “Oh, Lord, build a wall! Can I get a wall?” He needs a wall. My dad needs a wall. For a guy who lives in central Pennsylvania, securing the southern border is oddly important to him. I don’t know what he’s worried about, like he’s going to lose his job. You know, like some guy from Honduras is going to walk the whole way to Pennsylvania, just slam a resume down on my dad’s boss’s desk: “You’re here for the sales position? Stay quiet, also.” I was just at the border of Arizona and Mexico. There’s a wall. I had no idea. I got down there, saw the wall, and I was like, “Holy shit, he built it.” They were like, “No, it’s been here, it’s been here for like a century.” You got to tell my dad. It’ll f*ck him up. He gets fired up every night. It’s a crazy way to go to bed every night, just… So, there’s apnea mask on every night. You walk in the living room in my house right now, my dad, he’d hit you like, “Southern bor\",\n",
       "  'der’s a mess, right?” It’s crazy. But I make fun of him for it, and then I do the exact same thing, just with my phone. Every night, I just look at my phone until I can’t. I’m like, “Mr. Potato Head’s trans, that’s it.” Every day, I just get on, read opinions from people I know are dumb. Like, in person, I know they’re dumb. I’ve talked to them. I’m still reading their Twitter, their political opinions. It’s great. And my Twitter is crazy. It’s half where I’m from, which is the middle of Pennsylvania, so it’s white trash. And then half, now I live in New York, so it’s crazy, they all got Twitter, they all get f*cking fired up, they have like zero followers and just tweet into the void… They love it, they do it for the love of the game. And now all my new friends, they’re literally communists from Brooklyn. So it’s wild, dude. My social, like, I’ll get on Twitter, and the first tweet I see will be someone from back home that’s just like, “F*cking Colin Kaepernick better stand up. Like this tweet if you support the police, share it if you’re not gay.” “I’m like, f*ck it, I’m sharing that.”And then the next post is just one of my new woke white friends that’s just like, “I’m not racist.” That’s it. Every day, for the last year, just a different white person popping up, like, “Look at me, look at this article I shared to my Instagram story. I’m not racist, right?” It’s like, “Alright, are you sure?” I don’t know if you know this, like being racist isn’t like a yes or no thing. You know what I mean? It’s not like you have it or you don’t have it. Being racist is more, it’s like being hungry. You know, it’s like, “Yeah, you’re not hungry right now. But a cheeseburger could cut you off on the highway, you get hungry.” We’re hungry all day. The cheeseburger is Jewish in that joke. No, okay. Cheeseburgers, whatever, whatever type of cheeseburger you thought it was in your racist heart. Anyway. That’s it. I just get online, read opinions from people. The news, like other news, is kind of like, “This is the most divided this country has ever been,” say with the, like, the red states and the blue states. It’s like, “Why? Because we tweet at each other?” You know, we had a war, right? You know, this country had a Civil War. That was pretty divided. Like, at least nowadays, we’re communicating with each other. Back then, those guys never… They got the news like once a month. Some guy would come by on a horse, and they were like, “Who’s talking shit?” The guy was like, “The South is talking shit.” “F*ck that, I don’t like that. Give me my gun. I’m gonna go down there. I’m gonna walk down there for a month straight, shoot the first f*cking guy I see down there.” The Civil War was basically just the North just shooting racism out of the South. That’s what happened. The North was like, “South, f*cking chill.” And the South was like, “No.” So a bunch of guys had to walk down there and shoot them a lot. And they’re like, “Alright, we’ll let them go, but we are not gonna be nice to them for a while until we find out they’re good at football and then, Roll Tide.” [Laughter] Yeah, “Roll Damn Tide.” I don’t like Alabama football. I watched this documentary on Alabama football. It’s great. It’s about… Well, it’s not… I don’t know if you should say it’s great. But it’s about Alabama football. It’s about when they desegregated their football team. So, up until this point, Alabama football was just white, alright? And everybody down there was pumped about that. They would pack the stadium, everyone would be ',\n",
       "  'like, “Look at all those whites running around, catching it.” Hey, look, I’m not knocking them too hard because I still have a little bit of that in me. You know, like if a white guy catches the ball on Sunday, I’m like, “Oh shit, go, go, go, go, go! Ah, they got him. They got him. It’s a tough run, a smart run, heads up run there.” But no, they took it too far. And uh, so the documentary focuses on that. It focuses on Bear Bryant. Bear Bryant, legendary head coach. He was the head coach that brought the first black players onto the team. So the whole documentary is like celebrating Bear Bryant. They’re like, “F*cking way to go, Bear. You did it. What a hero.” And then you find out it was 1971. Yeah, well, a little late for high fives on this one, fellas. Holy shit, 71? Like, we had been to the moon. There were literally people on the moon before Alabama had black guys in their secondary. [Laughter] Does anyone understand? There were white corners. White cornerbacks. You understand how preposterous that is? Some of you are too young to have ever even seen a white corner. They’re extinct. They don’t exist. There are two left at the San Diego Zoo. They won’t reproduce. You’ll never see a white corner. But that’s what happened. It wasn’t like… The reason they desegregated the team it was — that’s what the documentary focuses on, which is great — because it wasn’t like\\xa0 “Oh hey, fellas. It’s 1971. Maybe we should get with the times.” What happened was Alabama scheduled USC, Southern Cal. Alabama was confident. They’re like, “Oh, white boys will take on anybody and then USC came down to Alabama with a bunch of black dudes from L.A. and just beat the f*ck out of Alabama. And then after the game, Bear Bryant gave like a speech, and he was like, “Hey, y’all, come on.” That was it. That’s all it took. Everybody down there was like, “Yeah, we get it. We’ll be less racist if it means we can win.” What? That’s what it is. Like, as big as racism is in America, football, that’s true. That’s true. Look, the GOAT. There’s a Disney movie, Remember the Titans, dedicated to what I just told you. The whole point of that movie was one high school football season. Remember the Titans was like, eight weeks. You know, that whole town went from like centuries of like, “Don’t let them in our school,” to just like, “Oh shit, the high school team’s 4-0. Those are my brothers.” [Laughter] All right, I’ll get off the topic. The point I’m trying to make, the point I’m trying to make is, if you want to get rights in America, you just gotta put together a good football team. You know what I mean? Like, if the transgenders got together and put together just a f*cking hard-nose, run-it-down-your-throat ball club, the trans, just three yards and a cloud of dust of transgenders, if the trans community could just somehow upset Alabama, everybody down there tomorrow would be like, “Those are some tough bitches… actually, right.” [Applause] All right, we got out of that. There are some rough patches in there. That’s all right. Well, this won’t go great either. [Laughter] You know how like every show and movie now, it’s like a remake of something? They just remake an old thing and just make it more progressive and just put it out. Like, they remade Ocean’s 11, like a heist movie, with all gorgeous women. That movie should have been 10 minutes long. They literally should have got to the casino and just blown the security guards. They’d be like, “Here are the keys to the safe. Take everything. I love you. You guys, you cra',\n",
       "  \"zy bitches. I love you bitches.” It’s just… That’s all they make. They either make that or they make slavery movies every year. Those are for no one. I have black friends. I was like, “Dude, you guys like these?” They’re like, “No, we thought these were for you.” Like, “No, we all hate those.” Stop making them. It’s uncomfortable. Civil Rights movies are good, though. I like, like Judas and the Black Messiah was sick. Remember the Titans is great. Hidden Figures was the movie about the black ladies at NASA, or as my dad likes to call it, “Medea Goes to the Moon.” Look, that was him that said that. He said that. As soon as he said it, I was like, “What did you f*cking say? You don’t talk like that.” So every movie is just remade, more progressive. I just think it’d be funny if, like, the right started remaking, you know what I mean? If they just start, like, conservatives, like, there’s a new Scooby-Doo coming out. And it’d be funny if, like, the right remade it. It’s just like Scooby and the gang going around ripping the wigs off of transgender people. It’s like, “That’s not a woman!” Some guy, “I would have got away with it.” “We solved the case of the Starbucks ghoul.” [Laughter] Has enough time passed that we can admit that Trump was funny? Can we finally admit that? He was funny. Well, hold on, I don’t like the tone on that, that’s not what I’m going for here. “Yeah, the great leader…” He was funny. Now, whether or not that’s a great quality for the Commander-in-Chief, that’s definitely up for debate. But he was funny. I saw it. And I lived in New York, so the whole time he was in office, I would be like, you know, something would happen, I’d show my friends, like, “Look at that.” They’d be like, “What? It’s funny, okay? There’s nothing funny about Donald Trump.” I don’t… I don’t know. During Hurricane Dorian, he was like, “Maybe we should nuke it.” Like, that was a real suggestion from the president. The president of the United States. He was like, “Hey, we got a big storm coming. You guys want me to blow it up?” And I was like, “No, what the f*ck are you talking about?” “I don’t know, I just f*ck around dude. That’s what I do.” I don’t know. Now that he’s gone, I’ll never watch a debate ever again. Can you imagine, like, just a regular debate now, after we went like… We witnessed the GOAT, undefeated in debates, and he never said a fact. You know how impressive that is? He was funny, and he argued like a fifth grader. He was unstoppable. People tried to hit him with statistics and facts, he would just go, “Wrong.” Holy f*ck, dude. How is no one prepared for this? Go back and watch those debates. You forget how good, how electric that shit was. Don’t tell your friends in Austin, they’ll be mad. Just get a six-pack, toss on a Trump highlight video on YouTube. It’s a good night, dude. Why, I went back. I watched his first debate. That’s like my favorite one. At the time, Trump was pulling at like less than one percent. Like, he was nobody. If you guys like him now, you didn’t back then. And I know that because my dad, my dad at the time, any time Trump even came on TV, my dad was like, “Get this f*cking joker off the screen.” And then now, my dad’s like, “Guys can’t go to the Capitol? He’s like, ‘Guys can’t have fun anymore?'” It was because of the debates. That’s what did it, dude. That’s how we got Trump, these debates. And the first one is the best one. So it’s a Republican primary, everyone’s up on stage, and they’re all still doing their political shit So like the first co\",\n",
       "  \"uple of guys that talk are like, “I’m from Kentucky, and I love education.” And the crowd’s like, “Nice, we didn’t know what was coming.” Then the next guy’s like, “I’m from Georgia, and I love religion.” The crowd’s like, “Pretty good, this is a good one.” It was a heated debate. And then it finally got to Trump’s turn to talk, and he was just like, “Rand Paul is ugly.” And the whole crowd was like, “Oh, we didn’t know you could do that in this. You can just do that as your thing?” And Rand Paul was like, “Alright everybody, settle down. We’re trying to have a debate here.” And the whole crowd was like, “Shut the f*ck up, Rand Paul. Ugly bitch!” And we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make him debate Trump. It was not fair. It was mean for us to have done that to people. These guys were in politics their whole lives, and they just had to debate a f*cking maniac up there who didn’t give a f*ck. And I hated him, but it was fun to cheer for him in the debates. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates because, dude, he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years, and then he showed up to the event like, “Oh f*ck, what are we talking about?” He had no clue. Every week, he had no f*cking idea. There’s one debate, there’s one debate, he’s like in the middle of it, going back and forth about the economy with Ted Cruz. They’re literally talking about the economy, and in the middle of it, he’s just like, “Ted’s wife is ugly as a dog.” Holy shit, dude. Ted was like, “I’m from Texas, you don’t talk about a man’s family like that.” And Trump’s like, “You’ve got a dog wife, Ted. Everyone knows.” Yeah, and a week later, Ted Cruz was on TV like, “I support Donald J…” He’s like, “You pussy” I will say this, the one thing that sucked about Trump losing was, for me, it was because I just figured out kind of how to do his voice. That’s kind of a bummer. It’s not hard to do Trump. It’s very… all you have to do, do that, do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence, and then all you… like, you don’t have to sound like him, all you have to do is get his cadence down. It’s very easy. All you have to do is describe something and then say you described it that way. That’s it. It’s every time, like, “What a big room this is. I walked in here, I said, ‘Wow, what a big room.'” [Applause] “Austin, a lot of homeless. I walked in here, I said, ‘Wow, that’s a lot of homeless’.” You guys got it. You got a lot of homeless. What are you guys doing about it? Whatever you guys are doing is not working. So cheap. Switch, I don’t know what to do either, but do something. “A lot of tents.” [Laughter] “Why?” It’s been making me laugh, thinking about Trump, like not understanding why people are homeless. “I walked out, I saw them, I said, ‘Why are you living in tents?’ I could never. These guys…” But I will say this about Trump, I don’t want you guys to get… I don’t want to turn this into a rally. I will say this, so don’t freak out, just listen. I will… I think it’s fair to say that of all the presidents we’ve had, I think it’s fair to say that Trump would have been the funniest one to see get shot. You know, dude, the patriots got fired up on that. Dude, I was having fun at this show. No, look, I didn’t even say it would be funny. I said funniest. It’s a huge difference. Technically, there’s the funniest of everything. There is. It doesn’t make it funny, but there is, like, think of the worst thing you can think of. There’s a funniest one. I’ll go first. I’ll think of o\",\n",
       "  \"ne. School shooting. None of those are funny. Zero funny. But maybe there was one where, like, the horse girl in the class, like, could sense something was coming. You know what I mean? They’re like, “What’s wrong?” And she was like… [Laughter] But back to what I was saying about, if you had… What I said was true. If you had to rank them, from least funny to funniest assassination, easy, number one. Really. He’d be talking shit, like, when it happened, he’d be doing like a rally, “My opponent’s gay. I walked in, I saw him, I said, ‘Wow, this guy’s gay.’ ” The shooter would be coming out, “Sit down. You’re gay.” Get hit. He’d definitely make a funny noise into the… Like, he’d get hit, fall funny. I will say, I did write that joke before Biden could be added to the rankings. I don’t think he would be the funniest, but the only reason Biden might be the funniest is because I think Biden’s the first president you could punch assassinate. You know what I mean? Just walk right up through the metal, “Texas, Mr. President, the hell are you doing, dude?” It’s a body shot. [Laughter] I’d add that joke… My dad’s… “He can’t be talking about killing presidents.” What about body… Music. My dad’s… He’s a good guy. He’s an alcoholic, but he’s good. He’s like a good alcoholic. He’s not hurting anybody. But everyone’s, he’s always got an excuse for why he’s drinking. That’s what’s funny about it. Like, he can never just get hammered and be like, “Yeah, I got f*cked up.” It’s always like, “You’ll see him on like a Monday, you’ll be like, ‘Damn, it’s Monday, you’re getting f*cked up?’ He’s like, ‘It’s Monday Night Football. Have a couple of drinks, geez.'” You’ll see him on like a Tuesday, you’ll be like, “Damn, it’s Tuesday, you’re getting f*cked up?” He’s like, “It’s Tuesday. There’s no football.” [Music] What the hell. And my sister does heroin, and uh, and that one, we’re like, “You do need to stop doing that.” Which sucks for her because if she played guitar, everybody would be like, “She’s a genius.” Instead, she’s a hairdresser, so it’s not as cool. Relax, it’s my family. It’s my family. Don’t worry about it. Actually, based on this crowd, I’m sure it’s actually a lot of your guys’ families too. And that’s all right. We’re allowed to talk about it. My sister, since she was doing heroin, we had to have an intervention for her. She lived out in Pittsburgh. We live in the middle of Pennsylvania. So we had to trick her to come home. You got to trick them. I don’t know if you know these guys, they’re not just f*cking stopping by. They’re very busy. They’re the busiest people. They get a bad rap for being lazy because they take a lot of naps. But if they’re awake, they’re f*cking…very busy. They’re scurrying around, dude, doing quests. That’s what they do. If you do heroin long enough, you run out of money. You got to start doing quests. You know, it’s… You know, it’s like a f*cked up game of Zelda every day. You just wake up to a new quest. It’s like, “You need to gather coppers. Gonna find a scrap yard.” It sounds nice. I wish I got quests. But eventually, the quests get pretty dark. Scrapyard, that’s like level one. Towards the end, the quest, you need to get titty behind the Home Depot. [Laughter] It’s when it’s time for a change. So we had to come up with a plan to trick her to come home for the intervention. The plan we came up with was we told her that we had won tickets to go to Six Flags. And it worked. She called back, she’s already, “Alright, I’ll be there.” Just got on the first bus. It’\",\n",
       "  \"s like a seven-hour bus ride. There’s nothing to them, dude. No, if you take heroin, every bus is a bullet train. It’s a five-minute ride, tops. Anyway, so the plan was, pick my sister up from the bus stop, not take her to Six Flags. They could take her to a hotel, where we’re gonna have an intervention. I didn’t want to start the intervention with like a lack of trust, so I took her to Six Flags the day of her intervention. The morning of that day, she and I went to Six Flags together. And I thought that was a nice gesture, but it turns out an intervention is supposed to be rock bottom. You know what I mean? Like, an intervention’s supposed to be the worst day of your life, not like you’re tired from easily the best day humanly possible. I mean, she took heroin and rode roller coasters. It was… Dude, it was impossible. We sat down with her, like, “You better\\xa0 f*cking change your life.” She’s like, “I’m going back tomorrow.” And I was with her. She was… She was f*cked up. If you know anyone from Pittsburgh, you know what she was wearing. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Steelers pajama pants. She dusted off her finest Hines Ward for the occasion. [Laughter] So we get in there, there’s a water park there. We didn’t know they added that. We haven’t been there since we were kids. We get in there, there’s one of those water slides, it’s just like a f*cking straight drop. No sides on it, no raft, just by yourself. She looks at it, she’s like, “I wanna go up on that one.” I was like, “Yeah, alright, yeah, f*ck it… you know, I knew she was going to rehab like that night, so I was like, ‘Yeah, get this one in. You’re gonna have a rough couple of months here.'” Also, I figured they would stop her. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants, trying to get on a water slide. All they did was make her take her f*cking crocs off. Her yellow crocs. So she’s climbing up this ladder, she gets to the top of this f*cking giant water slide. You like when it’s your turn next on a water ride, you got to lay there in that water and wait to go? She nodded off. She took a nap, up at the top, like a Dracula, laying in front of some high school lifeguard that’s like, “Uh, ma’am, it’s your turn.” He just sent her down, asleep, just flying down this thing, dude. There’s a ramp at the end. She hit it, and we all got to watch her wake up in mid-air. She did the whole f*cking… I don’t know how that wasn’t f*cking rock bottom. So, you woke up in mid-air. Anyway, don’t be sad about it. She’s good. She did go to rehab, and that’s good. Yeah, she’s done. She stopped using. She’s sober. She’s all good. Two years clean. [Applause] Yeah, yeah, it’s good. She did… Uh, she did get cancer, though. So… And COVID. Cancer and COVID. So, I’ll tell you what, this was cool. I got… I was with her. I was with her. She was at home. She went back to my parents’ house because when you have cancer and COVID, you got to go home. You can’t keep hanging out. But no, I was with her. It was crazy. She… This year, she beat heroin, cancer, and COVID. It was like living with Rocky. It was crazy, dude. Every week, my whole family was like, “Give up. You’re never gonna win this.” She’s like… Just kept winning. When she got COVID, I was like, “Alright, you’re definitely dead.” “I ain’t hear no bell.” Just wailed on it, dude. Yeah, she’s got a hell of a chin. A hell of a chin on my sister. And what better quality could you ask for in a human? Anyway… Damn, dudes. F*ck that music across the street, dude, that f*cking bo\",\n",
       "  'thers me. I’m an old man now. “Turn it down. Okay, now what is that? Rap? Turn it off. Gotta talk about my sister doing heroin over here!” This has been making me laugh. I’ve been thinking about like the first time, uh… Like, uh, Jesus Christ. I do comedy a lot, and every once in a while, you can hear music from another room. And it’s like, “Damn, dude, music’s so much better.” Every time I hear music, I’m like, “F*ck dude, that crushes what I do.” Some idiot dressed like Cam Newton pressing play. It’s so much better than this. You guys want to hear about my problems? This guy’s like, “Take Molly, finger someone. I’m gonna press play. You guys do you.” F*ck they’re having so much fun over there. Get the f*ck out of here, go dance. I knew you wanted to dance. That guy wanted to dance all night. Alright, I like my family. It’s a good family. I had to go to my niece’s 7th and 8th grade girls’ volleyball match recently. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding, dude. Shut up. Just relax. I don’t want to f*ck kids, but if you ever want to get out of something, that’s all you have to do. Like, if your friend’s like, “Do you want to come to our son’s T-ball game?” Be like, “What grade are the kids in?” And then, no matter what they say, go, “Fourth?” [Laughter] No, I went to this f*cking kids’ volleyball match. Can we knock it off with volleyball shorts on little kids? It’s weird. It’s gross, dude. Just get them gym shorts. That’s all. No, dude, it’s gross because then, you know, it’s just me and the other uncles up in the… up in the bleachers, kind of making eye contact with each other like, “Bro, are you seeing this?” [Laughter] Such a funny way to just destroy a show, just right at the very end, be like, “Aren’t kids hot? Yo, give it up for Trump. Aren’t kids hot?” No, I am. I truly am serious about the gym shorts, though. It’s weird. And so I got home from this f*cking volleyball match. My roommate, his girlfriend played college volleyball. So I’m very excited to, like, shit on volleyball whenever I can. So I get in there, and I was like, “Yo, volleyball is f*cking…, that’s a weird culture. Get them f*cking shorts. Get them gym shorts. The shorts they’re wearing is gross.” And she was like, “No, we need those shorts for speed on the court.” And I was like, “Uh, I know that’s not true. I watched the NBA. None of you are moving as fast as like a ref, and those guys are wearing like slacks, dress shoes, for some reason.” She was like, “No, we need those shorts. The tight shorts, they’re essential.” She compared them to like a helmet in football. I was like, “I know they’re not essential because I Googled the Special Olympics volleyball team.” [Laughter] All of a sudden, those shorts weren’t so essential for them. What’s that about? How baggy do you think they’re… They look like the f*cking AND1 Mixtape out there. Offensively baggy is how I would describe all of their attires. [Laughter] We’re all adults. We can… This, we all agree the Special Olympics is a good… It’s a good program. I just… It’s great. I just feel like the guy who came up with it had to be like a real risk-taker. You know what I mean? That’s a wild thing to suggest for the first time. Some guy in a board meeting like, “I got an idea. We should be racing these motherf*ckers.” Like, “What’d you say?” “Uh, town over said that they’re the fastest ones. Say we settle it, you know?” I’m not making fun of the Olympians. The concept is wild. It’s a wild, like, if your best friend invented the Special Olympics and told you about it first, y',\n",
       "  'ou’d be like, “Don’t ever tell anybody that. Who the f*ck are you going to tell that to? What are you doing? Pole vault?” [Laughter] I actually, personally, I actually volunteered and coached with the Special Olympics for a little while. So, you know what? You guys do… No, don’t clap, please. I did it for those kids. [Applause] I look like this, so me coaching the Special Olympics, I was like a f*cking double agent. No one knew whose side I was on, dude. Player, chaperone, no one knew. I’d be standing there coaching, holding a clipboard, with five dudes that looked exactly like me. I always see the coaches from the other team looking over like, “I think they got… I think they’re f*cking letting one of them coach.” Yeah, no, I did coach the Special Olympics for a little while. And it’s fun. That’s another thing, you’re allowed to talk about it. It’s happy, everyone there’s sportsmanship. It is funny. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not funny, dude. I was there. Everyone there is laughing. It’s fun. I coached basketball. Kids would catch the ball, just launch it into the bleachers. People be like “What the f*ck are you doing out there?” My whole team ruled. Everybody, every dude on my team, they were the funniest. They were bros. They’re bros, dude. My whole team loved two things: they love tits, they do. I don’t know if you know these guys, dude. They f*cking love the ladies. And they love John Cena. That’s it. That was the news every day. We’d be in the huddle, they’d be like, “A lot of ladies here tonight.” I was like, “Yeah.” They’d be like, “What do you think John Cena is up to?” “Oh, you’re gonna have to get way worse before you meet him.” See, he’s just like the angel of death for those guys. I told my guys, I was like, “You see Cena coming, you get the f*ck out of there. He’s taking souls with him.” [Laughter] Every year, Hooters would sponsor our one basketball tournament. Alright? So, every year, Hooters would bring like three or four waitresses, and they would present like a big cardboard check donation to the Special Olympics. As soon as the girls entered the gym, the game changed entirely, dude. It went from like hugs and sportsmanship to just like dudes got competitive. Like very competitive. F*cking ripping down rebounds, just hitting layups. [Laughter] And then at the end of the game, there’d be a hug line, you know, between the waitresses and the players. And yeah, that went about exactly how you would imagine that went. We had to break out the f*cking jaws of life, dude. My boys, my boys were ragging on those young sluts. And I’m not knocking the players. They were totally in the right. The girls were hot. The waitresses, like every year, I would sneak into the hug line myself. Alright, I think I’m going to get out of here, guys. Thank you guys very much. This was a lot of fun. Thank you. [Applause] [Music] * * * \\n Your email address will not be published.

       " ['In his stand-up comedy special Live at the Lodge Room, Stavros Halkias delivers a raucous and candid performance, touching on a wide range of personal experiences and observations. He starts by humorously recounting his weight fluctuation during the pandemic, blending self-deprecation with sharp social commentary. Halkias then navigates through topics like the generational differences between millennials and baby boomers, the absurdities of everyday life, and the complexities of relationships and sexuality. His storytelling is both vivid and relatable, as he candidly shares tales of his struggles with sobriety, his adventures in dating, and his experiences as the son of immigrant parents. Halkias’ delivery is unapologetically honest and often outrageous, serving up a mix of poignant reflections and laugh-out-loud moments that explore the human condition with a blend of empathy and irreverence. Stav’s debut special was recorded at the Lodge Room in Los Angeles, 2022. * * * * * * [announcer] Coming to the stage now, the people’s champ, the crown prince of Baltimore. Please put your hands together for Stavros Halkias! Alright. Hell yeah. Alright. L.A. How we doing, gang? Huh? F*ck yes. Oh. Thank you for coming out. F*ck with your boy. How do I look, huh? Stop. Stop. Come on. You know, you know I had to come out here looking like a f*cking sidequest boss on GTA. I’ll have you motherf*ckers selling pornography all across San Andreas. Yeah. I’m happy to be out, man. I really am. It’s nice to be out and about. This is cool, being in a packed show again, you know? Sucked being indoors for, like a whole year, you know? Although, I have to admit, I had a pretty productive pandemic. I’m not gonna lie. I lost 50 pounds during the pandemic. Ehh? Thank you. Yeah. That was, that was during the second half of the pandemic. During the first half, I gained 45 pounds. So I kind of took the scenic route to losing five pounds. Yeah, dude. I was f*cked as soon as it happened. There was no chance. There was no chance I wasn’t gonna get fat as hell. You know what I mean? Yeah, because it was a scary time, right? We’re all, you know, we’re cooped up, we’re anxious, we don’t know what’s gonna happen. And I’m a very emotional eater, you know? Like I use food as drugs. But I also use drugs as drugs. You know what I mean? Like you shouldn’t be able to eat a whole pizza on cocaine, but. I’m five for five, you know what I mean? I power through every time. Yeah. Remember the first part of the pandemic where it was all Tiger King and online shopping? Remember? Where it was like, I swear to God, If this f*cks up Cinco de Mayo, I’m gonna be pissed. Remember that? I got fat as hell during that part. And I was f*cked up the whole time. I was just taking edibles like they were birth control, you know? Like an alarm would go off on my phone. I’d be like, Whoa! Time for 90 milligrams. Jeez, I almost had a thought today. That, that was a close one. I almost reflected today. It didn’t help that they made you feel like a hero for ordering takeout, by the way. Remember that? Every commercial’s like, Support your local restaurants. We need you right now. It’s like, Oh my God. Well, if called upon, I will serve. Hello? Yes. More lo mein. FAST. Hurry. We have to combat the xenophobia the Chinese are up against right now. More dumplings. I have to stop Asian hate. I have to stop Asian hate by almost stopping my own heart. That’s how it’s gonna happen. Yeah, I thought I was gonna die for a year in a row. Because I felt like sh*t. I would check the symptoms and I don’t know if you realized this, but the symptoms are just being fat. That’s it. That’s what they describe dude, right? Like every symptom’s like, have you ever had shortness of breath? Aches and pains? Or diarrhea? It’s like, every day since I’m nine years old. What do you mean? I had COVID in third grade, is that what you’re saying? Even loss of taste. Yeah, I’ve burned my mouth on a Hot Pocket before. Yeah, everyone young— I’m 32. I feel like me, everyone me and under. We’re f*cked. You know, it’s, millennials and under, we’re f*cked, right? We’re the first generation that’s gonna do worse than our parents statistically. You know what I mean? Which sucks. But the worst part is that our parents think it was because they were so smart. You know what I mean? That, I can’t stand that. I’m tired of hearing it from baby boomers. Right? Like their lives were so easy. You could just win a house at a carnival back then. You know what I mean? Just some guy, like. Oh. Nice. A three-bedroom. Awesome. Honey, we’re moving again. Yeah, have you ever ',\n",
       "  'tried to get advice from them about a job? They’re like, Well, did you look him in the eye and shake his hand? And it’s like, Yeah. I did that. Like, Huh? Well, that’s how I became the vice president of Circuit City. So I’m— I’m out of ideas. They all think we’re children too. These millenials spending all their money on lollipops. It’s like, okay, I need a CPAP machine, actually, but. And these lollipops have weed in them, by the way. So a little more expensive than you might think. Yeah. Sucks. They ruined the world. Global warming. That’s them, right? Not for anything good either. I think it was mostly hairspray, right? That’s it. Like every Bon Jovi concert took a centimeter off the polar ice caps, I’m pretty sure. Like, Oh, now I have to f*cking wash my yogurt cups. Why? Why? You wanted a Jheri curl so I have to rinse out garbage now? How is that fair? They ruined drunk driving. That was them, right? Come on. You know how fun that would be right now? Know what I’m saying? F*cking, get on one of those electric scooters four Truly’s deep. That would be sick. But no, somebody couldn’t handle their Quaaludes, so. But the good news is sh*t is only gonna continue to get worse. So we’re going to be able to do that to our kids. Right? I can’t wait to flex on my children. Right? Just talking to my adult son like, Hey, buddy, come on, you’re 30 years old. You can’t be splitting a tent with six people anymore. Alright? When I was your age, I only had one roommate, and I owned my Nintendo switch. So you got, you got a lot of growing up to do, pal. Okay? Go get a job selling your plasma just like everybody else. Oh, I need to be patient with you? You tell me about patience when you’ve jacked off to a dial-up internet connection, okay? When you’ve accidentally busted to a forehead that was still loading. Then we can talk about patience. When you have printed out a picture of WWE superstar Trish Stratus on an inkjet printer to jack-off to later. Then we can talk about patience. Now quiet down. The Boston Dynamics robot might hear us. Yeah. There’s no like part of the bit where I’m like, But you know what? If we all stick together, we— No I think we’re f*cked. Unless somebody, you know, shmassassinates Shmeffrey Shmezos. I didn’t say it. Legally, I didn’t say anything. You can’t get me legally. Yeah, we’re f*cked. Like that guy gets to just go to the moon and this guy will never see a doctor in his life. You know what I mean? Yeah. But hey, whatever. Just get us sucked off as possible. That’s what I think. Yeah. Focus on yourself, you know? Have some goals. Improve yourself. Have a good time. I got goals. I got stuff I want to improve. Right? I want to keep losing weight. You know, that’s one of my goals. For a lot of reasons. though, you know? Number one, I’m tired of being fetishized. You know, that’s. Not sexually but platonically. You know? ‘Cause people look at me and they think, Oh, Oh, there’s a big fat party animal. Right? But that’s a lot of pressure, you guys. You know what my Hawaiian shirt budget is? It’s crazy. You think I only want to do cannonballs? No. I want to do other dives, you guys. But everybody expects a certain thing from me, it hurts my feelings. I had a real fat boy pet peeve happen to me the other day. I dropped a slice of pizza on the ground and enough people saw me that I had to throw it away. That— Oof. That was tough. Oh, boy. Just gonna take this to the trash. Of course. That’s where I was going. That’s where I’d be going if you weren’t here. That’s for sure. Definitely wouldn’t be eating this with 10% less enthusiasm. Yeah. I had another moment happen where it was, like, really showed me I need to get back in the gym a little bit, you know? Like I was taking the steps on the subway and I fell down the steps, and none of the Black teens around me made fun of me. They were all just concerned for my well-being. Do you know how much that stings? To be too fat for the scorn of Black teens? It’s like, No, come on, man, don’t call me sir. Take your phone out. Record me! Make me feel alive. They wouldn’t do it, dude. They were just good Samaritans, it broke my heart. Yeah. I don’t know. It’s not just weight loss, though. I got other sh*t I wanna work on. I want to grow— I’m 32. I feel like I should grow up a little bit, you know? Like, I feel like this is the year. No more floor pills, right? No more finding loose pharmaceuticals on the ground, and trying to get f*cked up off what turns out to be heartburn medicine. Like that’s over for me. I am trying to stay sober, though. That’s real. I’m trying to stay sober. It’s been about four ',\n",
       "  'weeks, you know? Four weeks since— Alright. Thank you. Yeah. It’s alright, I’ll be back. Don’t worry. After this show, I’ll be back. If I’m being honest with you guys. Yeah, I just had to cool my jets for a sec. It’s hard, man. I— My problem with sobriety is I keep doing drugs, you know? Because drugs rock, right? Here’s how good drugs are. You know what my favorite movie of all time is? It’s this nature documentary about tropical fish that I watched on mushrooms at my friend’s place. And the colors were so vibrant and the story was so gripping. Halfway through, I’m like, Dude, what is this? I got to look this up. And he looks at me and goes, You are watching a screensaver right now. It’s like, Hm. Okay. Well, don’t touch the mouse, please. I’m rather invested in this right now. I’d like to see how this ends. Thank you. I’m trying to stay sober. I’m trying to watch less porn, trying to be off porn. One of my friends, he was off porn, too. I was like, Sick, dude, what’s your secret? Let’s compare notes. And he was like, Oh, I’ve just been having sex with a lot of women. It’s like, Okay, man, that’s not being off porn, right? You can’t be like, No more video games for me. No more Madden. I’m just on the Dallas Cowboys now. No more Call of Duty. I bought a gun, so. Take this for a spin. Yeah. I keep trying to improve year by year. You know, I was real depressed a few years ago when I first moved to New York. Things were tough, you know? And I was venting to a friend, and they tried to cheer me up. They’re like, Dude, you shouldn’t be depressed. If child-you could see what your life is like, he’d be thrilled. It’s like, really? That’s the metric we want to use? That a child wants my life? It’s like, yeah, he does, but for the wrong reasons, right? He’s like, Hey, what’s life like? Will there be ice cream? There’ll be ice cream every day. Sometimes for breakfast. For breakfast? Won’t that taste weird when you brush your teeth? You’re not— You’re not doing that that much anymore. Oh, really? Will there be sleepovers? Will I see my friends? You’re gonna live with four of your friends. Every day is a sleepover that you can’t escape. Oh, that rules. I hope no girls come and ruin it. I would not worry about that one right now. That last one is not gonna be an issue, unfortunately. No, that’s an old joke. I f*ck, of course, but. Things were tough. I’m not going to lie to you. Yeah. When I first moved to New York, I didn’t have my own room. I had the corner of a large living room, and I’m glad I’m out of there. But there is something I miss about that. There’s a certain level of camaraderie that comes with that kind of poverty. You know? Like, I miss clowning your boy when you heard him bust too fast. You know what I mean? Because there was five of us in a three-bedroom. Everybody knew the exact tempo everybody else f*cked at in that apartment. There was nothing funnier than hearing that IKEA bed frame stop squeaking just a little too fast. You know? Letting out an audible laugh that cut through your paper-thin walls. Pretty soon, everybody’s joining in. Ha ha ha ha. It was nice. Yeah. I’m doing better now, though. You know? Things are pretty good. I grew up pretty poor. I was poor until pretty recently. And I’m not poor anymore. But I’m not rich either. What I am is the richest a poor person could ever imagine becoming. You know what I mean? Like, I’m get appetizers every time rich, you know? Like, it’s not just for birthdays anymore. I’m dipping sauce rich, a lot, a lot of my money is tied up in ranch right now. I’m big ass TV, No health insurance rich, right? I got Xbox and PlayStation, but no Blue Cross/Blue Shield. That’s. Yeah, I don’t know. I did do one smart thing. I did do one kind of like investment thing. I bought a house. That’s something, right, guys? Thank you. It’s in the sh*tty neighborhood I grew up in. I grew up in southeast Baltimore. Greektown. I grew up in season two of The Wire to tell you, basically. Pretty easy to get a house there. I’m not gonna lie to you. To give you an idea, when we moved in, one of our neighbors warned us that the other neighbor was gay. So. You get a little idea of what the property values are like over there. Right? And the way he did it was hilarious, too, because he was like, Listen. Good guy and everything, but watch out. For what? What am I watching out for? What is this man? Some kind of gay raccoon? You know what I mean? Like, Hey, buddy. You’re gonna want to lock your dicks up overnight, okay? Cover ’em, chain ’em up, bring ’em indoors. This man’s got a real nose for a penis. Alright? He will get to a cock',\n",
       "  ', I promise you that. Got me a couple times. Stay safe out there. Yeah, we got the best white trash in Baltimore, dude. Extra strength white trash. They got their own little dialect. You know? If you were talking to a guy that I grew up around, here’s how the conversation would go. It would be the dumbest thing you’ve ever heard, sounding horrible, but with the most confidence, right? It’s always some guy that’s like, Yo. You know what I don’t understand about traffic? Why don’t the guy in the front just go. Just f*cking go. That “oh” is brutal. It’s the trademark. It’s like a domestic abuse air raid siren. Ooooooh. Yo, I heard if you don’t pay child support for both your kids, that’s double jeopardy. They can’t get you on that one. You got to know your rights, brother. You got to know your rights. One of my friends overheard a guy in a 7-Eleven go, Damn it, Mikey spent all my sweatpants money on Doritos. What the f*ck does that mean? What could it possibly mean? Is the money in sweatpants? Is it for sweatpants? If it’s for sweatpants, why does your clothing cost as much as snacks? That’s my community, baby. Yeah, that’s— It’s a funny neighborhood, you know? It’s a bunch of those guys and then a bunch of, like, recent immigrants from South and Central America. And then a bunch of Greek people that are mad that immigrants are stealing their neighborhood. It’s a bunch of old Greek guys that are like, You know, they don’t even, they don’t even speak English. It’s like, Okay, man, you don’t speak English, right? What’s the issue? Yeah. It was a fun little immigrant upbringing over there. Any immigrants here? Yeah. Yeah? Nice. Where you from? Mexico. Mexico. Nice. Classic. Does that count here? Like this is Mexico, right? Like, it should be Mexico. But do you like your parents? Yeah. Yeah? Both of them? Both of them. Both? You don’t like one more than the other? The mom more than the dad. The mom more than dad. When’s the last time you and your dad hugged? Uhhh… We got him. Nah, it’s all good, dude. For me, me and my dad, It was the last time Greece got to the quarterfinals of the World Cup. That was— Yeah. Yeah. I don’t know if you guys know this. I don’t know if this is your experience, but immigrants, one of their favorite parenting techniques is child abuse. I don’t know if you guys knew that. Like, my dad didn’t hit us that much, but his go-to move was this, was just like. Do your f*cking homework. And to this day, he’ll be like, Well, come on, I never hit you. And it’s like, Yeah, but you always could have, you know? Never really felt off the table, Pops. I had a lot of friends from similar backgrounds. You know, I think you kind of attract that. And, you know, one of my buddies, we, we became really close later in life, and he’s still one of my best friends today. But when we were first friends, he was like opening up to me, you know? He was confiding in me and he was like, Yeah, dude. My dad used to just get f*cked up off wine coolers and beat the sh*t out of me. And, I knew it shouldn’t have tripped me up, but I was like, I’m sorry, dawg. You said wine coolers? Yeah. I just knew when I came home and I saw that daiquiri mix in the freezer I was in for a long night of being whipped with maraschino cherry stems. I didn’t get a lot of lessons from my dad. I’ll be honest. I didn’t, you know, he didn’t teach me a lot of stuff. I didn’t get a sex talk even. You know? The closest I got to a sex talk was one time, we were in Greece, and he was watching pornography just in the living room. Not, not in his chambers. Right? And it’s a James Bond-themed porno. And when James Bond starts getting sucked off, my dad looks at me. He’s like, Ehh? F*ckin’ ehh. And that was my sex talk. Just watching a British man get head with my father. Yeah, I’ll give him some credit, though. He was a really good dad when I was a little kid, you know? And then I think when I was like 10 or 11, he had a heart attack and he had one of those, like, near-death experience, moments of clarity. He was like, Oh my God, what have I been doing with my time on Earth? I have to start cheating on my wife. I can’t. I can’t be a present father. I have to buy a leather jacket from Costco and get pussy. Yeah, he cheated on my mom, and I don’t know how. Right? Like, if you’re some sexy rich guy, I get it. I don’t condone it, but I see what happened. What happened with my dad? Did some woman look at him and go, Oh, my God. When I saw that hunched-over Greek contractor take a piece of loose salami out of his pocket and eat it while laughing at a man in a wheelchair, I knew I had to have him. The w',\n",
       "  'ay his shoulder hair waved in the wind. Yeah. I don’t know. I’ve been going to therapy, though. You know? Any therapy heads in the building? Nice. What’s your biggest trauma? I’m kidding. No, I’m just a little light crowdwork, huh? No, I’ve been going to therapy a bunch, and I have empathy for my dumbass dad, you know? That suck, you know? Seeing it from his side, you know? Because, look, was he the best dad in the world? No. But did he do his best? Also no. But, you know, whatever, he gave it a hot 65%. He did— I’ll give him credit again. He gave me a better childhood than he had, right? That’s really all you can ask on some level. Like his family was all f*cked up. Here’s how my dad’s parents met. Right? This is Greece in the forties, right? It’s still arranged marriages. And no one in my grandfather’s village wants to marry him. Nobody. Doesn’t matter how many goats they throw in the trade. No one’s biting, right? No one in mainland Greece will marry him, which is actually kind of impressive, right? Like there’s no Internet. This is word of mouth spreading about what a piece of sh*t he is, right? Basically, what they end up doing is they catfish a family on an island eight hours away. Right? There’s no way for them to meet before the wedding. They do the deal through letters. Finally, it’s set. Everything’s good to go. They take this eight-hour boat ride out to this woman’s island. And the second my grandfather steps off the boat, the woman he’s supposed to marry looks at him and goes, No, absolutely not. I’m not, I’m not marrying this guy. And then her dad goes, Oh, geez, well, you came all this way. Why don’t you marry my other daughter? And those are my grandparents. That’s them. Wild, right? Have you had like a bad Craigslist roommate? And you’re like, Oh, once this lease is up, I am out of here. Imagine if that lease was your whole life and that roommate creampied you because that, that was my grandma’s life. And, yeah. You’d think something like that would make somebody a bitch. And you would be correct in this instance, actually. I feel bad and everything, but really a tough hang. I’ll be honest with you guys. I went to visit her actually on her deathbed, and she had pretty bad dementia by the time I got to see her. And I’m trying to communicate with her. And she just looks at me and she goes, Who are you? You got fatter. It’s like, okay, pick one. Okay? Either you don’t know who I am or you don’t know I got fatter. That’s how that works. But I got to hand it to her. You know, she snuck one in right at the buzzer. Three, two, one. You’re fat. [buzzer sound] One of the best to ever do it folks. Hang her moomoo up in the rafters. I like my family though. They are pretty funny. My mom’s mom is funny too. My grandma on the other side. She’s great. She’s very accepting, but very ignorant at the same time. Which is a really funny combo. Like over the holidays, a couple of years ago, we watched this old Greek movie, and one of the characters, it’s revealed, thinks Jews drink blood, you know? And it’s like an old movie. He’s the village idiot. It’s obviously a joke. Everyone’s making fun of him. Everybody’s laughing. I look at my family, they’re laughing. I look at my grandma. She’s like, confused. I am like, Oh, Grandma, isn’t this hilarious? This guy thinks Jews drink blood. And she’s like, Well, yeah, but. They do, right? But the way she said it was, And you shouldn’t judge other people’s cultures, Stavros. What? You think Jews are vampires? But we should let it slide for diversity reasons? Incredible perspective, yia-yia. She’s great. But I will say, the more time I spend around Greek people, the more time I think it’s crazy the kinds of immigrants we’re banning in this country. You know, like it should be us, right? Like, we got enough Europeans, right? Like a racist might be like, Oh, well, we can’t have refugees from the Middle East. What if they commit sex crimes? It’s like, okay, well, have you ever met an Italian man? Have you ever tried to purchase pizza in this country one time? Hey, bella, how old you are? That guy’s getting waved through customs. Why? F*ck. You know how Inuit people have, like, 30 words for “snow” in their language? Italian is similar in that they don’t have a single word for “consent” in theirs. No, I shouldn’t sh*t on Italians. I’m Greek. We’re basically Italians that peaked in high school, right? We’ve been coasting on democracy for quite some time now. It is a gorgeous place, though. I do love visiting over there. It f*cking rocks. I remember I took a visit there a couple of years ago with my girlfriend at the t',\n",
       "  'ime. And when you take an international trip like that with somebody, you learn a lot about each other. We’re gone for 10 days, just me and her. And what we learned is that we did not want to be together anymore. That was the big takeaway for us. Kind of tough, I’ll be honest with you, to break up on vacation, you know? That’s not how you see your chase Chase Sapphire Rewards going, you know? You ever paid $3,000 to be the saddest you’ve ever been? It was my fault, though. I took a rich girl on vacation. Right? Rich people don’t give a f*ck about vacations. Poor people, could you imagine breaking up on vacation? The only good week of your life? You’re not. You’re not doing that. But don’t get me wrong. She wasn’t like evil rich, right? She’s not space-for-fun rich. But I’ll put it this way. When the shampoo ran out in her home, they just threw the bottle away. Right? There was, there was no filling it with water and living off bubbles for a week, you know? She never had sh*tty bubbles hair. Right? There were no omelets for dinner, you know? Like, Whoa, hot dogs again? Mom’s the coolest! No buddy. Mom is not that cool. These are struggle dogs right here. We got to make these last till dad’s disability check comes in. Yeah, I don’t know if you know this, but making a pack of Hebrew Nationals last eight days, that’s actually white trash Hannukuh. Thanks. You know, it was a good relationship while it lasted. I’m not bitter. You know, things end. And we had a good time. We had a good sex life. You know, we were really into roleplaying. Anybody here? Roleplay? Nice. What do we do? Huh? Say it again. —Um, like schoolgirl. Schoolgirl. Classic. Very nice. Yeah, that’s good. Is this like teacher/schoolgirl or just like schoolgirl? Schoolgirl/schoolgirl. Schoolgirl/schoolgirl? Now we’re talking. Wow. A twist on an old classic. The Bud Light Lime of roleplaying. Nice. Hell yeah. I really like roleplaying because I always pick a guy that comes really fast. That’s my, that’s my character, is a guy that busts quick and then plays NBA2K for like a half hour. I really commit to that one. I’m sort of a method actor when it comes to that one. Yeah. I could tell, though, in hindsight that that relationship was kind of losing some steam. You know? I think you can tell in the way you initiate sex when the passion starts to go. You know, like when we first started dating, we’d go on these long dates, we’d talk for hours, there’d be a spark, we’d kiss. I’d be like, Wow, this is really gonna happen. The way I knew we were gonna have sex at the end of the relationship is, if I went to the bathroom and she was like, Wash your hands with soap this time! Like, hell yeah dude. Nice. Why’s she want ’em clean, huh? She’s not trying to get crumbs in there. That’s why. I’m about to have sex. It was good, though. I did— I learned a lot about myself being in a long-term relationship, you know? Like I learned I’m more traditional in some ways than I realize, even though I consider myself a feminist overall. You know? Like, do I want my girlfriend to shave her legs? Yes. But I will allow her to support me financially. So I’m sort of a modern guy in that sense. Thank you. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Please. I’m just doing my part. Nah, I’m a feminist, though. You know, that part’s real. And I think my, my favorite part of feminism is the concept of mansplaining, you know, because basically that means men aren’t allowed to explain anything anymore, which means I could just be dumb as hell. Right? Like, if one of my friends, if she’s like, Hey, what’d you think of this book? I’d be like, Hm, nice try. I see what you’re up to, but I’m not reading anymore. I’m a feminist. Thank you very much. Yeah, but anyway, that relationship’s over. It’s been over for a while. I’ve just been out there. Just a fat little slut. Just f*cking— Thank you. Just toss this little weiner around town, you know what I mean? Just throwing this five-and-three-quarters everywhere, you know? Six on its tippy toes. Don’t worry. Was this summer as slutty as you guys thought it was gonna be? No, right? It wasn’t that good, right? Pissed me off. I was f*cking ready, dude. Everyone was building it up. Everyone was like, We’ve been locked up for a year. People are going crazy. They’re going to be sucking and f*cking in the streets, you know? That was not my experience, I have to be honest. I think what happened is everyone was very excited. Everybody was like, went out one time, got crazy, f*cked, and then looked around, and was like, This sh*t’s still pretty bad out here, actually. The president just has a different kind of dementia now.',\n",
       "  ' No one’s really fixed anything, but there’s less funny tweets now. Yeah. I was pissed. I was ready for this horny summer. Right? I grew my hair out for this sh*t, you know what I mean? I was bald when the pandemic started. I was like, F*ck it, let’s see what happens. I’m trying to get my sh*t tugged on, you know what I mean? But it didn’t happen, dude. I had big plans. I was going to get pegged by somebody’s wife on a hammock, you know? Some big naturals on my shoulders. But the best laid plans of mice and men. You know what I mean? I was having this conversation with my gay friends, right? I was talking about the summer and I was complaining and they’re like, What do you mean? You don’t have sex? We’re having sex all the time. That’s not fair, you guys. A gay guy making fun of a straight guy for not having enough sex, is like a Harlem Globetrotter making fun of an NBA player for not scoring enough points, you know? It’s like, Come on, man. No one plays defense in your league, right? A lot of, lot of showmanship. Yeah, a lot of confetti. But not a lot of fundamentals, is all I’m saying. Yeah, I don’t know, though. I’m 32. You know, maybe it’s time I started doing some gay sh*t, you know? Looks like fun, you know? Like no one’s ever come in my mouth, but I love an overeasy egg. How different could it really be? Be honest with yourselves right now. It’s probably pretty close. Throw a little Tabasco on the guy’s cock, you know what I mean? Take me to brunch, big dog. There’s some pissed off dudes in the crowd right now. Hard scrambled from now on! I will not have gay eggs! Nah, I don’t know. Maybe that’s a little far for me too, is uh, sucking a man off with hot sauce in my mouth. But I want to expand the sexual repertoire a little bit. You know, I want some new moves. I’ve been doing some different stuff. I’ve been doing the pineapple thing, you know? Supposed to make it taste better, but everybody hates it no matter how much pineapple I put in my foreskin. And I don’t— What? Just chunk after chunk. What am I doing wrong? That might be the stupidest thing I say tonight. Here’s my real move, though, you know, here. Here it is. Because I was always jealous when you’re hooking up with a girl, and then she puts your hair up, like, suggestively, and it’s like, Uh oh. You know what’s coming next. That’s why what I’ve been doing is when I’m hooking up with a girl and I’m about to go down on her, I take out a huge bib. Num num num num num num num. That’s my move. I better not hear about anybody in L.A. doing the bib. Okay? That’s mine. And you definitely cannot say “my compliments to the chef” afterwards. That ties it all together. But I’ve been out there. I’ve been dating a little bit. You know? I was dating mostly younger women, not on purpose. Just because no one my age wants to be with me, you know? Like I’m 32. Girls my age want, like, stability, you know, they want, like, a real job. Health insurance. I could get you mushrooms pretty easily, you know? Like, that’s a style of 30-year-old I am. I don’t know what an IRA is, but I have acid on me right now. Sometimes people are condescending if you date somebody younger. They’ll be like, Oh, I’m sure the conversation was very intellectually stimulating. And you know what? I’m very stupid. So, yeah, it was. I’m learning a lot from these girls, a lot about astrology, I’ll tell you that much. They love the stuff. Everyone’s pretty freaky now too, I realize. Everyone I feel like has to bust in a strange way, you know? Like a girl I was with recently wanted to be tied up and then also pretend she was sleeping. And it’s like, I could just go, you know what I mean? Like, if that’s what it’s going to take to f*ck me, I’ll head home. No hard feelings. I don’t want to sound like a prude. Right? I’m not trying to kink shame up here. Tying up’s fun. Even the sleeping, I guess I don’t have a problem with. My issue with that situation is that she has no use of her hands and I’ve never successfully had sex without the guiding vagina hand move. You know that move? Where the girl’s like an electrician trying to connect two wires. Just like a real— I 98% know where a pussy is, but that last 2% I really need help with. Yeah. I’m not that good at rough sex. I think it’s because I love my mom too much. She called me recently and she was like, Hey, how’s your love life going? It’s like, Not great, because of all the support you showed me as a child. Would it have killed you to miss a football practice every once in a while? I have no resentment towards women. I can barely choke this girl, mom. You’re embarrassing me right now.',\n",
       "  ' No, I’ll choke you, though. Don’t worry, I will. No problem. It’s not my favorite, but it’s fine. Some people, though, they love it, right? Some people, that’s how they have morning sex. That is crazy to me, right? There’s birds chirping outside. You’re smelling pancakes from next door. You’re just like— Come on, man. There’s a fresh morning dew outside. Children are going to school right now. Let “The Price Is Right” come on first. Show some decorum. Even dirty talk, you know? I feel like you’re doing me a really nice favor having sex with me. I don’t want to say a bunch of rude things to you, right? That’s not how you treat a bud doing a favor, right? Your friend helps you move. You’re not like, Yeah, get that ottoman, you little slut. Just putting my fingers in my friend Jeff’s mouth. Pick up the credenza, Jeffy. [spit sound] You little mover. Here’s another move somebody asked me to pull, was one of these, was just a choke-finger combo. You know, just like a real— Is that is that still sex, you guys? I got to be honest, it didn’t feel like sex. It felt like gynecology in the 1400s, you know? Like I felt like I was punishing a witch more than anything. It felt like we caught her learning how to read. For the crime of female literacy. Little Pilgrim hat. If she’s squirts, she’s a witch. Yeah. I’ve been out there, you know? I’ve been on some sexual voyages, you know? You know, I’ve had to f*ck my way out of a couple jams. Had a couple threesomes, Didn’t all go my way, I’ll be honest with you guys. Anybody here? A threesome? Yeah? How’d it go? —Uh, it went pretty well, I guess. Pretty well, you guess? Alright. Nice. Who were these people? —I got hit up on Tinder like four in the morning. You got hit up on Tinder. By a woman’s account? A man’s account? —Yeah, a woman surprisingly enough. A woman at 4 a.m. Alright, nice. Just out of the blue, they’re like, This is the guy I need. Huh? —She said, Do you want to have a threesome? Wow. —I did not think it was real. Sure. Of course. You’re like, yeah. You’re just like, alright, just check— Make sure my kidney is here the next morning. —It’s like a 30-minute Uber ride. —I was like, this might be it. That is— You weren’t getting too much pussy before, I’m guessing, right? They caught you in a drought. They caught you in a big dry spell. You’re like, I could die. It’s 4 a.m. I have to work in the morning. It’s $75 right now. But by gum, I might just get double sucked, so. And who are these women? What are they looking like when you get in? Do the pictures look similar? Wow. —Yeah. Wow. —It was all pretty cut and dry. All pretty cut and dry. Like you’re f*cking hanging, like you’re doing shingles on their roof. You’re like, Yeah. Wasn’t too much water damage? Everything was looking pretty good. Get in and out job. Alright. So how quickly until you’re in the house, is your penis breathing fresh air, would you say? —Like an hour and a half. Hour and a half? So you warmed up a little bit. That’s nice. —Except they wanted to make sure I wasn’t gonna kill them. —I was like, —Right. Yeah. —I’m the one that took an Uber ride —Sure, sure, sure. —30 minutes away. Wow, it’s a Mexican standoff. Okay. And then after they’ve vetted you for 90 minutes, they’re like, This is good. We can f*ck this guy. Okay. And then, is it good? Did everybody bust? —Just not me. Just not you? What? Get the f*ck out of here. The rare the guy doesn’t come in a two girls, one guy? They gave me a f*ckload of Adderall. They gave you Adderall? What the f*ck is going on? Wow. Respect to these girls. Did they give you dick pills and Adderall? That’s a f*cking dangerous combination. And you don’t bust and you’re just f*cking, you’re driving— You’re taking a f*cking 40-minute Uber home. You’re like— Dick on titanium, just— That was pretty cool. And you know what? That’s a fond memory for you, isn’t it? You’re gonna be on your deathbed just like smiling. Your grandchild is gonna be like, What is it, Papa? And you’re gonna be thinking about not busting to two, I’m gonna guess Maryland five and a halfs. There’s no way— There’s no way these were hot women, right? Everything we know we can kind of through echolocation understand they were ugly. And you’re going to be thinking about not coming with these women. Then you’re gonna look at him and be like, How much I love grandma. That’s— Nice, how about a nice hand for our friend over here, huh? Anybody else? Any other threesomes? This seems like a pretty— Over here. Raising your glass? Is that the I-had-a-threesome salute? How’d it go? —Not too well. Not too well? Yeah. By the way, shouts out a fellow ma',\n",
       "  'n of size, getting his dick sucked by two women. Who were these— What was the situation for you? —They looked like you. They looked like me. Alright. I don’t know why the f*ck I have to be disparaged in this. And you’re the one who f*cked them. I look like me. You f*cked two people that looked like me. How am I? How am I getting dragged into this? You couldn’t have said they looked like you? You know what I’m saying? Listen, we’re not too far off, pal. There’s a lot of different ways you could have phrased that that doesn’t throw me under the bus. Okay, so you were having a threesome in your weight class. It sounds like this was more of a wrestling match than a sexual encounter. Where did you meet these people? —Vegas. Vegas. Nice. Okay, so just three people down on their luck, just deciding to try to have a plus-sized threeway. That’s good. That’s good for the community. I like that. How many people came for you? —Only me. Only— Oh there we go. We’ve got the yin and yang of bad threesomes over here. I love it. Yeah. Mine was— Mine was closer to yours than his. But I’ll tell my story now. My threesome did not go good either. It was a surprise, first of all. I didn’t think it was gonna happen. And also, the day of my threesome, it started with a $40 Chinese food order. That was breakfast for me. You know what I mean? Just me, by the way. That’s $40 me. And it was one of those things where I was waiting. It was like, 10:59, 11. Hello? Yes, I’d like to— It’s like ordering Chinese food, like I’m waiting for Star Wars, you know? And so $40 Chinese food breakfast. There’s a real ceiling to your day when that’s how it starts, right? And I was also coming off the heels of a tender bender, which is when you have chicken tenders every day for two weeks in a row. Right? So I’m not where you need to be, nutritionally speaking, for a threesome, right? So I’m actually scrolling on Tinder and she’s gonna come to my show that night, but she’s bringing a friend. So in my mind, I’m like, okay, she’s coming to a public place. She’s bringing a friend, she wants to check out the vibes. And if you know, if the vibes are right, maybe we go on a date next week, just me and her. Maybe we f*ck next week, right? But there’s no sexual pressure on this situation. I just have to be a cute, charming little guy, and I think we all know how that’s gonna go. Right? So we get there and it’s a fun time. You know, the conversation is going really well. Her friend’s cool. She’s cool. And but, you know, like I said, I don’t think I’m gonna f*ck so I’m gonna keep eating, right? Because it’s one or the other, folks. I got a real problem. And so we’re chatting and I’m just f*cking eating like an asshole. I’m eating the way like a cartoon villain eats, you know what I mean? I’m just like, they’re talking just like sliders, like— You know? Just like a fish. The bones come out, like that situation. And it’s going good, but I’m getting sleepy because I’ve had a lot of carbs, right? And I’m about to talk to the girl I match with and be like, Hey, this was fun, let’s hang out some other time. But before I can make that pitch, I look over at them and they’re being really weird. They’re like texting each other. And I’m like, Hey, girls, what’s going on? And they’re like, Oh, nothing. We were thinking like, maybe we should all go back to my place and f*ck. And I was like, Yeah. Yes. Ha ha ha. Duh. That’s what I was also thinking. That’s what I am prepared for right now. But what am I gonna do? What, I’m gonna be like, My tummy hurts. I can’t get pussy. I had too many treats to get pussy tonight. I can’t do that. Right? So I’m like, F*ck it, I’m gonna thug this out. We’ll be fine. So we’re driving back to their place, right? And the whole time I’m doing this thing, I don’t know fellas if you’ve ever done this, where you try and make your dick hard with your mind. Have you ever done that? Just do a little check-in, I’m just in there like, Nothing. No movement whatsoever. Right? But I’m like, no big deal. I’m gonna get in this room. It’s gonna be me and four titties. I’m gonna be good to go. Right? And at first, I’m right. At first it rocks. I’m in there. Just me and four titties. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen— Have you seen one of those videos where they give a baby hearing aids for the first time? You ever, You ever see one of those? I’m just in there like— I’m having the time of my life, brother. It’s going awesome. But then, very quickly, the Chinese food comes back to haunt me, right? I just, I’m hitting them with dumpling dick, you know? Just think of a couple soup dumplings stacked on top of',\n",
       "  ' each other, you know? Very wobbly. Like, optically, I’m hard, but there is no structural integrity to my penis whatsoever. Yeah, it’s tough. I’m doing this movie a lot. I’m doing the okay sign. Have you ever done that? Where it’s like, Yeah, no, it’s hard. Uh huh, yeah. No, it’s hard. It’s actually definitely hard. Can you check? Can you check again? My dick is hard for sure. Like my credit card is getting declined. I’m like, Yeah, I called my bank. They said my dick was hard. So can you check? I’m blowing it, dude. I’m stalling for so— I’m eating pussy for so long. You could have just watched all of Rush Hour 2 the amount of time I’m eating pussy. One of them just falls asleep in the middle of it, you know? You know you’re not laying it down when you lose a participant mid-threesome, right? Yeah. I’m like, this is brutal. This is horrific. We got to end this. So I guess what I’m gonna have to do is jack off and leave. And that’s what I did. And in hindsight, it’s crazy that was my plan, right? Why the f*ck did I do that? Like, Oh, hey, girls, I’ve just been sexually disappointing you for two hours in a row. I’m gonna make a small mess in your home and get out of here. If that’s alright with you. And it was an angry one, too. It was one of those get the poison outs. You know? It was like a real, Aaaaah. I want to be free! So I do that and I’m just standing in this f*cking hallway dealing with a devastating bout of post-nut clarity. And I’m like, Wow, this is it. This is a tough L. This is the worst one of my life, probably. But you know what? That’s okay, because we can rebuild from this, right? It’s only up from here. This is rock bottom. So I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna f*cking rebuild my life like the, like the Phoenix, I’ll rise from these sexual ashes. Right? And that’s what I do. Eight months go by, my sh*t’s going great. My life’s going better and better and better. Things are going really good. And then out of the blue, I get a text from these girls and they’re like, Hey, want to f*ck again? And I’m like, This is a prank. Right? Like, I’m gonna get to their apartment. It’s just gonna be all my enemies, you know? Ha ha ha dude, we knew you couldn’t fuck. Ha ha ha. But that wasn’t, it was really them. They wanted to hook up again. And I wasn’t gonna ask too many questions, right? They had a whole little plan. You know, they had the day off from work. They were gonna go to the museum and then come over to my place after, which is a very European afternoon, you know? Like look at paintings and f*ck a fat guy with a little mustache. That’s, that’s Parisian, you know what I mean? And I had a plan too. I wasn’t going out the same way. This is redemption, you know what I mean? I’m f*cking hitting the elliptical. I’m f*cking drinking green juices. I’m drinking kombuchas. I buy $80 worth of illegal Indian Viagra off the Internet. Just from a guy that worked at a research lab. He was like, Yeah, just Venmo me and put “lunch.” Just comes in an unmarked vial. I’m just like, I take so much of it and my dick— it worked. My dick got hard as sh*t. But the rest of my body was failing, you know? Like, I was just f*cking and my joints were locking up. I’m just in there cold sweat, you know? Like the eyesight of my left eye is flickering like a light bulb in a haunted house. And I’m like, This is it. This is how I deserve to die. Is overdosing on dick pills. And if that’s how I went, I wouldn’t even want an open casket, you know? I would want a gloryhole casket, you know? Just everyone coming, paying their last respects, you know? He was such a good boy. Yeah. And so obviously the threesome wasn’t good, but there was one good part in the beginning, and that’s when I was I was eating pussy while getting my dick sucked. And it felt like I was sucking my own dick through a portal and that, that was the best moment of my life, I gotta be honest. Guys, thank you so much. That’s it. We did it. Hell yeah. Thank you.

       " [\"[upbeat music] [sentimental music] [announcer] Please welcome Taylor Tomlinson! [audience cheering] Thank you so much! [cheering] Thank you! Thank you, guys, so much! Thank you! I so, so appreciate you guys being here. It’s been a rough couple of years. I got bangs at one point. Shit got dark. [audience laughs] I didn’t even want bangs. I just needed people to check on me. And it works, by the way. You post a selfie in bangs, everybody’s like, “Fire emoji. You go, girl!” Then they text you, like, “You okay?” [audience laughs] Here’s what I did. I got bangs and then two days later, I did mushrooms for the first time. [audience laughs] And as soon as I did those mushrooms, I was like, “I should’ve done these first. [audience laughs] Probably wouldn’t have gotten these bangs if I forgave myself, huh?” [audience laughs] But you know what? Having bangs feels exactly like being on mushrooms. The whole time, you’re just looking at your friends, like, “Do I look weird? [audience laughs] You guys would tell me if I looked weird, right? Is it… Is it bad different? Is it not good… You know what? I changed my mind. I don’t want to do it. It’s too late? It’s already happening? Okay, no, I can be this person.” I got back into therapy. Anybody in therapy? [audience cheers] Mostly women. That’s the problem. [audience laughs] It’s very hard to stay in therapy. My old therapist told me that when I get close to people, I have a tendency to self-sabotage. And I thought that was bullshit, so I ghosted her. [audience laughs] And then… I finally went back because I finally dated enough people who all gave me the exact same feedback about my shitty personality. You know, that romantic quota you hit where you’re, like, [laughing] “Uh-oh! Might be me! [audience laughs] Oh, the reviews are in and they are [blows raspberry] unanimous. That’s a bummer.” So after a really bad breakup a few years ago, I finally took a long hard look at myself and said, “Okay, Taylor, five out of five dudes all think that in fights, you behave like a raccoon trapped in a trash bag.” [audience laughs] “So maybe it’s time to get some Klonopin or a rabies shot.” [audience laughs] I am fully medicated now. Anybody else? Anti-depressants? [audience cheers] Medication? Yeah. Nice. What are we on? Shout it out. [audience shouting indistinctly] Zoloft, Lexapro. Oh! Look at us. Gang’s all here! [audience laughs] Oh my God! I’m also on something. I would never say what, that’s very personal, but… [audience laughs] No, I’m kidding. I’m on a few things. I am on Klonopin as needed for panic attacks. I’m so glad I have Klonopin now because before I had medication for it, I would have panic attacks right when I had to be somewhere, which is the worst time to get them ’cause then you just have to pinch the panic attack off like a shit you don’t have time to take. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? When you’re, like, “Okay, I got 60% of that out of my system. [audience laughs] I’m not done but I gotta go to work. [audience laughs] I will get to the other 40 later or I’ll finish in the big stall at lunch if no one’s in there. [audience laughs] I got put on something else for sleep because I have night terrors. There’s no fun, casual way to say that. [giggles] “Wake up screaming and…” [audience laughs] These sleeper time pills I got are great. They don’t stop the nightmares but they do hold you down while they’re happening. [audience laughs] Which sounds bad but before, I’d wake up in the middle so afraid and now, I stay asleep until the nightmare’s natural conclusion, [audience laughs] which provides you with some closure. [audience laughs] You’re like, “Oh, he stabs me at the end. [audience gasps] Okay, plot twist, M. Nightmare Shyamalan.” [audience laughs] I thought I was on an anti-depressant. It turns out I’m not. It turns out I’m actually on a mood stabilizer that they use as an anti-depressant. Fun fact about prescription drugs. Everything they prescribe, they actually use for, like, four different things. So you don’t really know what your deal is until you find a combo that works and then Google all your pills by yourself. [audience laughs] So after years of trial and error, I finally found a combination of things that worked for me, and six months ago, I decided to Google it ’cause what the hell. And it turns out that everything I’m taking is primarily used for bipolar disorder. So I went back to my psychiatrist and I was, like, “Hey. [audience laughs] Do we think…?” [audience laughs] And she was, like, “Oh! Yeah!” [audience laughs] And I was, like, “Is this how you fucking tell people?” [audience laughs] And she’s, like, “No, of course not. We didn’t know. I’m glad we figured it out.” And I was, like, “We?” [audience laughs] I said, “You really didn’t know that I was bipolar?” And she goes, “No, of course not. We thought we were treating anxiety and depression.” And I said, “Okay. ‘Cause this kinda feels like a putting your dog’s medication in cheese situation.” [audience laughs] And I was, like, “I don’t know how I feel about this diagnosis.” And she goes, “Well, if it makes you feel better, you don’t have to say, ‘I am bipolar.’ You can say, ‘I have bipolar.'” [audience chuckles] Which feels a lot like someone going, “I said you were being a bitch.” [audience laughs] I’m so glad I know that I’m bipolar now. I mean, I have the right meds, I got a mood ring, I’m handling it. [audience laughs] But when I first found out, it was a very tough pill to swallow. And I’ve swallowed a lot of pills. [audience laughs] Because when you first find out something like that, you’re, like, “Oh man, am I gonna tell anybody? Should I tell anybody? And if I do tell people, am I hot and/\",\n",
       "  'or talented enough to be an inspiration?” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] Like, if I have a thing and someone else has that thing and they find out I have it too, are they gonna feel good or bad with that information? Because when I got diagnosed, they started listing names. They were, like, “You know who else is bipolar? Selena Gomez.” And I was, like, “That does make me feel better. [audience laughs] She is very pretty. [audience laughs] Okay, I’ll be bipolar.” [audience laughs] I did not grow up in a household that was very, like, mental health-conscious. Like, we were very religious. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to tell your conservative dad that you have a mental health issue. It doesn’t go great. When I was in high school, I was like, “Dad, I think I’m depressed.” And he was, like, “You just need some protein. Get a scoop of peanut butter.” [audience laughs] Yeah, there’s a lot of dads out there just white-knuckling it through life right now, clinging to a jar of chunky Jif like it’s the answer, just a buoy in the storm. “It’ll pass!” [audience laughs] The only mental health advice my dad ever gave me is I was having panic attacks in high school and I didn’t know what they were and I was very stressed out. And I was, like, “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do when I feel like this. I don’t know what to do.” And he goes, “Alright. All I can tell you is that when you feel like this, get as far away from the people you care about as possible… [audience laughs] …until you feel different.” Which is advice you give a werewolf, like… [audience laughs] “Just run into the woods ’til you’re not a monster anymore. Don’t let them see you change. They won’t accept you for what you truly are.” [audience laughs] And I had friends who scared me too when I was trying to get on medication. They were, like, “Ugh, I tried. I tried anti-depressants. I didn’t like how I felt on them. I didn’t feel like myself.” And now that I’m on them, I’m, like, “Yeah, me neither! It’s the best.” [audience laughs] Okay? And I do feel like myself. I just feel like now someone’s sitting on me going, “Shh! [audience laughs] Stop talking. You will ruin everything. We are… We are trying to help you. You’d be married right now if you just shut the hell up. [audience laughs] Remember that? Yeah, us too. We are trying to help you. Go to sleep. Choose a different adventure.” [audience laughs] And they warn you about the side effects when you get on medication. They go, “You know, your sex drive might go down.” And I’ll be honest, I have experienced that since I got on medication, but I can’t tell if my sex drive is lower or if my self-esteem is just higher now. [audience laughs] You know? [audience claps, cheers] It’s, like, am I not in the mood, or do I just not need the validation? Which is it? Because depression will bring you to your knees and you’re, like, “While I’m down here, might as well make someone feel good. I… do not want to waste a trip.” [audience whoops] If you’re not laughing, congrats on your serotonin. [audience laughs] And if you’re, like, “What’s serotonin?” Don’t worry. You have enough. [audience laughs] I wasn’t sure if I was gonna talk about it on stage, and then I needed new material and I was, like, “Fire sale! Everything goes.” [audience laughs] No, truthfully, I was surprised that I felt so bad about it ’cause I think I’m pretty open-minded. And I don’t think anybody should feel bad if they get diagnosed with a mental illness ’cause it’s just information about you that helps you know how to take better care of yourself. [audience cheers] Yeah. Being bipolar, there’s nothing wrong with it. Being bipolar is like not knowing how to swim. It might be embarrassing to tell people and it might be hard to take you certain places. [audience laughs] [audience continues laughing] But they have arm floaties. [audience laughs] And if you just take your arm floaties, you can go wherever the hell you want. [audience laughs] And… I know some of you are, like, “But Taylor, what if people judge me for taking arm floaties?” Well, those people don’t care if you live or die, so maybe who cares? [audience whoops] Maybe fuck those people a little. [audience cheers] I don’t know. That being said, you have to take your arm floaties [audience laughs] because it’s not cool to know you can’t swim, go to the public pool anyway, and jump into the deep end, making it everyone else’s problem. [audience laughs] And you thrash around going, “I’m good!” They’re like, “You’re literally drowning.” And then someone nice and handsome jumps in to help you. And you’re, like, “See? I’m fine. I can totally swim.” And they’re, like, “No, you’re holding him underwater. [audience laughs] You turned Kevin into an arm floaty [audience laughs] and that’s not a fair relationship for Kevin.” [audience laughs] Then someone floats by you on their back and you’re, like, “What was that?” And they’re, like, “Oh, that’s someone whose parents supported them in the pool… [audience laughs] …until they could be trusted not to die. [audience laughs] Here are your arm floaties.” [audience laughs] I was very nervous to tell friends of mine I was bipolar because I thought they would think of me differently. And then I told all my friends and nobody did and it was actually pretty insulting. [audience laughs] Because I’ve had friends tell me they were bipolar and I was, like, “What? You? You’re kidding.” And then I told my friends and they were, like, “That checks out. That’s… [audience laughs] That connects a lot of dots for us.” I told Dustin, one of my best friends in the whole world, and he goes, “Yeah, your mental illness was kinda like your middle name. I didn',\n",
       "  \"’t know what it was but I knew that you had one.” [audience laughs] It’s really good. That was not the feedback I kept getting from romantic partners, by the way. [audience laughs] That’s not what finally made me get help. Every guy I’ve ever dated has told me I have trust issues, which is something liars say when you’re on to them. [audience laughs] [in deep voice] “You have trust issues, babe.” You have a hot co-worker and a locked phone, so… [audience laughs] I have trust issues but I earned them, okay? [audience laughs] I absolutely earned them, like, I got cheated on in college. My college boyfriend was sleeping with sex workers behind my back, or prostitutes if you’re old and don’t know that word’s not okay to use anymore. Sometimes older crowd members could get confused ’cause they’re, like, “What is a sex worker?” “Is that what my granddaughter does on Instagram?” [audience laughs] And you’re, like, “No, no, no, she’s just hot. That’s a FabFitFun box.” “That’s a different…” [audience laughs] “That’s a different thing.” [audience laughs] “Your granddaughter doesn’t… That’s not a job.” “That’s not real.” [audience laughs] You can’t say prostitute anymore. Calling a sex worker a prostitute is like calling a comedian a clown. You’re not technically wrong but you are a fucking asshole, so… [audience laughs] But I told my therapist I got cheated on like this and she didn’t say what I wanted her to say, which was, “Poor baby, sweetie, this session is free.” [audience laughs] Instead, she goes, “Well, you might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.” And I was like, “Oh!” And she’s like, “No, it’s a bad thing.” And I was like, [audience laughs] “Well, then could you say I have self-fulfilling prophecy? [audience laughs] Is Selena Gomez a self-fulfilling prophecy?” [audience laughs] And I said, “What does that mean, I’m a self-fulfilling prophecy?” And she goes, “Well, sometimes we expect someone to treat us poorly, so we treat them like they’re going to treat us poorly until they do.” “You thought someone was gonna cheat on you, so you treated them like they were gonna cheat on you until they did cheat on you, and then you were like, ‘See?'” [audience chuckles] And I was like, “Oh.” [audience laughs] “So I’m a witch.” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] And she’s like, “Oh! So close. You’re a bitch.” “You gotta…” [audience laughs] I’m like, “Whatever. All I heard was Gryffindor!” [audience laughs] I am working on my trust issues. I was so much worse when I first started seeing my therapist. I told her like first session, I was like, “The guy I’m dating keeps answering my phone calls, ‘Hey, beautiful?'” [audience laughs] And she’s like, “So, what’s the problem?” I was like, “I mean, I don’t know yet.” [audience laughs] “But when I find out who ‘Beautiful’ is…” [audience laughs] She’s like, “Do you think it might be you?” I was like, “I’m sorry. I thought we were here to work.” [audience laughs] I think I’m cute or whatever now, but I was an ugly kid with honest parents, and that shit stays in your bones, alright? If you were an ugly kid with honest parents, I don’t care how attractive you grow up to be, at any point, if someone’s like, “You look really nice today,” you’re like, “Yeah, whatever. I know the Goddamn truth.” [audience laughs] When I was ten, I said, “Dad, am I pretty?” And his response was, “Look.” [audience laughs] “I’m not the best looking guy, right?” “No, but I wake up every morning and I try.” [audience laughs] “I…” “I take a shower, I put on a nice suit, and I do okay!” [audience whoops] And then he went to work. [audience laughs] And I became a comedian, I guess. [audience laughs] That was his response to his ten-year-old daughter. Just like, “You and me, potato face, these were the cards we were dealt.” “Get clean and match.” “That’s all you can do. Don’t sleep on wet hair. Can’t do that.” “Maybe wear a hat sometimes. Cover up some of that head.” “I’m sorry there’s so much of it.” [audience laughs] I think I’m pretty. I have a big head. I know I do ’cause every guy I’ve ever dated has made a point to be like, “I love your big head.” [audience laughs] That’s my favorite thing guys do when they compliment the thing you hate most about yourself, they’re like, “I love your soft arms.” You’re like, “Okay. [audience laughs] Yeah? I love your weird balls. How does it feel? [audience laughs] [audience cheers] How does it feel to be accepted?” [audience chuckles] I’m a nightmare to date. [audience laughs] Anything nice you do or say, I’m just like, “Whatever.” I dated a guy once who told me that flirting with me was like punching water. [audience laughs] And I was like, “Why? ‘Cause it’s pointless or ’cause you look stupid doing it?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Did you hear it?” I’m like, “I heard it that time. Yeah.” [audience laughs] And then he cheated on me, so, you know, prophecy fulfilled! [audience laughs] I can’t help it. At the beginning of a relationship with a guy, I just assume anything nice he does is he a move he pulls on everybody and I’m not gonna fall for your choreography, sir. [audience laughs] I’m like, “Oh, is this… is this your move? You open the car door for me on the date? [woman laughs] Is this like your move? [chuckles] This is how you do it? That’s cute. Bet that works a lot.” [audience laughs] “Oh, is this… is this your move? You go with me to my grandpa’s funeral, hold an umbrella over my head in the rain? [audience laughs] Is this like… Is this like your move? This is how you do it? [audience laughs] Like, ‘Whoops, don’t get wet.’ ‘Oops! I am.’ Whatever. [audience laughs, cheers] This ain’t my first rodeo. I used to have two grandpas.” [audience laughs] [audience chuckles] “O\",\n",
       "  'h, is this… Is this your move? [audience chuckles] You die next to me in a hospital bed at 86 years old holding my hand for all eternity? Is this like your move? This is how you get pussy?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “We’ve been together for 60 years.” I’m like, “You’re a fuckboy and I know it! [audience laughs] Don’t bury me with this guy. He’s been dying with other people behind my back. [audience laughs] I can’t prove it. Check his phone when he uses the bedpan.” [audience laughs] And that’s why we’re in therapy. [audience laughs] People are scared to go to therapy because they think it’s someone sitting in a chair going, “You suck.” But it’s not. It’s you in a chair going, “I suck.” [audience laughs] And then your therapist is like, “That’s great. Let’s start there.” [audience laughs] Therapy just helps you to get to the bottom of why you’re trash, okay? You go into therapy and you’re like, “Here’s all the stuff that sucks about me.” And she goes, “Okay.” And she puts it all up on the wall like you’re solving a crime together. Fun! [audience laughs] And then she gets some of that red string that detectives use at home when they’ve been thrown off the case for going rogue [audience laughs] and she starts connecting each crappy thing about you to each one of your corresponding childhood traumas, and you’re like, “Oh my God! That’s why I’m like this.” And she’s like, “That’s why you’re like this.” And you’re like, “Am I fixed now?” And she’s like, “God, no! [audience laughs] No, no, no.” You’re like, “Well, what do I do now?” She’s like, “Well, you keep coming back in here every week with your credit card.” And you’re like, “What? Will I ever be fixed?” She’s like, “I don’t know. Bring your credit card!” [audience laughs] I’ve got to the bottom of a lot of stuff in therapy. I’m an emotional eater. I don’t know if anybody else identifies with that. [audience whoops] Cool. Seven people. Everyone else is like, “No, we just eat until we’re almost full and then we thank God for the opportunity, okay.” [audience laughs] “Food is just fuel for me.” If you’re one of those, fuck right off, for real. [audience laughs] I’ll refund your money. I don’t need your support. [audience cheers] I’m doing fine. If you don’t know what an emotional eater is, it just means you like eat to cope with uncomfortable feelings. So if I’m like sad or anxious or awake, I like to be eating to take the edge off. [audience laughs] If you still don’t know if that’s you, you can ask yourself a few questions to find out. Number one. When you eat nachos in public, do you get kinda mad that other people are there to see it? [audience laughs] Do you feel like nachos should come with a privacy curtain? I do. [audience laughs] Have all the best meals of your life taken place in your own car around 11 p.m.? [audience laughs] Under a flickering streetlamp? Have you ever eaten a brownie while you felt okay [audience laughs] and wished you were sad… [audience laughs] …so that it tasted better? [audience laughs] Sounds like more than seven of us. [audience laughs] In therapy, I figured out the day in my childhood I became an emotional eater. I was eight years old and I was eating a bagel in the kitchen and my dad came in and he goes, “You’re gonna want to put that bagel down. I gotta tell you something.” And that’s when he told me that my mom had died. So somewhere in my brain, something clicked, like, “Oh, when you stop eating bread, [audience laughs] people perish.” [audience laughs] I went back to fourth grade like the angel of death. Everyone’s like, “Step on a crack, break your mother’s back.” I’m like, “Stop eating bread, now your mom’s dead, dude. [audience laughs] They left out that second part but…” I had a lisp when I was eight. I tell you guys that because no one told me. [audience laughs] They pulled me aside a year later at school. Someone’s like, “Taylor, your teacher thinks you might be struggling with a speech impediment.” I’m like, [with lisp] “What’s a speech impediment? [audience laughs] [with lisp] Are you sure you have the right person, ’cause… I’m crushing it out there.” [audience laughs] And they’re like, “You didn’t do anything wrong. You just pronounce your words a little differently, like you say “sh” instead of “ss” for your S’s, does that make sense? And I was like, [with lisp] “I’m pretty sure I would have noticed [audience laughs] if I said ‘sh’ instead of ‘sh’. Hope you find who you’re looking for. [audience laughs] If you have any follow-up questions, I’ll be on the see-saw.” [audience laughs] I know dead mom jokes make people uncomfortable. I know that and if you are uncomfortable, I don’t know what to say, you should’ve worked harder so it was you up here. [audience laughs, cheers] No, honestly, I never want to make people feel uncomfortable with that information. So much so that I used to lie to everybody. Growing up, I used to tell everybody that my parents were separated so I wouldn’t have to say my mom’s dead. And that worked very well until recently a friend of mine found out I had lied and she was very upset. [audience laughs] She was like, “Your mom’s dead? Taylor, you told me your parents were separated.” And I was like, “Well, they were! [audience laughs] By Jesus.” [audience laughs] Both her parents are alive, so she has no idea how funny that is but… [audience laughs] She’ll get it eventually, right? Like that joke is a slow burn. [audience laughs] Kinda like cancer, which is what got mine, hey oh! [audience laughs] Okay, alright. [audience laughs] [groans] Here’s the deal, Boston. [audience laughs] We have another, like, six minutes of dead mom jokes. [audience laughs] I know. You’re getting like, “Whoa, no, six mi',\n",
       "  'nutes is a long time.” It won’t feel long. I have cushioned her, alright? [audience laughs] I have laid my dead mom to rest in a beautiful casket of dick jokes and pop culture references. There’s something for everybody over the next six minutes. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll forget she’s dead. [audience laughs] But I know a lot’s happening for you as a crowd right now because you’re like, “Taylor, we’re good people. Good people wouldn’t laugh at dead mom jokes.” I’m here to tell you that if you’re trying to be a good person at a comedy show, you’re wasting your God damn time. [audience laughs] Trying to be a good person at a comedy show is like trying to recycle at a theme park. You’re already in here and part of the problem, put your hands up and have fun. [audience laughs] And I know you’re good people. You’re like, “Taylor, we’ve known you for 25 minutes. We hate that anything bad ever happened to you even once.” Thank you so much, Boston. But what you have to understand is the bad thing already happened and now I’m talking about it into a microphone in front of people who paid to be here, [audience laughs] which means now the bad thing is money. [audience laughs] Do you think I’d be this successful at my age if I had a live mom? [audience laughs] [audience whoops] [shouts] Fuck no! [audience laughs] I’d be a creative writing teacher who loved myself and I’d be sitting in the dark with you pheasants, okay? [audience laughs] She’s in heaven, I’m on Netflix, it all worked out. [audience cheers] That is a real thing I said in therapy. [audience laughs] To which my therapist responded, “You should come in twice this week.” [audience laughs] Some people get sad because I was eight when it happened. But eight is a great time to lose a parent because you’re so stupid, you barely know what’s going on. When I was eight, I was like, the only people I know with dead moms are Disney princesses. [audience chuckles] So like, this sucks but am I about to get hot? [audience laughs] Then I hit puberty and I was like, “Oh no, I guess God just hates me right now, that’s a bummer.” That’s a joke. God doesn’t hate anybody, alright? Not anymore. [audience laughs] But have you read the Old Testament? Holy shit. [audience laughs] The Old Testament is my favorite Taylor Swift album. It is… [audience laughs] It is banger after banger. Just like, “You don’t believe in me? [in singsong voice] Snakes! Look what you made me do.” [audience laughs] I’m a 20-something white woman, obviously, I’m gonna compare T. Swift to the Lord, alright? [audience laughs] She is the only god I still believe in, alright? [audience cheers] I don’t see God God revamping his old shit and let’s be honest, he probably should ’cause the people who own it now suck. [audience laughs, cheers] It does grow you up very quickly, losing a parent that young. I mean, I saw a dead body when I was eight which means I saw a dead body years before I saw a dick. And that is not the order that shit should go in [audience laughs] according to the American Girl Body book. [audience laughs] Although maybe it should be ’cause you know what’s crazy? A dick? Way more traumatizing than your dead mom. [audience laughs] Oh my God, it’s so much worse. I saw my mom, I was like, “That lady used to make me snacks, now she’s very still.” I saw a dick for the first time, I was like, “Oh my God! Who took Jabba the Hutt’s eyes? [audience laughs] You have done nothing for me. No, no, no. No, I didn’t say Beetlejuice even one time!” [audience laughs] I haven’t seen that many dicks and I don’t want to see any more and it’s nothing against men, I’m attracted to you for some reason but I swear to God, every time you see a new dick, there is an adjustment period, isn’t there? [audience laughs] Just a real quick like… [huffs deeply] and we’re back in it, alright. [audience laughs] I have stayed in relationships too long ’cause I just wasn’t ready to see a fresh one. I just couldn’t [audience laughs] couldn’t wrap my head around it, literally or figuratively. I just… I just didn’t have it in me, couldn’t have it in me. And… [audience laughs] I don’t care how many dicks you’ve seen, every time you see a new dick, it feels like jumping into a cold pool. Just like, [nervously] “Alright, let me just swim around, get used to this one.” “Okay, alright, this one’s deeper than the last one but that’s okay.” “That’s alright. This is why we take our arm floaties, you know, for moments like these.” [audience claps, cheers] [grunting] Just control your breathing, hot girl summer, bitch, you can do it. [audience laughs] I think of the genitalia options available, I think dick seem friendlier, you know. They’re up, they’re happy to see you, they’re wagging, I’ve never had sex. [audience laughs] It’s like a front tail, right? [audience laughs] I’ll Google it, it’s fine. It’s all speculation. I’ve never seen a vagina, not even my own, I’m a Christian. [audience laughs] But from what I hear, it is very spooky down there. It’s just a dark spooky hole, like, a hole? I’m sorry, what? Every time someone fingers me, I’m like, “You are very trusting, sir, because…” [audience laughs] “…I don’t even know where that goes.” “That might be where I keep the bipolar. That might be…” [audience laughs] “…where it has been… actually, if you see any, could you scrape it out?” “Could you…” [audience laughs] “…just like a mental health Pap smear?” “Can you just do…” [audience laughs] Don’t do that. Like, you gotta hook your finger, like when a baby’s choking, are you familiar? If you do that, it’ll push it in too far, it’s too late. But if you hook your finger, you swipe it, that’s how you get it out. [audience laughs] I like doing that j',\n",
       "  'oke because it goes too far but you do learn something that could save a life. [audience laughs] I just love the idea of years from now, someone being like, “If it weren’t for that dick joke, my niece would not be here.” [audience laughs] The craziest thing that happened is my mom died of cancer. See? You almost forgot. [audience laughs] And then my dad got remarried and then our stepmom got cancer. She’s fine, don’t worry. I wouldn’t do that to you twice. [audience laughs] That’s God talking to my dad. And… As soon as our stepmom got it, me and my siblings were like, “Holy shit.” “Is Dad giving people cancer?” [audience laughs] We thought he was a carcinogen. We were like, “Don’t microwave anything for him.” [audience laughs] “I think that’s how he’s doing it.” If he had taken down a second one, we would’ve put a warning on his Christian Mingle account. Like bare minimum, just like, “Hey, chemicals in here have been known to cause cancer.” “Ride at your own risk.” [audience laughs] I feel like some people don’t believe me that she’s alive. She’s completely fine, you guys. She’s happy, healthy, great lady. We actually call my stepmom Mom because when my dad married her, nobody was using it. So we were like, “Yeah, be Mom, who cares.” [audience laughs] Oh, I’m sorry, if your principal quit and you got a new principal, they wouldn’t be like, “This is Lisa.” Like… [audience laughs] Let her be principal, there is an opening. [audience laughs] Also, we were so young when it happened and my dad got remarried so fast, I think he was kinda hoping he could just like Indiana Jones switch them out [audience laughs] before anybody noticed. You know when you’re a kid and your hamster dies and your parents don’t want to explain death to you so they just buy you a new one that looks the same and they’re like, “No, that’s Connie, she just bites now.” [audience laughs] That’s kinda what he did. But with moms. But I never used to talk about any of that, I never used to talk about my mom dying because I didn’t want to make people uncomfortable and also, like most of us with childhood trauma, should be pretty much everyone in here. If you’re sitting here tonight going, “I don’t think I have any, I have great parents, I had a good childhood and this ‘comedy show’? It’s not that fun for me.” [audience laughs] Good. [audience laughs] I hope this is the worst night of your whole life. [audience laughs] ‘Cause it sounds like it’s been smooth sailing [audience laughs] and you might need some perspective. Most of us did have some childhood trauma and when you get to be an adult, you’re like, “Woo, made it! Never have to think about that again. Look at all my keys. The world’s my oyster.” [audience laughs] And so you just start pushing all that dark stuff that happened to you as a kid down, down, down ’til you don’t even think about it anymore. And that works for a long time. [audience chuckles] Until one day, [audience laughs] you stub your toe really hard on a curb and you just start weeping uncontrollably in the street and you’re like, “Okay, this is about something else. [audience laughs] I was keeping all my trauma in that toe. [audience laughs] And then I jostled it and now it’s everywhere. [audience laughs] [whispering] Gone over here.” [audience laughs] And if you don’t deal with that stuff, it’s gonna keep affecting you in ways you are not even conscious of. I realized in therapy that because my mom died young, I have this irrational belief that I am also going to die young, so I’ve been living in a very intense unhealthy way my entire adult life where I’m like, I can’t take a break, I gotta be working all the time, I have to hit these goals and achievements, otherwise I’m nothing. I got engaged a few years ago ’cause I was like, “I gotta get married before I’m dead” which is a super hot way to propose to somebody. [audience laughs] I call it “The Walk to Remember,” it’s kinda my move and… [audience claps] It did not work out with my ex-fiancé. I hate that I have to say that word now. It sounds like a spell, doesn’t it? [shouting] Just like, “Ex-fiancé!” It’s terrible. [audience laughs] He and I are not friends, not ’cause he’s a bad person, he’s actually a very good person. I don’t know if you’ve dated someone right before they find out they’re bipolar but it is what is known as “The Lord’s work.” [audience laughs] I think I was a great partner if nothing went wrong. If nothing went wrong, I was like, awesome. But if one thing went wrong, total nightmare. Like, I was like those spikes you drive over when you’re returning a rental car. Like as long as you keep moving forward, everything’s great. But if you back up even a little, I will slash all your tires. [audience laughs] And then be like, “What? I put up a sign.” [audience laughs] And you’re like, “I know, I mean, I know I messed up a little but like this reaction seems cra… like other speed bumps don’t react like that.” And I’m like, “Then go be with her!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] We are not friends, my ex-fiancé and I, because I think it’s weird when exes try to be friends with each other and they’re like, “We’ll hang out, we’ll get fro yo.” You’re like, “Fro yo? I know what you taste like. I’m not gonna sample yogurt with you, [audience laughs] you psycho. Do they have Kevin after a run, do they have that flavor at Yogurtland?” They do, it’s salted caramel, but still. [audience cheers, claps] I went back home after I called off my engagement for whatever holiday doesn’t offend you and… [audience laughs] …a lot of my friends are settling down. Some of them are just settling, period, end of sentence. [audience laughs] You guys know those couples? Everyone knows one couple like',\n",
       "  ' that where like one person in the couple is way hotter and cooler than the other person in the couple. I like to call those couples chocolate-covered raisins. [audience laughs] Because you’re like sure, you could put those two together, if you want. [audience laughs] But every time you see them, you’re like, “Chocolate, what are you doing? [audience laughs] You could’ve been with anybody. You could’ve been with caramel, you could’ve been with marshmallow, you could’ve been with peanut butter, who I heard cures depression, [audience laughs] and you want to be with raisin forever? Like, no offense, raisin, you’re great, we love you, nature’s candy, that’s you. But you belong with like oatmeal, like, you know that, right? This doesn’t feel good, right? Aren’t you scared every day that someone’s gonna come along and suck chocolate right off of you? [audience laughs] I love this joke ’cause I like to see couples in the audience looking at each other like, “Am I chocolate or raisin? [audience laughs] We’re both chocolate, right, babe? We’re chocolate-covered chocolate? We’re like those little Lindor guys in the foil, you know? I’m the creamy part and you’re the shell [sobbing] ’cause you’re so strong and if you leave me, I’ll be a mess.” [audience laughs] Some of you are like, “I am oatmeal and I am good with it.” [audience laughs] I made the mistake of talking to my happiest married friend after I called off my engagement, don’t do that. Your happiest married friend doesn’t remember what it’s like to be heartbroken. She’s like, “Well, what are you gonna do now? You’re gonna get back out there? Are you seeing anybody?” And I was like, “Nope, just gonna focus on my career for a little bit.” And she’s like, “Well, why can’t you focus on a career and a relationship at the same time?” And I was like, “How do I explain this [audience chuckles] in a way you might understand? [muttering] Why can’t I focus on a career and a relationship? Have you ever been on the freeway in traffic and your lane stops but the one next to you keeps moving, so you get in the one that’s moving, and as soon as you get in the one that’s moving, that one stops and the one next to you starts moving again. So you get back in that first one ’cause that one’s moving now and as soon as you get back in that first one, that one stops again and the one next to you starts moving. And after you go back and forth a few more times, at a certain point, you’re like, “Okay. Is it fucking me?” [audience laughs] And she’s like, “Yeah, I don’t know if I get it because you know, John and I, we usually just boop, get in the carpool lane. [audience laughs] And I was like, “Where’s your baby? Imma drop it!” [audience laughs] I actually did get into a new relationship pretty quickly after I called off my engagement. I wasn’t trying to, I really wasn’t. A lot of my friends were like, “You should stay single for a while. You should maybe get a cat.” And I was like, hard pass. I have never left an interaction with a cat feeling better about who I was. [audience laughs] Every cat reacts to people the way I react to seeing girls I went to middle school with in a Target. Just like… [audience laughs] [shouts] Oh, no! Like that’s every cat. [audience laughs] I don’t want to come home to that energy. [audience laughs] But I wasn’t looking for a relationship. I was trying to have like a fun, sexy fling which doesn’t usually go great for me because I have this round wholesome face that people think they should build a life with. [audience laughs] Every time I’m like, “We could bone or whatever.” Guys are like, “No, I’m alright but you could meet my mom, do you want to do that? You seem like you’d be better at meeting my mom than having sex.” And they are not wrong, alright? [audience laughs] I will meet your mom all night long. Moms like me so much for no reason. I was dating a guy years ago, we were totally on the rocks having problems, and I went to lunch with his mom hoping to get some advice, and halfway through lunch, she puts her hand on my hand and goes, “You know, Taylor, my son’s a lot like his father. [audience chuckles] And if I could go back in time, [audience laughs] I don’t know that I’d marry his father again.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Are you saving my life in this Panera Bread right now?” [audience laughs] It was like a movie when an older character sacrifices themselves for the good of the journey, like she Gandalfed me. She was like, “Fly, you fool!” [audience laughs] She was a bad mom and a bad wife but such a good friend, oh my God! Hoes before sons, am I right? [audience laughs] I think about her every day. And my boyfriend wasn’t looking for a relationship either when we met, straight dudes usually aren’t, you know. Women are surprised when they find a guy who can make them cum and straight dudes are surprised when they find a girl who can make them feel genuine feelings in their heart. Like women are like, “He got me off three times.” And guys are like, [in low voice] “I mean, I just fucking like her, dude. [audience laughs] [in low voice] Like we talked all day, I didn’t want to hit her, it was nuts! [audience laughs] She’s just like my friend. I don’t know, I want to like lick her heart, I think.” [audience laughs] Straight dudes are so proud of themselves for falling in love. It’s really cute. They’re like, [in low voice] “I love you. Hell yeah, buddy, I knew you could get there.” [audience laughs] Women fall in love, we’re like, “I love you. [whispering] Fucking again? You dumb bitch. [audience laughs] You were supposed to love you first, you keep skipping that part! [audience laughs] It is eat, pray, then love! [audience laughs] Oh my God. It’s ok',\n",
       "  'ay, we’ll try again in a year and a half.” [audience laughs] My boyfriend is seven years older than me ’cause I needed to get back on my dad for some stuff. [audience laughs] Older guys are just better. They’re just better, you never have to ask them to buy Pepto Bismol, they just have it in the house. [audience laughs] They pull it out after dinner like a nightcap, like, “You want some pink juice, baby girl?” You’re like, “Yes, I would, cheers.” [audience laughs] Older guys don’t call you things like “cute” or “hot.” They call you things like “stunning, gorgeous,” shit with syllables, things that would take a 20-something guy a little while to settle down. [audience laughs] And older guys aren’t like, cute or hot either. You know, they’re handsome, distinguished, like old pictures of your grandpa you shouldn’t look at too long. [audience laughs] You ever find one of those in an old dusty box? You’re like, “Who is that? Oh, that’s wrong. Okay.” [audience laughs] They’re not your family in those pictures yet. They’re just the past, it is a gray area. [audience laughs] Oh, I’ll get weirder. You ever see a picture of your parents when they were young and hot? And you get like weirdly mad ’cause you know they would’ve never dated you? [audience laughs] I saw a picture of my dad in college football once. I didn’t talk to him for three weeks. I’m like, “You would’ve left me at a drive-in, you Danny Zuko piece of shit!” [audience laughs] He’s like, “What?” I’m like, “I can’t hug you for a year and I don’t want to talk about it.” [audience laughs] It’s always awkward getting into a new relationship, though, especially right after you called off an engagement because you don’t feel like you can say any cheesy romantic crap ever again. Even if you feel it, you just feel like you’re a jinx. So when the next person is like, “I wanna be with you forever.” You’re like, “Oh, wouldn’t that be something? [audience laughs] I can’t… I can’t use the F-word anymore but I just need to build my credit back up but… [audience laughs] …samesies, bro, for sure.” New relationships are awkward ’cause you gotta tell a whole new person what you like in bed and the only reason you know what you like in bed is ’cause someone else did it to you first. [audience laughs] But you can’t say it like that, right? You gotta do that cute little tap dance of like, “Oh, babe, you know what would be so fun that’s never even occurred to me before?” “You know what your body is inspiring me to do right now?” But in your head, you’re just like, “Do it like Craig. Could you just…” [audience laughs] “Do it how Craig did it every time?” “Craig didn’t do shit right, he did that right, let me tell you.” “Can we just call him?” “Can we just call him and ask?” [audience laughs] “It’s not a big deal, we’re all adults here.” “Remember we reset the Wi-Fi router last month?” “It’s just like that, babe. He’s just a voice on the phone with the password.” [audience laughs] “That’s all he is to me now.” “No, I did block his number when you asked me to, of course I did.” “But when you block a number, your phone kinda just saves it in a different folder.” [audience laughs] Oh, some of us are gonna fight in the car, not everybody knew that. [audience laughs] You have to be able to talk about what you like in bed and you have to know what you can and can’t say, alright? Like I’ve been telling guys for years I like it a little rougher in bed. I don’t say it like that, I say like, “Oh, I’m damaged,” you know. [audience laughs] If you’re a straight guy, don’t say that. If a straight dude’s like, [in low voice] “I’m damaged,” fucking run! That guy… that guy wants your toes in a baggy. So… [audience laughs] Sometimes you think you like something and you don’t. I thought I like dirty talk, turns out, I just like dirty phrases we agreed upon earlier. [audience laughs] You ever tell someone you like dirty talk and then they hit you with something in bed and you’re like, “Nah, that was not approved by corporate, no.” [audience laughs] I was having sex with a guy once, I was on top and he just went, [shouting] “Look at you!” [audience laughs] [audience laughs, cheers] Like I was taking my first steps. [audience laughs] I’m like, “You better get the camcorder, daddy, ’cause I am never getting up here again.” [audience laughs] My parents don’t watch me do stand-up anymore, don’t worry. [audience laughs] Don’t worry, they’re not interested. No Christian parents want to watch their daughter talk about depression and dick for an hour. It’s not fun for them. [audience laughs] My parents don’t have a dark sense of humor and I do, and I’m glad I do because if you can laugh at the darkest stuff that’s ever happened to you while it’s still actively happening to you, sometimes that’s what gets you through it. For example, here’s a joke they will not like. [audience laughs] Did you guys know that sometimes when you call a suicide hotline and the call drops, they do not call you back? [audience laughs] Yeah, you think that’d be the time for star 69 but sometimes they just ring a bell in the cubicle, like, “Lost another one, that’s lunch!” [audience laughs] Some of you are tensing up like, “Did that really happen?” Yeah, a few years ago and it was fucking hilarious. I was on the floor of a DoubleTree Hotel, like, “Did this bitch just ghost me while I’m trying to ghost myself?” “That is…” [audience laughs] “I mean, I’ve been left on read, I’ve never been left for dead.” “That’s a new one.” [audience laughs] “That is brutal.” I wasn’t even mad. For all I know, that’s how they train those volunteers. Like, “Hey, some nights, we get too many calls. [audience laughs] Fridays are big for us, in those situations, ',\n",
       "  'you’re just gonna have to use your best judgment, alright? Like I usually wait for like a privileged white girl name, like a Chelsea, a Kelsey, a Taylor. Those are the salmon I throw back and hope they swim upstream on their own.” [audience laughs] Even if I was mad, what am I gonna do, hop on Yelp? Like, “One star, totally killed myself. [audience laughs] You’re gonna wish I killed myself after this review.” [audience laughs] I did that joke in Texas a few weeks ago and there was a girl, white, my age in the crowd who goes, [shouting] “And the wait times are ridiculous!” [audience laughs] And she’s right, okay? I think, personally, I think if you are a frequent caller, there should be some sort of rewards program. You know, like when you show loyalty to an airline. Like, you should be able to do that with suicide hotlines where you call in and they’re like, [in robotic voice] “Please enter your rewards number.” Boop, boop, boop. “Welcome back… [sobbing] Taylor. [audience laughs] Thank you for your diamond medallion status. You are now third in line. Would you like to use an upgrade and kick someone else out? [audience laughs] My parents are still very, very religious. My dad was so religious growing up, he used to insist on praying out loud in restaurants before we ate dinner, which is fine if you’re into that but keep it short. [audience laughs] He wouldn’t do that. He would do long, drawn-out prayers full of personal details that none of us signed off on at the table which made puberty pretty rough with your dad in public just like, “Thank you Lord for this food. Thank you for bringing us here together. [shouting] Thank you that Taylor’s a woman now and is getting the help she needs in math.” I’m like, “Can you not tell this Chipotle that I’m bleeding and can’t subtract? [audience laughs] I think God knows.” It’s why I don’t feel bad telling jokes about my parents on stage now ’cause anytime they’re like, “Do you have to air our dirty laundry in front of strangers?” I’m like, “Hometown Buffet, 1998. [audience laughs] You told everyone within a five-booth radius that I shat my pants the night before. [audience laughs] I can say whatever I want. [audience laughs] I’m not religious anymore. I have had some friends find religion as adults recently which is very upsetting. [inhales deeply] [audience laughs] If you grew up religious and you’re not anymore and your adult friends find religion, it feels like God is your shitty ex-boyfriend who’s now getting it together for your friend and you just have to watch it happen on Facebook. They’re like, “Have you met God? He’s amazing.” I’m like, “Yeah, I grew up with God, he’s a douchebag, alright? Did he tell you you were broken and you need him? That’s his move. That’s what he does. [audience laughs] He says that to everybody. Don’t drink what he gives you. You drink that, the next thing you know, you’re eating his body, the holy spirit’s inside you, it’s a whole system they have over at that frat house they call church. [audience laughs] Who else uses Roman numerals?” [audience laughs] That joke makes it sound like I resent my religious upbringing and I do, so I nailed it. But… [audience cheers, claps] No, honestly, if I had to come up with some stuff that was like positive about my growing up religious, I’m sure I could with enough time and money but… [audience laughs] I do have some issues with it. It gave me some serious trust issues and it just made me weird, growing up in church, in ways that I am still discovering. For example, I just found out that I masturbate wrong. [audience laughs] I will back up. Okay, so… [audience laughs] When I was growing up in church, kids had youth group and at youth group, they were like, “Don’t have sex.” And we were like, “For sure, for sure.” And then, they were like, “Don’t even masturbate.” And all the girls were like, “Okay, we didn’t even know that we could.” [audience laughs] And all the boys were like, “Why?” And… [audience laughs] …the way they explained it to us was, our youth pastor told us, he goes, “It’s not the physical act of masturbating that’s the sin, you guys, alright? It’s not even the orgasm. In fact, if you have a wet dream, thank God for the freebie and have an awesome day. [audience laughs] But what are you thinking about while you’re doing that to yourself, guys? [scattered laughs] That’s what the sin is. It’s the lust in your heart. It’s the impure thoughts in your head. That is what the sin is.” So when I got to be an adult and I wanted to masturbate, I was like, “Well, if I just don’t think about anything, [audience laughs] I could probably still go to heaven, right? Just like, clear your mind, get in there, get it done, see you soon, Jesus, right? [audience laughs] Touch nothing but the lamb.” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] So I’ve been doing this my entire adult life. All my friends are like, “You gotta meditate.” I’m like, “I think I do.” [audience laughs] And I do mean my entire adult life, by the way. I did not masturbate until I was a grown woman. I was that afraid of going to hell, alright? Yeah. I had my first orgasm with my college boyfriend. Do you know how embarrassing that is to get your first orgasm from another person? That’s like having a realtor show you your own house. [audience laughs] They’re like, “And over here, we have a second bathroom.” You’re like, “A second bathroom?” [audience laughs] “You’ve been here for 19 years, you never went poking around on your own?” You’re like, “I did once but I thought Jesus would get mad, [audience laughs] so yeah, I don’t actually own this place, I’m just renting it from the guy upstairs, and… if I flood the basement, I do not get my security',\n",
       "  \" deposit back, so… [audience laughs] Is there anything else I should see while you’re here?” She’s like, “Yeah, let me show you the doorbell.” I’m like, “Oh, is the doorbell even important?” She’s like, “The doorbell is the only thing that matters. [audience laughs, claps] Nobody comes inside without touching the doorbell.” [audience laughs] “Oh, but I did touch it.” “You didn’t use enough pressure, it didn’t light up.” [audience laughs] So I’ve been masturbating like this my entire adult life and I recently mentioned it to a friend of mine and you ever say something out loud and realize you never should have ever? [audience laughs] I said it so casually over brunch, didn’t even think about it. I was like, “Oh yeah, I mean, I don’t think about anything while I do that.” And she was like, “What?” She put her fork down. “What? [audience laughs] You don’t think about anything?” And I was like, “Oh, no, I mean, I think some stuff, obviously. And she was like, “What do you think about?” And I was like, “Oh, you know, just like, ‘almost there, making good time.’ [audience laughs] You know, just like road trip thoughts, like… ‘keep your hands steady, don’t fall asleep. Can’t wait to get there so I can eat. [audience laughs] Better hurry up, Taco Bell’s gonna close, ‘ you know.” [audience laughs] And she was like, “That is so weird, Taylor, why don’t you just watch porn like a normal person?” And I was like, “Ugh, I don’t like porn.” Every time I try to watch porn, I’m just like, “You gotta shave there, too? [audience laughs] I’m tired and I’m cold.” And I’m not against porn, okay? I’m not one of these people that’s like, “If you watch porn, it will ruin your relationship.” I don’t feel that way, alright? I dated a guy once who was really into massage porn where the masseuse would like fuck their client at the end which means sometimes when we had sex, I get a massage! [audience laughs, cheers] That’s an example of porn working for you! [audience laughs] But my friend was like horrified. She was like, “Taylor, this like monk masturbation thing you do, [audience laughs] it is so much creepier and weirder than any porn I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen most of it.” [audience laughs] And she goes, “There are so many different options porn-wise on the internet now, you… just go home and Google ‘porn for women’ okay? Just do it, I promise, ‘porn for women.'” And so I went home and I googled porn for women so I wouldn’t be weird at brunch. [audience laughs] And a lot of surprising things came up when I googled it. First thing that came up when I googled porn for women was a link to Disney Plus where all the Avengers movies are. Now… [audience laughs] For me, personally, they jump around too much. There’s too many storylines. You’re almost there with Loki and now we’re on Captain America? It’s like, I have to start over. That’s a different speed, a different pressure and now there’s a raccoon? No. [audience laughs] The second thing that came up when I googled porn for women was a website where real-life couples are uploading amateur sex tapes. Yeah, real-life couples are like, “Hey, we’re so happy and in love, we thought that we would film ourselves making love and then put it online for you, a lonely person. [audience laughs] Is it working? Are you wet?” And you’re like, “Not in the right place, no. [audience laughs] But congratulations, what you have seems really special.” [audience laughs] The last thing that came up when I googled porn for women I did not know existed, it’s something called audio porn. It’s exactly what it sounds like. There’s no visual aspect, it’s all audio. It’s not really a porn star, it’s more like a porn voice actor talking you through a sexy situation. It’s like a podcast except don’t listen while you’re driving. [audience laughs] And because it’s “for women,” that just means there’s a story, right? Anyone can watch, they don’t check. [audience laughs] They don’t just hop on the mic like, [shouting] “Now it’s out, bitch!” Like they ease you into it. And so the one I found is 20 minutes long. I will send it to you if you DM me. [audience laughs] And the first 12 minutes, the story, is just a man calming you down [audience laughs] after you’ve been in a car wreck. [audience laughs] That is the foreplay. [audience laughs] And you guys, I came so hard. I… [audience laughs, claps] I mean, I didn’t even make it to the sex part. It was the comfort alone. He’s like, “It’s okay, take some deep breaths, don’t worry.” “The insurance companies will figure it out.” I’m like, “Oh my God, that’s right!” [shouting] “That’s why we have insurance!” By the time he was like, “What else can I do? Should I go down on you?” I was like, “Nah, man, I got Allstate, I’m in good hands.” [audience laughs] Thank you so much, Boston, you were absolutely amazing. [audience cheers] Thank you so much. I can’t tell you, I really appreciate you. Thank you. [upbeat music] [audience cheers] You guys were amazing. Thank you so much, seriously.

       " ['Ladies and gentlemen, from the Barclay Theatre in Irvine, California, please welcome to the stage, Whitney Cummings. Love you. All bitches, come on! Thank you, guys, so much for coming out tonight, man. It’s so good to be doing standup again. I took like a couple of years off. I was making a television show… You didn’t fuckin’ watch it! You did not watch it, no you didn’t. ‘Cause if you had watched it, I wouldn’t fucking be here right now. No. I would be here. This is my favorite thing to do in the world. It is so good to be back doing standup. The last couple years were kind of… interesting. I think the most intense thing that happened to me was I went through a really painful breakup, but I’m glad it happened because actually I learned a lot. I feel like, you know what, I figured out why couples breakup. I think it’s this… I think couples break up because we’re all operating under different definitions of the word love. If you think about it, we say this word to each other, and I think it just makes us raise expectations. You know, I feel like if we were all to just agree on a universal definition of the word love, we’d stop disappointing each other so much, you know? So to me, my definition of love is being willing to die for someone… that you yourself want to kill. Which is kind of confusing… like if someone were to break into my house and hold up a gun to the person I love, I would jump in front of the gun. I’d go, “Wait, no, stop! Let me do it! Dude, I am begging you!” I also think in this culture we express love in a very twisted way. In this culture we show love by giving each other presents… jewelry and trips and stuff… and to me, that’s not what love’s about. That’s too easy, you know. For me love is about the way you treat a person on a daily basis when no one else is around. Little things, you know? Like if you love me, for example, the second sex is over, if I was on top, don’t push me off you… as quickly as possible… If you love me, you will let me dismount with a little fucking dignity. You will let me dismount like the swan that I am. Thank you, sir. Or, if you were on top, by some fucking miracle… don’t use my body as a pushing off point. When you get off, don’t push off my face… to go check your phone. It’s about respect. Love to me is about respect. Little things, you know. If you love me and we’re taking a shower together, don’t pee. Why is that so confusing? Don’t-don’t make me stand in your piss… like a fucking asshole. Use your head. You know, if you love me, you’ll think ahead. Little things like if you love me and you buy me lingerie as a gift, don’t buy me a small top and a medium bottom. Okay? If you love me, you will buy me a large top and a small bottom, and I’ll exchange that shit on my own time. Love is just like don’t be stupid. You know, little things. Like if you love me, let me wake up before you start having sex with me. Can I get some gum? Can you just give me a sec… This isn’t prison. I’m going to say ‘yes’. Have a little faith in yourself, you know?\\nI also think that phrase “I love you” is tricky because I think when you’re in a relationship for a long time, it starts to lose its value, you know. It starts to deteriorate. Like when you first say I love you, it’s such a big deal. You know, you’re like “I love you”, but after awhile, you’re just like “Love you!” Then after that, you’re just like, “You, too”, and finally you’re just like “Fuck you!”\\nLove is dangerous, you know. It’s a very dangerous thing we do. We give someone else the ability to hurt us. At any moment you could just get your heart broken, have your life ruined just like that, and I think that makes us all a little tense. I think we’re all a little on edge, you know. Love is so insane that when you hear about someone who’s in love who does a terrible thing, you side with them. Like when I hear about a woman who killed her husband, the first thing I think I’m like, well, what the fuck did he do? That poor woman!\\nLove makes you think about things you never thought you’d do before, you know? Like getting married. This last relationship I ',\n",
       "  'thought I was going to get married. For me, I never thought I was going to get married because I have all this divorce in my family, you know, but I also think that when you get older as a woman, marriage just becomes a little more appealing because marriage is set up for girls as an offer that you just cannot refuse, you know? If someone came up to me on the street randomly and marriage as an institution did not exist, and someone was just like, “Excuse me ma’am. Hi, um, would you be interested in a beautiful diamond ring and a bunch of parties where your friends will buy you whatever the fuck you want?” And then you get to move into somebody else’s house and get on their health insurance plan… And then if they cheat on you, you get half their shit, no questions asked. Would you be interested in that? Yeah, man, yeah, yeah. How do I get all that shit? Well, you just have to have sex with the same man for the rest of your life. Ohhh. You know, fuck it. I have Tylenol PM. Let’s do this shit. Where do I sign up? It’s not that we love you. We just want shit, okay? It’s the same thing with sex. Like we don’t always have sex with you guys because we like want that dick. No! No! Okay? Half the time I have sex with a guy, it’s because it burns calories. I’m like oh, God. I had that lasagna today… I don’t have time to go to the gym, so… I should probably just fuck this guy. But I really go for it, you know. I wear a terrycloth headband and ankle weights. I get in there and… In this last relationship, I was going so insane that I started doing research to try to figure out what goes on chemically in your brain when you’re in love. And I read this book called The Female Brain. Has anyone read this book? Ooh! One… dude? All right, what you got going on over here considering the fact that you’re with a dude? Why would you need that book? I respect that. You just wanted to get a head start, just kind of figure it out. So you’re just here alone? I respect that. You’re not going home alone… that’s for sure. That book’s amazing, right? This book is all about the way women’s brains are wired, and essentially it said that we have like millions of more emotions and hormones and like synapses that connect… basically, it’s a miracle that we’re not crying all the fucking time… which is a bummer because I feel like guys hate that, you know? You know, I feel like guys hate that women are so emotional and sensitive, right? You guys think women are crazy, right? Yes? Okay. All right. You think this is fun for me? You think I would ever choose this for myself? You think I enjoy crying every time Adele is on the radio? That’s embarrassing, okay. You think I enjoy Googling your ex-girlfriend three hours a day? You think I have that kind of time? You think I enjoy trying to guess every one of your security question answers? Oh, shit! What street did he grow up on? It’s weird because that’s all I hear from guys is that women are crazy. Women are so crazy. But I have tons of girlfriends, and I hang out with my girlfriends alone all the time, and when guys aren’t around, women are super cool, rational, logical, but then they start dating some dude, and they lose their mind.\\nWomen are not crazy… you guys fucking make us that way. Okay? I’m just sayin’, take your passwords off your fucking phones. It’s just weird because I feel like being crazy and sensitive… like that doesn’t have to be a negative thing. I think that’s kind of an asset, you know? I think girls should be paranoid and hypervigilant and emotional because we’re responsible for raising helpless babies. Okay? We can’t think like you guys. We can’t be fucking sociopaths… or else babies would just die… all the time and our species would be extinct. Like if we felt like you guys, we would give birth to a baby, you know, take it home from the hospital if we even went to the hospital… because I don’t need a doctor. Then we would like put it in the sink for a month. Just throw Doritos on it, every now and then spray it with Axe Body Spray… And when we were done with it, we would just like put it on Craig’s List, like',\n",
       "  ', ah, I can get a few bucks for that. I feel like you guys think that we like choose to be crazy, you know? It’s an act of choice. Like I feel like you guys think that we wake up on any given morning and just decide we’re going to have a terrible day. I feel like you guys think we wake up and we’re like oh my God, I’m going to have such a good day today. I’m going to hang out with my boyfriend, we’re going to go hang out, see a movie… you know what? No. I have a better idea. I’m going to wake up, feel fat for two hours… then get mad at my boyfriend because he said good morning in a weird tone… then I’m going to break up with him in my head… I’m not going to tell him we broke up. It’s none of his fucking business whether we’re together or not. Then I’m going to go spend $200 on jeans that don’t fit… then I’m going to go eat cucumbers with barbecue sauce on them… then I’m going to get mad at him again because he suggested we see a Scarlett Johansson movie… what the fuck is that? Then I’m going to go spend two hours online looking at wedding dresses. Not a great day for us, either, you know? I think it’s funny that guys are never called crazy because I feel like guys do things that are like, crazy, you know? But guys are never called crazy. Like, for a guy to get called crazy, he’s got to be like… he’s got to be like naked in an alley jerking off on a dead pigeon… singing bible hymns like “Over the River”… But even then we’re like, oh my God, that guy is homeless. That is so sad. Do you have a dollar? Give him a dollar. But for a girl to get called crazy, we just have to send you two text messages in a row. She’s fucking crazy, man. She’s fucking stalking me, bro. She’s obsessed with me, man. I’m like I don’t know, I’m not crazy. I’m just locked out of the house. Can you let me in the house? I’m not stalking you. I live here. My house. We live together. I’m not obsessed with you. I hate you, so… Guys are never called crazy, but I feel like guys do things that are actually crazy. Like things that would put you in an insane asylum. Like you guys will talk to athletes in the TV. You think they can fucking hear you. That’s literal schizophrenia. That is a mental illness. Like I was watching some of my guy friends a couple of months ago. They were watching a Giants game and they were talking to Eli Manning. They were having a conversation with this person. They were like, Eli, listen to me. Eli, listen to me. We have been through this, bro. I’m like, bitch, you’ve not been through shit with him, man. He cannot hear you, and even if he could hear you, why would he take advice from you? You can’t even get your Heinekens in the fucking garbage can. I feel like you guys watching sports should give you a little more sympathy for us because now you know what it’s like to yell at a man and have him completely ignore you. Every day is Sunday for us. You guys say the meanest things to these athletes, the meanest things. Like they were watching Tom Brady and they were like Tom Brady, you suck. Tom Brady sucks. I don’t know that much about football, but I’m pretty sure Tom Brady doesn’t suck at football. I’m pretty sure you suck. I’m pretty sure all you suck at football. I just wish these athletes would stand up for themselves, you know, against these horrible things you say. I wish just one time Tom Brady would look directly into the camera and be like, “Hey man, fuck you, I got this… “I make 20 million dollars a year “and you can’t even do a fucking sit-up… Get off my dick, man.”\\nThat’s where you guys get delusional about sports. Like I feel if we get delusional about like relationship stuff, but sports is where you guys kind of lose your mind. Like I have this guy friend who… he carries a football around in his car… like bitch, you’re 50. No one wants to play football with you. Like to him it’s like… like it’s not over yet, you know. Like in his mind he’s going to get a call… Like any minute he’s getting a phone call. If the coach of the Giants doesn’t call him like, “Hey, man. “Eli’s hurt… You still got that football in your car?” I’m trying to kind of ',\n",
       "  'take responsibility for my part in being crazy, you know? I’m trying to be more mature in relationships, and I don’t think that it’s just women who are biologically fixed to be crazy… I don’t think that’s it. I think there’s a lot of socialization that messes us up, too. Like I realize I have incredibly high expectations for romance, and I don’t even know where they come from. Like I realized recently when I get off a plane, I fully expect the guy that I’m dating to be waiting for me at the airport, surprising me. What shitty movie did we see… You know what? I actually… I think it was Crocodile Dundee… I swear to God. Remember in the ’90s all those guys were like just rushing to the airport? Because as an adult, today, I will fully get off a plane. I will go on the escalator and I will be like… Fucking asshole. Which is so unfair to you guys, you know? Because if you guys were to actually do that, it would be a complete disaster. If the guy I was dating showed up at the airport when I got off the plane, all tired and sticky and shit, I’d be like, dude, what the fuck are you doing? He’d be like oh, I just, you know, wanted to come surprise you at the airport. I’d be like, you drove to the airport? I drove to the airport. Now we have two cars at the fucking airport! What lot are you in? You’re in lot B? We have to take a bus to your lot? Oh, you piece of shit! That’s crazy, you know, but I think there are a lot of things that contribute to us being a little irritable, you know? I think that part of girls being crazy is the fact that being a female is just so frustrating. Like there’s so much work we have to do, there’s so much maintenance that goes into it, and most of what we do is to make you guys think we’re attractive, so we’re resentful, you know. I feel like by 9 AM we already hate you. Okay? Because of all this shit we have to do from 8 to 9 AM to make you think we’re fuckin’ pretty. Like do you know the kind of shit that goes on in your bathroom, sir? You don’t know. You’re wearing shorts. And what are those… are those Crocs? Oh my God, white people are so embarrassing. Unbelievable! And she… you don’t understand the kind of stuff that goes on in the bathroom. She’s working hard and you’re wearing… your pajamas. This is unbelievable. Do you realize the things that we do? We spray aerosol. We inhale aerosol every day. Okay? Then we put on makeup which is just chemicals and poison… then we put on perfume which is pure alcohol. It’s not that we bitchy… we’re just high… most of the time. Bitches are just lit up everywhere. Have you ever seen a girl put on perfume. She’s like eh, eh, eh… Ah-h-h. Okay, let’s go. Where we going? The torture we put ourselves through… it’s just annoying, you know? Like do you know what eyeliner is, sir? Do you have any idea? A little bit. A little bit, little bit, little bit. Sorry, I can’t stop looking at your scrotum. Unbelievable! Eyeliner… no idea. Just based on the word eye…liner. Zero? Nothing. Zip. Guys don’t even know. Do you have any idea, sir? – I can take a hint. – You can take a hint. Okay, let’s see. You apply it to your eye. See, this is… he’s my worst nightmare. This is my worst nightmare. This is literal guy. This is the guy who in a fight, he just sticks to the facts. To win… he’s the guy who’s like, “No, no, no I didn’t say you were a bitch. I said you were being a bitch.” And you’re like, okay, I got to go regroup… I’ll be right back. Does any guy know how eyeliner is applied? This amazes me. The guy has no idea. With a brush. With a brush… no! That’s another masochistic thing we do. That’s eye shadow… it’s applied with a brush. The point of eye shadow is to make us look like we have black eyes, so why don’t you take a good hard look at yourself and why you think that’s attractive, sickos. I can’t do eye shadow myself. It’s actually difficult to do. I just have to be like baby, can you punch me in the face? I’m going to work. Eyeliner… nothing. This is amazing to me. Eyeliner. What’s that? Do you know how? With a pen? No! What else, what’s close to pen? – A pencil. – Pencil! Doesn’t that s',\n",
       "  'ound a little fucking dangerous to anybody else? We’re putting pencils in our eyeballs. Like I think the first thing you learn as a child is do not get a pencil near your eye… until you become an adult woman… in which case we want you to put it inside your eyeball every morning. We know you’re probably going to do it while you’re driving. We don’t care… only way to get a man to like you. I was worried that it was taking some kind of toll on our eyesight, like collectively as women, you know. I feel like putting ink and pencils and dye… this has got to be bad for our vision. You know, sometimes women see shit that’s just not fucking there. I think there’s a correlation. I used to always accuse my ex of checking out hot chicks in front of me. He’d be like what chicks… I don’t see any chicks. I’d be like I don’t know, motherfucker. I don’t have any peripheral vision anymore, from all this eyeliner. I see hot chicks everywhere. So much suffering. There’s so much pain involved in being a girl, you know? I don’t think women are weak. I think women are too strong because we just endure it. We just take it and don’t complain about it, but I do think that it manifests in other ways. Like next time you’re talking to a girl and you think she’s acting like shitty or unreasonable, just remember that she’s got a polyester string in her asshole. Yeah, she’s probably a little stressed out, okay? We’re all a little on edge, and I think that’s probably why. A guy will be like what’s up your ass? I’m like uh-h-h. I can tell you right now, it’s a polyester string I paid $35 for. That I can’t even put in the fucking dryer. Do you have a question? I can’t do a lot of it, you know. I can’t do high heels. I cannot do high heels because I feel like it makes me shitty. I get in a bad mood when I’m wearing high heels, you know. It’s just so weird to me. Some of you guys are here with girls tonight whose feet are bleeding. But you’re not doing anything about it. It’s not even weird… you’re not getting them a Band-Aid, nothing. It’s just accepted that we like limp around, you know. I also don’t like it because I feel like when I do, the guy that I’m with will get mad at me for wearing heels, you know? He’ll go why are you wearing those high-heeled shoes? It’s going to ruin our whole night because you’re going to be complaining the entire time about your feet hurting and I’m going to have to go get the car and pull the car around. Like um, hey bro, I’m wearing heels so that you want to fuck me. Because if I don’t, you’re going to leave me for someone who does. I’ve seen porn, and none of those bitches are wearing Aerosoles. Just go get the car. Like I’m always trying to look good for guys and it’s always backfiring on me, you know? Like when I’m taking too long in the bathroom… you’re taking forever in the bathroom. We’re going to miss our reservation. I’m like I’m sorry… I’m just in here trying to make you think I’m pretty. I’m not in a huge rush to get to the restaurant. It’s not like I can eat anything once we get there anyway. I’m fucking starving to death. I haven’t had bread since ’95, so just be cool, man. Then we get in trouble for that. Why are you always on a diet? You’re always on a diet. I’m on a diet because I’m trying to get the body of the women you jerk off to after I fall asleep. It’s not just that I love lettuce. Okay? I don’t love lettuce. What is the confusion. It’s always something, man. Why are you always cold? Why are you always cold? You’re always cold. I’m cold because I lasered my entire body… so that you would think I’m soft, you fucking pedophile. Unbelievable! Actually, there’s a lot of stuff you guys don’t know. You know there’s a lot of stuff you guys don’t know and I feel like if you knew about it, you’d be a little less frustrated with us, you know? Like there’s so much stuff you guys don’t know. Like you guys don’t know about the voices. No one told you about that shit, huh? You think it’s bad when our mouths are moving… no, that’s the best case scenario. It’s when our mouths are shut that you need to be concerned. Because that means ',\n",
       "  'we’re fucking thinking. That’s when all the problems start. Because I feel like in this culture girls are taught to be so self-critical. You know, we compare ourselves to such an impossible physical ideal that we’re always judging ourselves. You know, I’m so insecure at this point I just have this constant inner monologue saying the meanest shit to me all the time. It’s just like, “Hey, Whitney, “your thighs are touching… “You probably shouldn’t have had that cheese “last night, you fuckin’ pig. “You haven’t gone to the gym yet today… “that’s an interesting choice. “I guess you’re just going to die alone. “Even if a man does marry you, you’re so loud he’s going to leave you for an Asian girl.” Just the meanest stuff, constantly. But I feel like guys don’t have that same insecurity, you know? Obviously. I don’t think guys are self-critical like that. I feel like guys doing a monologue is totally different. I feel like guys doing a monologue are like, “What’s up, bro? “Looking awesome! “Really killing it today, per usual. “Dude, I don’t think you need to shave today… “that weird black hair growing out of your back looks cool. “Dude, do not shave your face. “Fuck your girlfriend and her bloody chin. “Fuck her! “Dude, I’m thinking you should wear “those awesome cargo shorts again today. With socks and sandals.” Must be nice. Must be nice to like yourselves. I feel like I spend so much time trying to figure out what guys are thinking about, you know? That’s like our favorite thing to do as girls, right… ask guys what they’re thinking, you know? “Hey babe, what are you thinking about… ” it’s always the same shit, right? “Nothin’.” Like we got to stop doing that. That has never gone well for any girl. Like no girl in the history of time was ever like “Hey babe, what are you thinking about…” And the guy was like, “Well… …I’m glad you asked. “I was just thinking about how young you look “and how much I love monogamy. Can we talk about it?” No, it’s always the same shit, right? “Nothin’.” But, you know what… I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that I think guys really do think about fuckin’ nothing. Like I feel like guys drive down the street and this is pretty much what goes on in your mind. Driving down the street just in your car… “Tree. “Tree. Damn, she’s got big tits.” But then that’s pretty much it. Right? If there’s no emotion, it’s just like thing, thing, stuff, thing, thing, stuff, thing.\\nBut for me to drive down that same street, nightmare. Stress. Memories, emotions, triggering. So much drama. For me to drive down that same street, it’s like, Oh my God, look at that tree. My ex-boyfriend had a tree in his yard. Oh my God! I miss him so much. Oh, look at that tree. That tree’s thinner than me. What the fuck… I hate trees. Well, who’s this bitch with the big tits? And that’s just to get to Rite-Aid. It’s just a saga. You know, I was explaining this to a guy friend of mine. I was explaining this to a guy friend of mine and I was just telling him, you know, that I think that being a girl is just more of a challenge sometimes because we have more to think about, you know. We have to worry about all this superficial stuff… our, you know, nails getting done, our hair, our clothes and matching and purses and stuff. He’s like “Yeah, yeah, but that’s not our fault. “That’s not our fault because women don’t dress for men. Women dress for other women.” Does anyone fuck… I will fight you right now… All of you. Women do not dress for other women. That’s such a ridiculous philosophy. Look, I’ve never been getting ready putting on a miniskirt like yeah, my waitress tonight is going to love this. Like, no, women do not dress for other women and I know this because I have girls’ nights in my house. And when girls are alone and no guys are around, we look like sea creatures. Okay? It looks like a pirate ship crashed into my house. Okay? We all got dreadlocks, we’re wearing slankets around, pajama jeans, all our leg hairs just in corn rows. We have our dicks hanging out. If a girl comes over with makeup on, I’m like, “Bitch, go wash your face. Whose te',\n",
       "  'am are you on?” I do think this idea, though, is kind of at the root of the philosophy that people think that women don’t like other women. I think that happens because when we’re super dressed up to impress a guy and we see each other, we avoid each other because we’re so embarrassed of all the pathetic, desperate shit we’re doing to impress a dude. You know, like when I’m super dressed up in a push-up bra and a mini dress and heels and I see a group of girls, I’m not like, “What’s up, bitches? I don’t think you’re ready for this jelly.” No! When I see a group of girls, I’m so humiliated at all the dumb, slutty shit I’m doing, I’m like, “Oh God, hi. “Um… “I know this is bad. “It’s just that he’s really shallow and um, “I’m in my 30’s now, so I’ve got to make a move, “you know what I mean… and he’s got a 401k… you get it.” I don’t like that idea that women don’t like other women. I don’t think that’s true. I just think that women support other women when it really counts. You know, we come in and have each other’s back when it really counts… like when we go to the bathroom together. You want to know what’s going on in there? There’s one girl having a bad night, a bunch of bitches who have never met each other in their lives are like soldiers at war, nursing each other’s wounds. One girl is on the floor… I’m like, all right, pull those Spanx up. Somebody get a Band-Aid for that blister. Someone… her eyebrow just melted off… gotta get a Sharpie to draw that shit back on. All right, someone get some Super Glue for those eye lashes. Her hair extensions just fell out… someone get a stapler to staple that horsehair back on her head. Now, bitch, you wipe the tears off your tits and you listen to me right now. You’re going to go back out there, put a smile on your face and pretend he’s interesting. Go! Thank you! I don’t like that at all. I think when women are nasty with other women, it’s much more subtle, like it’s much more insidious, you know. Like I have this girlfriend, every time I see her, she’d be like, “Hey, hooker. ‘s up, slut?” Which that’s never going to feel good, you know? But to me it’s just a reminder that I think we need to stop using the word hooker as a pejorative term. I have a lot of respect for hookers. I think they work very hard and they do a lot of the jobs that we don’t want to fucking do. They are cleaning up a lot of messes out there. They are American heroes. I also think hookers look at us like we’re the idiots, you know? They look at us and they’re like, “Those bitches are having sex for free? What a bunch of fuckin’ whores.” So silly. I don’t know, man. I feel like when I was trying to figure out what guys were thinking about, I came across some stuff that was just too discouraging, you know. Like I came across an article that said that guys think about sex at least every five minutes. Was that like disturbing, right? Like you guys are responsible for like really important shit like wars and bombs, and you guys can’t focus for five fucking minutes… Like important men are thinking about sex every five minutes which is like Barack Obama thinks about sex every five minutes which probably explains why he’s always stuttering during his fucking speeches. It’s like, dude, get your shit together, man, you know? But you’ll see it happen. You’ll see him giving a speech and you’ll see that five-minute mark hit. You’ll see sex enter his mind. He’ll be like, “We’re going to go into Afghanistan “and we’re going to discuss the… “um, we’re going to, “ah, we’re going to get on the, uh, Dude, I just saw that, man. You were just thinking about titties… Afghan titties. I saw it happen.\\nIt’s just concerning to me. I feel like there are a lot of jobs where you guys probably need to focus, right? Like heart surgeons think about sex every five minutes and heart surgeries are like five hours long, so that’s like 60 times. Like you know heart surgeons are just sitting there looking at an open heart like yeah, I’d put my dick in that. I said it.\\nIt’s kind of weird, though, that guys think about sex. Like we’ve accepted it so much as a socie',\n",
       "  'ty now. You know, it’s so institutionalized. We’ve embraced it, you know. Like there’s just a restaurant called Hooters… that’s just a restaurant. Whereas there would never be a restaurant like that for women, you know, called like Dongs. Where all the waiters were like in Speedos and shit because that would be a disgusting fucking restaurant. Nobody would ever eat there. We do not want to see your flaccid dicks in spandex… I gotta be honest. It looks like a hamster stuck in a water balloon. No. No. So it’s like some weird shitake mushroom coming out… It’s always going up like a snorkel. Like why is it up? Get it down there! It’s always like on one side, all mis… why is it so misallocated? Disgusting.\\nLike if there was going to be a restaurant like that for women where the waiters were dressed up to arouse the women eating there, they would not be in Speedos, okay? They’d be wearing suits, carrying briefcases, holding up their perfect credit reports. Like I feel like girls don’t need like sex while we’re doing our jobs, you know. Right? Like you would never turn on the Cooking Channel and see like a bunch of shirtless dudes like yeah, girl, ooh, yeah, yeah. Just put that butter on the pan, girl. Just get it in the roast. I just realized I don’t know anything about cooking. Did you see the wheels just turning there? Like it wasn’t even clo… Roast? No one does a roast anymore. I’m going to work on that. You guys just need sex all the time. Like in completely nonsexual situations, guys need sex, you know. Like sports, perfect example. Football. You guys are watching football and you’ve got these amazing athletes on the field doing amazing things, incredible. They’re flying, they’re doing phenomenal things. Not enough for you. You still need whores around the perimeter… of the field. God forbid there’d be two seconds without a tit in the background of something you’re watching. Cheerleaders crack me up, man. So funny to me because that’s so obviously a guy’s idea, you know. Like a guy obviously thought of that because the cheerleaders still cheer even when their team is fucking losing… they cheer. No real women would ever act like that. If her man was out on the field for five hours on a Sunday bombing, she wouldn’t be like go, baby, go, go. She’d be like Jason, we’re leaving. First of all, you’re embarrassing me, okay? Second of all, I’m freezing cold, I have to pee, and Target closes in 20 minutes. Wrap it up. I think I figured out why guys like sex more. I think it’s biological. I think it’s because sex is so much better for guys. You know, it’s so much easier. Like for a guy… sex is better for guys because it’s so much easier for you guys to have an orgasm. You know, like for a guy to have an orgasm, it’s just like… it’s like you just… Pretty much all that has to happen is you just have to kind of walk into something or… There has to be like a drizzle out, you know. Which, by the way, I have narrowed down men’s orgasms to three basic categories. Like there’s three basic ones… The first one is like you just got shot in the back with an arrow… The second one is like you’re puking… And the third one is a rare one, but it’s for the guys that are like secretly psychos and they hate women and it’ll come out like right at the finish line, you know, like out of nowhere. They’ll be like yeah, I love you, I need you, yeah. Shut up, you dumb whore! I’m like, oh no! I thought we were in love.\\nYou know for a woman to have an orgasm it is so hard… it is so hard to have an orgasm. It’s… I cannot wait to have one. I hear they’re great. I mean seriously, for a girl to have an orgasm, you’ve got to be like… you’ve got to be like focused. You have to be like emotionally connected. You’ve got to be relaxed. You’ve got to be in great shape, and it makes it even harder because you guys watch porn and you think that the porn stars are having orgasms, but they’re all faking it and they make it look so fucking easy. Like porn stars will be just like’ “Ooh, I’m coming, I’m coming, I’m coming.” That’s nothing. That’s she’s coming down from a meth binge. Nothing’s h',\n",
       "  'appening to her. I can’t compete with that, you know.\\nLike if your girl is having an orgasm, she’s not going ooh, I’m coming, I’m coming. If your girl is having an orgasm, she’s going’ “Do not fucking move!” I swear to God, I will fucking kill you. Bastard! Slower. Tell me you love me… you better fucking mean it this time! Kiss me on the mouth, goddamnit! Pull my hair, not the extensions! Shut up, you dumb whore!\\nSeriously, for me to have an orgasm, like my right leg has to be behind my left shoulder… Like you’ve got a charleyhorse in your ass, you know. You got those crazy bloodshot eyes going, veins in our foreheads. Our foreheads look like your dicks… just veins…\\nI know it’s not easy for you guys, either. Now you guys have to like do so much work. You guys have to hit the same spot like 500 times, you know. That’s why I like to be helpful during sex, you know. That’s why I treat sex like the game “Operation”. If the guy misses, I’m just like… I used to be very against porn, you know. I thought it was bad for women and like degrading and shit, but now I kind of like it. Uh, because you know why… because I watched it, and when I watched it, I learned so much stuff that I had to be kind of grateful for it. I learned watching porn that the girls in porn they’ll request to the man where they want him to finish which I didn’t know that was an option. See, nobody told me that we had a vote in that. I’ve just been taking whatever shots have been coming at me… since 1998… I don’t know. I feel like I’ve been storming the shores of Normandy… That’s a history joke. I don’t know. Now that I know that’s an option… to request where you’d want the man to finish… I’m I’m ready. Now I’ve got some ideas. Maybe like, yeah, I really want you to come… In the bathroom? You just want to time that out… whatever you’ve got to do to just… In the sink! I like the big one, though.\\nThe big one in porn is the coming on the face. That’s the big one, right? Yeah. Let’s talk about it. Like I really think that as a society we kind of need to discuss why we like this so much, you know, and why you guys think that we like love it. Like who told you that we like need it? No, nobody ever wants this to happen to them. If a girl asks you to come on her face, it’s because she thinks you’re going to breakup with her. Always buys you at least another month or so. My problem with it is like the second it’s over. You know, I try to be fun. You know while it’s happening I can get into it, you know, because while it’s happening you can be like yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah. Look at us. Yeah, hit me, hit me. Yeah, ooh, yeah. We are so crazy. We are wild and crazy… Can I get like a towel or something? Or maybe like a baby wipe or some… or maybe like a pick ax because now it’s turned to stone. I can’t open my fucking eyes. He’s not going to help you. He’s too busy taking photos to send his friends. You guys are animals. But I get why guys watch porn. I get it now because it’s so obvious. It’s just that naked women are hot. All naked women are hot. You know, there’s so much to look at, yeah. It’s disgusting of you. You’re with a date, man. That’s going to be a fight. But, right? All boobs and butts… they all look amazing, you know? That’s why you guys watch porn. Girls don’t watch porn as much because naked guys… uck! Such a bummer, you know. It’s just such a… this whole Wes Craven situation you got going on… it’s just disgusting, you know. It’s a lot… it’s a lot to take. Because like when a dick comes on the screen, we’re not like yeah, “Look at that dick. Yeah, I want that dick.” No. When a dick comes on the screen, we’re like, “Oh, there’s a dick. “What’s it doing? “What’s the dick doing? Does it see me? Does the dick see me?” Like there’s just nothing attractive about it, you know. Like dicks are so ugly… that the second you guys are born, someone has to cut some of it off. To make it even somewhat presentable to society. You guys love your dicks though, man, you love them. You’re going yeah! Dicks! You guys walk around, you lead with it. Lead with it, just walking around, just lettin',\n",
       "  'g it go. Yeah, just loving my dick. You know when you guys are alone, you’re just like… You guys walk around so proud of it. You guys walk around like you got a first place trophy in-between your legs. I got news for you… it doesn’t look like a first place trophy. Looks like an old yam. Have you seen it? Have you… you know what… no, you haven’t seen it because your hand is always on it. You’ve never actually seen it before. Always touchin’ it. Always touchin’ it, touchin’ it, touchin’ it. What do you… what are you do… Are you cleaning it off, like are you trying to get three wishes out of it? Leave it alone. Just let it just dry off.\\nYou know what that means, right? You’re always touching your dicks. You know what that means… you got dick on your hands… all of you. You have dick, dick, dick, dick, dicking hands. All of you. You see guys know that. Guys are in on it. That’s why guys are always giving each other the fist pump. They know, you know. Did you ever see two guys walk towards each other? Like hey man, what’s up, man? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. I’ve been touching my dick today, too, man. Yeah, we both got dicks. We got dicks. Like that’s like your whole day. Just like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh. That’s the trick. That is the trick of dating is that when you get back out there, you’ve got to see all these new dicks, you know? I know, it’s a lot. Like when you live with someone for a while or you’re married, you get used to their dick, you know? It’s like it grows on you. It’s like a basset hound… like it’s ugly but it’s yours. You know. It’ll come over and like hey, what are you doing? You’re like hi, dick, what’s u-up? Do you want to hang out? No, not really. But when you’re single, man, you’ve got to see all these new dicks. You know, you’ve got to, you’ve got to really get in there, you know. But the problem is when you see a new dick because every new dick is a whole new set of WebMD searches. You know. You’ve got to inspect the new ones. You’ve got to make sure everything’s legit. You’ve got to make sure everything’s, you know, safe. You know, but the problem is when you get that close to a dick, you’re that close to a dick. You know what happens when you’re that close to a dick. Yeah. You’ve got to put that thing in your mouth. And it’s not because we want to… it’s because something happens when a woman’s face is within like a foot of a man’s dick where a hand will come down… And you can’t get out… it moves with you. Oh shit! Fine! That is so rude!\\nMan, I don’t mean to be mean about it… I just feel like you guys don’t see it from our perspective, you know. You don’t see what we see. You know, we’ve got to see this super weird transformation happen that is so creepy, you know. Here’s the thing… anything that changes in shape, size, and color without your permission is a little fucking weird. You know. Like from our point of view, it is terrifying. Like this is what it looks like from our point of view, just so you guys know. Okay, it’ll start out just hanging, chilling. You’re touchin’ it, touchin’ it. Then you’re like… it’ll hear like a noise or… Um? “Would you like to play?” I love you guys. Thank you so much for coming down for the show, everybody. Thank you. I just want to say I really appreciate you guys coming out. Standup is my favorite thing to do in the world and I do it for you guys. So, thank you so much for supporting me. I love you very much.

       "[['Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage: Ali Wong! Hi. Hello! Welcome! Thank you! Thank you for coming. Hello! Hello. We are gonna have to get this shit over with, ’cause I have to pee in, like, ten minutes. But thank you, everybody, so much for coming. Um… It’s a very exciting day for me. It’s been a very exciting year for me. I turned 33 this year. Yes! Thank you, five people. I appreciate that. Uh, I can tell that I’m getting older, because, now, when I see an 18-year-old girl, my automatic thought… is “Fuck you.” “Fuck you. I don’t even know you, but fuck you!” ‘Cause I’m straight up jealous. I’m jealous, first and foremost, of their metabolism. Because 18-year-old girls, they could just eat like shit, and then they take a shit and have a six-pack, right? They got that-that beautiful inner thigh clearance where they put their feet together and there’s that huge gap here with the light of potential just radiating through. And then, when they go to sleep, they just go to sleep. Right? They don’t have insomnia yet. They don’t know what it’s like to have to take a Ambien or download a Meditation Oasis podcast to calm the chatter of regret and resentment towards your family just cluttering your mind. They have their whole lives ahead of them. They don’t have HPV yet. They just go to sleep in peace at night. Everybody has HPV, OK? Everybody has it. It’s OK. Come out already. Everybody has it. If you don’t have it yet, you go and get it. You go and get it. It’s coming. You don’t have HPV yet, you’re a fucking loser, all right? That’s what that says about you. A lot of men don’t know that they have HPV, because it’s undetectable in men. It’s really fucked up. HPV is a ghost that lives inside men’s bodies and says, “Boo!” in women’s bodies. My doctor told me that I have one of two strains of HPV. Either I have the kind that’s gonna turn into cervical cancer… …or I have the kind where my body will heal itself. Very helpful, this doctor, right? So, basically, either I’m gonna die… or you’re in the presence of Wolverine, bitches. We’ll find out. Um, I can also tell that I’m getting older, because my Kindle is turning into a self-help library. I’m not interested in books like Fifty Shades of Grey, OK? I’m interested in The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up. Yes. Yes, that’s right, how to declutter my home to achieve inner peace and my optimum level of success. That’s what your 30s is all about. How can I turn this shit around? I’m a horrible person, I’m not happy with where I am, how can I turn this shit around? Help me, Tony Robbins, help me!\\nI have a hoarding problem, which I’m hoping is the center of all of my other problems. I’m hoping that if the hoarding goes away, the HPV will also disappear. I have a hoarding problem because my mom is from a third world country and she taught me that you can never throw away anything, because you never know when a dictator’s gonna overtake the country and snatch all your wealth. So, you better hold onto that retainer from the third grade, ’cause it might come in handy as a shovel when you’re busy stuffing gold up your butt and running away from the Communists.\\nThe last time I was at home in San Francisco, I was trying to help her get rid of shit. Don’t ever do that with your mom. It was like the worst experience of my life. It was so emotional. We were screaming and fighting and yelling and it all came to a climax when she refused to let go of a Texas Instruments TI-82… manual. The manual. She don’t even know… where the calculator is. Those of you under 25 probably don’t know what that calculator is. It was this calculator that bamboozled my generation. We were all required to buy it when we were in eight grade. It cost like $200. And everybody thought it was like this Judy Jetson’s laptop from the future. All because what? It could graph. It was like the Tesla of my time. And my mom got so emotional about the manual and she was like, “You never know when you might need this.” And I was like, “But… I do know… that I’m gonna have to clean all this shit up when you die.” “And I’m not trying to be a procrastinator anymore. Because according to Deepak-Oprah, that’s not the way for me to achieve my optimum level of success.” I grew up a lot this past year. Uh, this past year I also got married. Yeah. To a man who now has HPV. Very lucky guy. He gave me something. I gave him something. That will also last forever. No, really. I’m the lucky girl, because before him, I dated a lot of losers. Lots of losers. A lot of skaters. You wanna be a grown-ass woman, stop dating skaters. Stop dating skaters unless you wanna wake up on a mattress in a kitchen. They’re sexy on the outside, malt liquor on the inside. Horrible. But my husband, I first met him at this wedding and, uh, he’s– he’s much better looking than me, he’s way out of my league, and I saw him and I was like, “Oh, my God, who is that?” And the first thing I learned about him was that, at the time, he was attending Harvard Business School. And I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna trap his ass.” “Going to trap his ass!” And I trapped his ass initially by not kissing him until the fifth date, which is a very unusual move on my part. But I did it on purpose, because I knew that he was a catch. So I was like, “All right, Ali, you gotta make this dude believe that your body is a secret garden.” When, really, it’s a public park… …that has hosted many reggae fests… …and has even accidentally let… two homeless people inside. I thought they were hipsters, OK? That store Urban Outfitters has made things very confusing… for my generation. You homeless or you a hipster? Is that beard for fashion or for warmth? It happened to… It happened in San Francisco, when I was living there, and I saw this guy in broad daylight and we had, like, we had… We had so much chemistry. He was like, “Hey, wassup?” I was like, “Wassup?” And we– The next thing I knew, we were getting busy in the back of my Volvo. And then after we were done, he was like, “Hey, can you drop me off?” I was like, “Where?” He was like, “At the park.” And I dropped him off at Golden Gate Park and watched him run into the middle with all his other homeless friends, and I was like, “Oh, no!” “I just fucked a homeless dude! Again!” My husband is Asian. Which a lot of people are shocked by, because, usually, Asian-American women who, like, you know, wear these kinda glasses and have a lot of opinions, they like to date white dudes. You go to any hipster neighborhood in a major city in America and that shit is turning into a Yoko Ono factory. It’s… too much. I don’t know what’s wrong with these bitches. I get it, you know, because being with a white dude you feel very… You feel very picturesque when you’re with a white dude, you know. You feel like you’re in a Wes Anderson movie or something. And you know, white dudes, they teach you about a lot of cool stuff like voting and recycling, and disturbing documentaries. They introduce you to cool stuff like that and it’s very, you know, it’s hot hookin’ up with a white dude. I mean, nothing makes me feel more powerful than when a white dude eats my pussy. Oh, my God. I just feel like I’m absorbing all of that privilege and all of that entitlement… …you know, just right there, through the money hole and just… And then also, he’s so vulnerable down there. I’m, like, “I could just crush your head at any moment, white man! I could just kill you right now! Crush those brains! Colonize the colonizer!” You know? But I think that for marriage, it can be nice to be with somebody of your own race. The advantage is that you get to go home… and be racist together. You get to say whatever you like! You don’t gotta explain shit. My husband, half-Filipino, half-Japanese. I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. And we spend 100 percent of our time shitting on Korean people. It’s… amazing. It’s what love is built on, you kno',\n",
       "  'w? My last boyfriend was Cuban and his family would shit on Mexican people all the time. And I was like, “Hold it. You guys aren’t Mexican?” Asian-American men are very underrated. I don’t know why people don’t go for them. They’re the sexiest. Asian men are the sexiest. They got no body hair from the neck down. It’s like making love to a dolphin. Oh, my God. It’s so smooth, just like a slip and slide. Just black fish, Tilikum, all up in my bed every night, you know? Ooh-wee. You mess with a Jewish dude and your body is all fucked up afterwards. It’s all red and inflamed and you’re like, “I did not ask to be exfoliated today.” “This is the last time I go on J-date, more like loofah date. Thanks for the rug burn, Avi.” And then Asian men, no body odor. None. They just smell like responsibility. That’s where the umami flavor comes from. I think my husband and I have a huge unspoken understanding, uh, between each other, because he’s half-Filipino and half-Japanese and I’m half-Chinese and half-Vietnamese. So, we’re both half-fancy Asian… …and half-jungle Asian. Yeah! You guys know the difference. The fancy Asians are the Chinese, the Japanese. They get to do fancy things like host Olympics. Jungle Asians host diseases. It’s… It’s different. But he grew up on the East Coast, going to private school, playing lacrosse, uh, you know, learning Latin and playing chess and rugby. He grew up like Filipino Carlton, OK? So, he didn’t know anything about Vietnamese people until he met me. And on one of our first dates, he took me to this restaurant on the west side of Los Angeles called Pho Show. He was like, “It’s authentic Vietnamese. I read about it on Yelp!” I was like, “It’s not authentic, OK?” You can tell, first and foremost, by the name, ’cause it don’t got a number in it. Second of all, you can tell by the bathroom. If it was legit, the bathroom would double as a supply closet. When I pee, I need to see ten gallons of bleach, an ATM machine and a grandma with glaucoma napping in the corner. And the wait staff here is too nice. We need to leave this restaurant deaf and emotionally abused. I grew up going to private school, too. Him and I are both total, like, private school Asians. We both are big hippies, too. We like to backpack through Southeast Asia. We like to do yoga. We do ayahuasca ceremonies. We do silent meditation retreats. That’s right, we pay $800 to shut up for a weekend. We do shit like that. Uh, we eat gluten-free, which means we eat all that bread that tastes like free-range Chewbacca. We eat that lesbian bread that’s like… …a thousand percent of your daily fiber… and 20 percent spoken word poetry. When you eat it, you queef a shitty poem about… …supporting Caitlyn Jenner or whatever. And so, it’s funny, right, because he’s Asian, too. But sometimes, all of this hippy-dippy shit we do… makes me feel like we are white people doing an impression of Asian people. Like, we have these Chinese scrolls up on the wall… and neither of us know what the fuck they mean. We’re like, “Oh, that seems to go very well with our Buddha piggy bank from Pier 1 Imports. That seems to be providing some good feng shui for the house. Him and I had been dating for four years and I– I just had this sneaking suspicion that he was gonna propose… because… I had been pressuring him to do it. So, you know, I just had this wacky women’s intuition. That’s how proposals really work, OK? A woman has to incept the idea into the man’s head. First passively and then if he doesn’t get the message, extremely aggressively. You gotta threaten to leave without ever actually leaving, because you know that you’re too old and it’s too late to go back out there and find a new man and start the whole manipulation cycle all over again. So, you’re like, “I’m just gonna stick with this dude, focus on trapping this dude, and just nag the shit outta him until he becomes weak and caves in and gets fed up and is like, “Shut the fuck up! Fine, will you marry me?” And then afterwards, the woman is always, like, “Oh, my God! He proposed!” “It came outta nowhere. And look, he got me the exact ring I wanted. How did he know? Maybe he saw it on my Pinterest page or something… that I sent to my best friend, that I told her to send to him every day.” Let me tell you something. If a man has a Pinterest page… he’s probably Pinterested in men. We got engaged on a Saturday. I bought my wedding dress the following Tuesday… because I had tried it on in 2012. I was ready. I was ripe. I was rotten. I need to be made into banana bread. That’s how rotten I was. People are always very surprised at how, off-stage, with my husband, I’m a completely different person. You– Like, you would not recognize my personality at all with him. With him, I’m very soft, and, like, very nurturing and very domestic. We’ve been together now for five years, and for five years, I’ve packed his lunch every single day. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. I did that so that he’d become dependent on me. ‘Cause he graduated from Harvard Business School, and I don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t. I straight up don’t wanna work anymore. I don’t feed him out of the goodness of my heart. I do it as an investment in my financial future. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’ve been reading that book by Sheryl Sandberg, she’s the C.O.O. of Facebook, and she wrote that book that got women all riled up about our careers. Talking about how we as women should challenge ourselves to sit at the table and rise to the top. And her book is called Lean In. Well, I don’t wanna lean in, OK? I wanna lie down. I want to lie the fuck down. I think feminism is the worst thing that ever happened to women. Our job used to be no job. We had it so good. We could have done the smart thing, which would have been to continue playing dumb for the next century and be like, “We’re dumb women. We don’t know how to do anything. So, I guess we better just stay at home all day and eat snacks and watch Ellen.” “‘Cause we’re too stupid to have any real responsibility.” And then, all these women had to show off and be like, “We could do it! We could do anything.” “Bitch, shut up!” “Don’t tell them the secret.” They ruined it for us, and now we’re expected to work. When I hear the phrase, “Double-income household,” I wanna throw up. A lot of women get very upset with me about those comments. And they’re like, “But, Ali, we have so many more options now.” Oh, you don’t think we had a lot of options when our day was free? Unscheduled, unsupervised, and most importantly, sponsored? Do you know how much shittier food tastes when you know you have to earn it? A lot of my friends, when we walk around together, they’ll get very judgmental about housewives that we’ll see on the street. And they’ll be like, “Look at that fucking housewife. Not doing anything. Look at that housewife, just walking around all day, getting massages in her Lululemon pants.” I’m like, “That bitch is a genius.” “She’s not a housewife, she’s retired.” I do write for Fresh Off the Boat on ABC. Yeah. Which is… It’s a great show. I love it a lot. I love my co-workers. It’s a great writing staff and in terms of day jobs, it’s probably one of the best you could ask for, but I still gotta work at a office every day. Which means I gotta shit in a office every day. Housewives, they don’t gotta shit in a office. Housewives get to shit in their house. Skin to seat. They don’t gotta use that horrible toilet paper cover. They don’t gotta… …ten times a day, every day… like you’re about to eat a sad-ass meal. They don’t gotta do that. They don’t gotta use that one-ply toilet paper, that office toilet paper, that they purposely make difficult to pull out. They try to ration me with their communist toilet paper that’s not even effective. It basically just dehydrates your butt hole. It’s basically like wiping your butt with the desert. I literally spat on my toilet paper ',\n",
       "  \"two days ago, to try to make a MacGyver baby wipe, to moisten it, and then it backfired ’cause my fingers broke through and digitally stimulated more doo doo to come out, and then I had to start all over again. And you can never finish wiping at work because you always feel rushed ’cause you’re paranoid that your co-worker’s gonna recognize your shoes underneath the stall. And you’re like, “Oh, no! Courtney’s listening. She’s waiting. She’s timing me.” And then you hurry, hurry, hurry, and then you never finish wiping and then your butt hole feels caked in doo doo all day long. And then if you dare scratch yourself, your underwear at the end of the day looks like it’s been run over by the Goonies. Housewives, they don’t gotta muffle their shit, too. They don’t gotta worry about the velocity with which their doo doo comes out. They don’t gotta try to, you know, squeeze the butt cheeks together to make sure that the doo doo comes out at a slow and steady pace, so that no unpredictable noise suddenly escapes and brings you deep, deep shame. Housewives are free to just blow ass into the toilet and let it echo and reverberate to the ends of their hallways while watching as much Netflix on their iPad as they want. They don’t gotta take these boring, repressed shits. They can listen to podcasts. Planet Money. They can do whatever they want. You know, it’s– it’s very distracting for me when I hear my co-workers blow ass into the toilet. I lose respect for them. Nothing they say to me anymore holds any sort of credence. I heard one of my co-workers blow ass into the toilet the other day. This bitch had the nerve to come up to me and say, “You need to get to work on time.” I was like, “You need to eat bananas.” “I saw those green ballet flats. I know that shit was you. Don’t try to tell me to get my shit together when I heard you not have your shit together.” My father-in-law had this huge sit-down with me and my husband recently. Um, and he was like, “Hey, I wanna talk to you guys about money. You guys need to make a lot more money if you wanna provide your children with the same kind of privileged childhood that you guys had.” I was like, “Why you telling me this shit? I should not be a part of this conversation. You tell you son that. Don’t your understand that I trapped your son for his earning potential? Why else would I choose to fuck one person for the rest of my life? I chose to marry him on the promise of early retirement, and when I said, ‘I do,’ what I really meant was, ‘Oh, I’m done.'” I’m done. I don’t wanna work anymore and I’m not dieting anymore. Since I got married last year, I’ve been eating fried chicken skin every day since. That’s right. And just fulfilling my destiny. Which is to turn into a circle with eyelashes. Like Mrs. Pacman, just… Let’s redecorate. I gave up a lot of myself when I got married. I’m a– I’m a disgusting pervert. I’m a pervert. I’m a gross filthy animal. And I think it’s because I started watching porn at a very young age. And what happens when you start watching porn at a young age is that… y-you get sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The images you crave get sicker, and sicker, and sicker, but it’s OK, because the Internet will always catch up to you. I broke up with my last boyfriend because he refused to put it in the back. I was like, “Uh, you’re a idiot, dude. Do you realize that if I went on Craigslist… and posted ‘Tiny Asian female seeking anal…’ the Internet would crash.” “And all the Jewish male heads in the universe would simultaneously explode.” They would explode. A lot of women get really, you know… freaked out about anal. And they’re like, “Oh, I don’t wanna do that. I’m scared of– of the pain.” You ain’t scared of the pain. Women, they wax their eyebrows, they do all sorts of crazy shit. You’re not scared of the pain. What you’re really scared of is doo doo on the dick. You’re scared that he’s gonna see that and that’s gonna be all of your shame, your inner evil, all your secrets and lies. Sephora can’t help you now. But don’t worry, ’cause when he puts it in the butt, all he’s thinking about is, “I just put it in her butt.” “I gotta go call my mom, my dad, Dave, my grandma.” You’re– If you’re married, you’re gonna have to do anal eventually, OK? You have to, because you gotta change it up. You gotta change it up, so that you don’t cheat on each other. You gotta keep it interesting. If you put it in different holes, maybe you’ll feel like you’re fucking different people. I was very sexually active in my 20s, and as a result, I’m a little bit… …stretched out down there, OK? So, when I finally did anal, I just felt like I got a second chance at life, you know? I was, like, “Oh, my God! It’s like I’m going back in time!” ♪ A whole new world ♪ It was magical. A big fantasy of mine before I got married was to help as many men as possible discover their prostate. Yeah, like a conqueror. I just wanted to… Now, if you haven’t done it before, ladies, go home and treat yourself. Do it tonight. You only live once. YOLO. Just sneak your– Just give your man a little– a little push-push in the tush-tush. Just give him a little Atari, you know, and you’ll get a lot of resistance from the man at first. You’ll get a lot of “No! No! No! No, please! No, really, I don’t– No! I don’t! I don’t! No!” They get all squirmy wormy because… they’re scared. They’re scared that if you stick your thumb up there and succeed, and they like it, that then, it might mean that they’re gay. And I like that fear. That shit turns me on, you know? Especially when that fear metamorphosizes into pleasure. Oh, my God! And you just see the look in the man’s eye like he’s discovered nirvana. And it’s like you’re the first lady to show him that he had a magical clit in his butt hole. And then, you as the woman, in his eyes, just become the Lord of the Rim, you know? My husband is unfortunately just not as freaky as me. When– When I’ve asked him to spank me, this is what he does. “Hey. Hey, are you OK? Are you all right? You know I respect you, right?” I’m, like, “Yes, I know you respect me and that’s why you need to abuse me. OK?” ‘Cause it’s the most strong-headed, loud-mouthed women who like to be abused the most in bed. Women who are C.E.O.s, they just wanna be roughed around. They just want their– Glasses always means the woman wants some– It’s because we’re so in control all the time, that we just wanna experience some risk and be out of control, you know? Like, “I don’t wanna die! Don’t kill me! I don’t wanna die!” But I also don’t want to be sure that I’m gonna live. You know? I just wanna be out of control for once. Just– Just choke me enough so that I can’t talk. ‘Cause if I can talk, I’m gonna tell you what to do. And I’m tired of being the boss. I’m the boss all the time, so, in the bedroom, you be the boss. Yes. Because I’m the real boss. And I told you so, motherfucker, so do it. Sheryl Sandberg, that woman who wrote Lean In, has had such a big impact that now, because of her, there is a ban on the word “bossy” in elementary schools, because according to her, it’s sexist to use the word “bossy,” because boys are never called bossy. So, now, instead of saying, “You’re bossy,” you’re supposed to say, “You have executive leadership skills.” Which is a very roundabout way of saying: “You’re a little cunt.” I’m just waiting for the right moment to, like, become a housewife, financially, you know? I want my husband to get us to, like, a certain point financially. I wanna get to the point as a couple where I can comfortably afford sliced mango. Know what I’m talking about? I’m talking about that Whole Foods mango. That $10-a-box Whole Foods mango that was sliced by white people. That’s the kind of income bracket I’m striving for. That’s when you know you’ve made it, when you’re eating mango that was sliced by a dude named Noah. I want Noah mango… …Rebecca kiwi, Danielle pin\",\n",
       "  \"eapple. You know what else I want? I wanna be able to take a stroll on a sidewalk, see a quarter, and just keep on walking. Like a princess. I have some useful advice for all my Asian-American brothers and sisters. Yeah! Never go paintballing with a Vietnam veteran. So, I don’t know if you guys can tell, but I am seven and a half months pregnant. Yeah. It’s very rare and unusual to see a female comic perform pregnant, because female comics… don’t get pregnant. Just try to think of one. I dare you. There’s– None of them. Once they do get pregnant, they generally disappear. That’s not the case with male comics. Once they have a baby, they’ll get up on stage a week afterwards and they’ll be like, “Guys, I just had this fucking baby. That baby’s a little piece of shit. It’s so annoying and boring.” And all these other shitty dads in the audience are, like, “That’s hilarious. I identify.” And their fame just swells because they become this relatable family funny man all of a sudden. Meanwhile, the mom is at home, chapping her nipples, feeding the fucking baby, and wearing a frozen diaper ’cause her pussy needs to heal from the baby’s head shredding it up. She’s busy. So, I don’t know what’s gonna happen to me. You know, a lot of my female stand-up comic friends who are a lot more successful and famous than me discouraged me from having a kid. And they were like, “Ali, why are you gonna have a kid? You just gonna become– You’re gonna disappear, and you’re gonna become some lame stay-at-home mom.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s the dream.” That’s the point. This is the ultimate trap. I won, you know? Another thing a lot of my friends said to me when they were discouraging me from having a kid, they were like, “Why are you gonna have a kid? Why don’t you just travel the world with your husband and just do whatever you want for the rest of your lives with no kid attached.” I was like, “Yeah, that’s cool… until my husband dies.” Which he’s definitely gonna before me. Because I’m a Asian woman, and therefore, guaranteed to live until I’m a billion. I’m guaranteed, like a turtle from the Galapagos, OK? We all know the phrase “black don’t crack.” Well, Asian don’t die. We don’t die. Especially the women, we live forever. And you know why we’re such bad drivers? Because we’re trying to die. We’re like, “Yeah! Let me see how invincible I really am!” “Imma make this left hand turn signal and ignore this red light completely.” “I’m gonna make a right turn– I changed my mind, it’s a U-turn!” “I changed my mind again. It’s a O-turn!” Every time I get into a car accident… …I’m like, “Oh, my God, not again!” I need to hide my face so that everybody doesn’t see that it’s what everybody thought it was gonna be. So embarrassing. My Toyota Corolla is a mess. There’s this huge bear claw scratch on the side from this aggressive brick wall that came out of nowhere. And then, on the hood, there’s multiple hand prints from pedestrians who have had to alert me of their existence. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, but I’m still here, you know? I need to have children to keep me company when I get older. It’s lonely. My mom is 80, going through a full blown mid-life crisis. ‘Cause she knows that she’s got a century more to go. And she is so lonely. All of her white friends, dead. Her Mexican friends, dead. Black friends, dead. I’m just kidding. She doesn’t have any black friends. Life is not Rush Hour, the movie, OK? I need children to be there for me when I’m older, when I get as old as her. And when I say be there for me, I mean pay for me when my husband isn’t around to support me anymore. I’m not trying to be one of those old Chinese ladies who recycles for a living. That’s not my destiny, OK? Old Chinese ladies, they don’t give a fuck. They got no shame. They’re like, “I’m just gonna recycle… go bald… go to the park, do this shit.” They do that ’cause it’s a free activity. For them. They do it in their– their big-ass V. Stiviano visor, their Darth Vader-Tomb Raider- Boba Fett helmet. They wear that to protect themselves from their arch-nemesis, the sun. Their in a contest to see who’s gonna burn out first. Old Asian ladies and the sun are like the Tupac and Biggie of longevity. I also decided to have a kid because uh, I’m only 33, which, I know, is not technically high-risk, but my body was starting to show signs of change. And it– And it scared me. Like, I’m only 33 and… …my pussy is not as wet as it used to be. It’s very demoralizing, OK? Do you remember when you were 18 years old, and your pussy was just sopping wet all the time? All the time, you just took it for granted that you could just reach your hand down your pants at any given moment, you throw up the peace sign afterwards, and there would be that snail-trail in between your fingers. Oh, my God, it was so juicy. You could just blow a bubble wand with it, just… “I slime you, I slime you. Ghostbusters!” I don’t know what kind of mother I’m gonna be. I’m– I’m 33, and I did have to get a little bit of science involved when trying to get pregnant. And a lot of that… is most likely my fault. Because, when I was in my 20s, I ate Plan B like skittles. So, my uterus probably looked like a smoker’s lung. And I found out that my progesterone levels were alarmingly low. So, then I had to take these hormone pills that were suppositories, and Push Pop them up myself every single night. And then, at my writing job, at Fresh Off The Boat, I would be storyboarding in front of my co-workers, and then, at some point, the pill would inevitably dissolve and melt into my underwear, and I had to act like everything was OK, when everything was clearly not OK. And then, a side effect of the progesterone was that it made me extremely itchy. So, then I had to find ways to discretely scratch myself underneath the conference table, and then resist the urge to immediately smell my fingers afterwards. I want to be able to smell my fingers when I wanna smell my own goddamn fingers. Housewives, they can just scratch and sniff all day long. They just vacuum, scratch, sniff. They make a sandwich. “Uh, mmm.” They watch Property Brothers, scratch, “What’s crackin’? Mmm.” Every time you scratch yourself, all you can think about is, “When can I smell my fingers? When can I smell my fingers? When can I discretely find a way to…” “…smell my fingers?” Nature made you urgently curious to protect you, ’cause you gotta check that it’s all good in the hood. If it’s too funky, you need to see a doctor. Your fingers are your first WebMD. When my husband and I were trying to have a kid, a lot of people were like, “Oh, my God, that’s so hot. You guys doin’ a lot of fuckin’?” No, dude. That’s– That’s shit you do in your 20s, OK? When in– When you’re in your 30s, and you’ve been trying to get pregnant for a while, it gets very clinical. You pee on these ovulation strips that tell you when the eggs are droppin’. It tells you when it’s Easter time. And I would only fuck him when it was Easter time. It was, like, only four days out of the month, and outside of that, I would be like, “We’re not fuckin’. I need you to save it. I want your sperm to be as pent-up, and as angry and rapey as possible. So that, when they come out, it’s like, ‘Release the Kraken!'” And they just come out like a bunch of angry refugees escaping a dictatorship, you know? And, um… yeah, and most of the time, like, we wouldn’t even have sex, ’cause I was so tired when I would come home, and see the smiley face on the ovulation strip, and I’d be like, “OK, it’s go time,” and I would just give my husband a hand job most of the time, and he would close his eyes immediately. I know what that means, OK? When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s not because they’re in such ecstasy with you that– that they need to close their eyes. When somebody closes their eyes during sex, it’s because they’re literally trying to shut the image\",\n",
       "  ' of your face out of their head and instead project two Latina lesbians that they saw earlier that day on RedTube onto the back of their eyelids. Which is fine by me, because then he doesn’t have to see the expression on my face that says, “Please, hurry the fuck up.” And then, when he was about to finish, I could always tell because the indication is very universal when a man is about to finish. It’s when they get that… that stupid-ass look on their face… …where they look like they just got bit by a zombie, just… And then, because we’re hippies, I’d be like, “Hey, hey! Please look me in the eye and remember to come with intention, OK?” And then, I would jump on him, and hold onto his neck, and I would just twerk, twerk, twerk the shit out of him… and do some of this shit that I learned in Atlanta. And then I would turn upside down immediately afterwards… to make sure all of that Harvard nectar would just drain inside of me. That’s right. ‘Cause I don’t wanna work anymore. I’m very grateful to be pregnant and to be… this far along, to be seven and a half months pregnant, because, last year, I had a miscarriage, which is very common. And a lot of women who are in their 20s flip out when they hear that. They’re like, “Oh, my God. That’s so dark and terrible. I can’t believe that.” I’m 33. Girl, when you’re 33, you’ll know plenty of women who have had a miscarriage. It’s super common, and I wish more women would talk about it so they wouldn’t feel so bad when they go through it. When I told my mom– She’s from a third world country, and when I told her I had one, she was like, “Uh, yeah. Where I’m from, that’s like losing a pair of shoes. It’s whatevs, OK?” And everything happens for a reason. I found out at my six-week sonogram, which is very early. And the doctor says to me, “Oh, my God, I see two sacks, which means you’re having twins.” And I was like, “No!” And then she said, “But what I don’t see is a heartbeat.” And I was like, “Yes!” “The Lord is mysterious!” Don’t feel bad, OK? They were the size of poppy seeds. I’ve picked boogers larger than the twins that I lost. And most women won’t let their husbands watch when they’re going through a miscarriage. I sat my husband down in front of me while I sat on the toilet, and I was like, “You look.” “You watch the whole thing.” And he felt so bad for me. And I used it as leverage and held that shit over his head for a month and got him to do whatever the fuck I wanted him to do for 30 days. He took me to see Beyoncé. He bought me a bike off of Craigslist. That’s my miscarriage bike, and I love it very much. For 30 days, I finally had the marriage I always wanted. I’m scared about giving childbirth, though. I’m– I’m very, very scared of childbirth. That’s why I’m going to hire a doula. You know what that is? You know what a doula is? That’s a white hippie witch… …that blows quinoa into your pussy to Keyser Söze all the pain away. A lot of women tried to freak me out. They tried to freak me out about childbirth by saying, “Ali, did you know that you’re gonna poop on the table?” I was like, “Yeah, I look forward to it.” I’m all backed up from holding in my shit at work. I can’t wait to cleanse. It makes sense, like, that you– that that happens because when you’re in labor, you push, you push, you push, and your husband will be asked to assist in the labor by lifting up your leg, which subsequently turns into a soft serve lever. You just shit on the floor in front of the love of your life. And just when you think that’s enough to make him finally leave you, boom, a baby comes out, and he gotta stay. That’s the real miracle of life, right there. I can already see how a child can really take its toll on a marriage, because the baby hasn’t even come out yet and I am already so resentful towards my husband. So much resentment, especially when he asks me to do shit around the house. “Hey, can you wash the dishes?” “No!” “Can you water the plants?” “I am not doing jack shit anymore. I’m busy makin’ a eyeball, OK? Are you makin’ a foot? I didn’t think so. You change the channel.” I can already see how there’s, like, this crazy double standard in our society of how it takes so little to be considered a great dad. And it also takes so little to be considered a shitty mom. People praise my husband for coming to all of my doctor’s appointments with me. “Oh, my God. I can’t believe he comes to all your doctor’s appointments. He is so supportive.” Guess who else has to go to those doctor appointments. Me! I’m the star of the show. There’s nothing for the camera to see if I’m not there. But he’s the hero for playing Candy Crush while I get my blood drawn. Meanwhile, if I do mushrooms seven months pregnant, I’m a bad mommy. You know, I– I– I, like, I berate my husband on, like, a daily basis. Partially because I really am mad at him. But mostly out of survival, because if he leaves me, I’m fucked. So, I have to chip away at his self-esteem on a daily basis… to keep him down so that he doesn’t believe that he’s worthy of another woman’s affection and leaves me. I gotta keep him around by keeping him down. People don’t tell you about all this shit that goes down with your body when you get pregnant, you know? Your nipples get huge and dark. I didn’t know that. I didn’t know that they get dark so that the baby can see, like, a bullseye. So that the baby can find it easier. And then, you know, they get big– they get big, like fingers. Like, “You, you. You owe me money, you.” My nipples look like Whoppers now, and naked, I look like a Minion. But I’m not gonna be one of those crazy pregnant ladies who tries to get all back in shape right after they get pregnant. No. Hopefully, if you see me in a year, I will have the kind of body where, if I do a nude scene on television, people will commend me for being courageous. For doing it. Now that I’m seven and a half months pregnant, my pussy’s all wet again. But it’s different. It’s not like when I was 18 years old, when it was like, really hot, you know? And I was like, “Why is it different?” And I looked it up, and my pussy’s all wet again because my– my body’s secreting mucus to protect the baby from bacteria attacking it. That’s not the same. When it’s straight up soldier glue, when it’s Neosporin. So, you know, I– I, in– previously, before I met my husband, I had dated a bunch of losers. And then, I meet this dream guy, who’s, like, way more handsome than me, out of my league, graduated from Harvard Business School. Worked hard to trap his ass. Got him to propose to me. Oh, my God, then we got married, all my dreams coming true, and then we got pregnant, and recently we bought our first home together. And, uh, two weeks into the escrow process, I discovered that my beautiful, Harvard-educated husband was $70,000 in debt. And me, with my hard-earned TV money, paid it all off. So, as it turns out, he’s the one who trapped me. How did he do it? How did he bamboozle me? Oh! Maybe because he went to Harvard Business School, the epicenter of white-collar crime. He Enron’d my ass. And now, if I don’t work, we die. Why else do you think I’m performing seven and a half months pregnant? All right, I’ve been Ali Wong. Have a good night, everybody. Thank you.

       " ['Yes! Thank you so much, Chicago. Thank you. I used to do something\\xa0a lot of comics do. I would blame my disgusting behavior on the city I was in. You know how people would be like, “Chicago, you got me so fucked up last night!” You know? And the crowd was like, “Okay. We were not here last night.” “Denver! You made me fuck that stranger, no condom. You’re crazy, Denver!” “Armed robbery? Philly, you silly.” “No, ma’am. We are concerned for you.” That’s all over now. Because I’m fucking pregnant! Yeah, I did it. I’m amazing. I laid there, and… that’s it. Usually, when someone in the public eye gets pregnant, there’s, like, a couple of months where there’s some rumors about them, you know? There’s some, like, “Oop, bump alert!” Right? Uh-oh. Uh… I was well into my second trimester. Not one fucking rumor about me. Nothing. I was photographed. Belly out. They’re like, “There’s Amy!” “Looking happy. I don’t know. Doing her.” And then so once people knew, they were like, “Is she showing?” They were like, “No more than normal. Kinda… It just kinda looks like she took her Spanx off.” There are all these rules about pregnancy that are unsaid. Where is it written that when you’re\\xa0pregnant, you have\\xa0to cup your little bump in every picture? It’s so obnoxious, guys. Every picture. Here… It’s all right. Some people do the two hand. I was like, okay, fuck it. I’ll do it, but I’m going to do it for the rest of my life. I’m going to be 90 years old like this, with a cigarette\\xa0in my mouth like… I do it. I cup the bump… in pictures, but I just do it a little bit lower. I just go right here. ‘Cause this is the area that got me in trouble in the first place. All the questions everyone… “What are\\xa0you having? Do you know what you’re having?” Hemorrhoids. Any other questions? Why do they ask, “What are you craving? What are you craving? Are you craving anything?” Cock! Just me and my angel. People always want to see the bump. That’s like the thing. “Just show me that\\xa0fucking bump, bitch.” And my belly button is getting so misshapen with this baby inside that I\\xa0had to put two Band-Aids over my belly\\xa0button tonight. That’s more than you bargained for, right? Somebody’s neglecting their bikini area. I… I’ll tell you who it’s not fun to be pregnant at the exact same time as. Meghan Markle. I think we’re, like, to the day the same amount pregnant. And she’s out there in, like, six-inch heels, adorable outfits, and she has like… There’s been no bump. Like, there’s been… She, like, cups where the bump will be, you know.\\xa0She’s like… “Here. Here’s where the baby will be.” People see me, they’re like, “The last couple of weeks are the hardest, right? Are you crowning? I think I can see an ear. Is that an ear?” If I were Meghan Markle… and I am… ‘Cause she hangs out with the Queen now. Like, they hang out and have conversations. If I were Meghan, no matter what the Queen\\xa0asked me, and I can’t do a great\\xa0British accent, but, you know, if she said something like, “La, la, la. Oh! Pip-pip! Would you like a spot of lemon?” Like probably exactly that, she probably says. No matter what, if I were Meghan, I would\\xa0answer everything she asks with, “Yas, Queen! Yas.” I just came so close to shitting myself. You guys don’t… This special almost became a real\\xa0special. That would have… What would I have done? Kind of just kicked it, and… trusted that you guys would be cool. Is that what I would have done? I have not had an easy pregnancy. I have hyperemesis, which I’d never even\\xa0heard of. It’s extreme nausea and vomiting. If you’ve ever had food poisoning, it’s that. I’ve had that every day for five months. No, and people are like, “You’re so strong. Look\\xa0at you out there. You’re on the road.” I’m contractually obligated to be out here, guys. I’m not like, “I don’t care. The show must\\xa0go on.” I’m like, “I will be sued by Live Nation.” That’s why I’m here. But I feel pretty good tonight, to be honest with you, so… I didn’t throw up today. Uh… Yeah, but I didn’t know that being pregnant could be really hard. Like… I didn’t know that because you\\xa0bitches all lie about it. Women don’t tell you how hard it is. I should have Googled it. I should have Googled being pregnant. ‘Cause it’s been really awful. ‘Cause in movies, they don’t show you. There’s just a montage where the girl’s in her office and she’s typing, and then\\xa0she’s like… And she runs to the bathroom, she throws up once! And then in the next scene, she’s in overalls painting a barn. Like, “Yay!” ♪ I can’t wait to meet you ♪ You know? I throw up an exorcist amount every day. And I feel like, you know, if you had\\xa0a good pregnancy, if you’re someone who enjoyed being pregnant, I just hope\\xa0your car flips over. That’s… That’s what I wish for you. Your car kind of Chappaquiddicks into a\\xa0lake, and you just kinda… …slowly… drown. Is that fair to say? Because here’s the thing. You’re pregnant, but you don’t change. I hate women who start to act really just precious and like, “Yes, now I’m… I’m a saint, and I never… I never had sex in a bathroom on a train,” you know? We’ve all had sex in the bathroom on a\\xa0train. You don’t stop being you, you know. You don’t stop working or drinking. Like, you… You know? I’ve gotten in the habit of asking, uh, friends’ recommendations and advice about pregnancy until I get the answer I\\xa0want. You know what I mean? I asked my most responsible\\xa0friend, she’s a nurse. I was like, “So, wine… what do you think? Should I just have\\xa0some, or what\\xa0do you think? While I’m pregnant. Wine? Definitely have some, or what do you think?” And… And she was like, “You know what? Just skip\\xa0it. Just be safe, you know?” And\\xa0I was like, “Yes, that’s what I thought, but I wanted to hear you say it, so now I’ll tell other people not to drink ever while they’re pregnant. Thank you.” Huh! Good. That’s done with. And then… You know, and then I asked, like, a little more lenient of a friend. I’m like… “Hey, what are your thoughts on drinking wine while you’re pregnant?” She’s like, “A glass a week is fine. Like, that’s probably fine.” I’m like, “That’s better. That makes sense.\\xa0That’s good. You’re smart.” And then… Then you ask your kind of biggest dirtbag, deadbeat friend, you know? She’s like, “Once you start getting, like, fucked up, stop drinking.” I’m like… Mm-hmm! No, I haven’t even wanted… wine. That’s how I know this baby is not mine. This baby is a lie. No, it’s mine, and… I’m pretty sure the guy\\xa0who got me pregnant is my husband ’cause I got married, yay! ♪ To the luckiest boy in the world ♪ I married a chef because I’m a fucking\\xa0genius. Right? Do you guys like food? That’s what he makes. Yeah. I love it. Marrying a chef, it’s like a little on-the-nose for me. It’s kind of like Snoop marrying weed. I love him. It’s real. Um… The proposal was wack. Uh… He proposed to me in the morning. That’s, like, when people in a nursing home\\xa0get engaged. Like… Not, like, at sunrise. I was still asleep. I was sleeping, a',\n",
       "  'nd I sleep like I’m still\\xa0in the womb. Earplugs, eye mask… my mom’s legs around my shoulders. Like… You know? Recreate. Every morning, I’m born and… So I’m… in the womb, and he comes in, and I just took one ear plug out. I was like… And he kind of threw the ring box\\xa0at me, and he goes, “I got you this.” And I open it, and… And he goes, “Do you want me to get down on one\\xa0knee?” and I was like, “I guess not.” And then I went back to sleep. That’s the truth.\\xa0That’s a real ass proposal, though. That’s like a real… You know? ‘Cause, like, in movies and TV shows, the guy\\xa0always gets down on one knee, right? And the girl’s always shocked. “I didn’t even know you liked me! I’m still on Bumble. Like, this is…” Like, you didn’t talk about… That’s a very\\xa0big decision… to not talk about. I don’t know any\\xa0girl who got engaged that way. I’m from New York. All my girlfriends are from New York. We get married late there. When you\\xa0get engaged at 40, it’s like, “Whoa, teen bride! Like, slow… Slow it down. Get to know him.” I think there are only two reasons you should get down on one knee if you’re a guy. If you’re a player in the NFL… and to eat my pussy. Those are the two… Two reasons. I mean, if the guy you’re with gets, like, synchronized swans to dance\\xa0to Bruno Mars, you\\xa0know? He’s gay. That’s a gay guy. And, look, we all have a friend married to a\\xa0gay guy. We do. We do.\\xa0You’re probably here with a couple right now. And they’re like, “Talk about Meghan Markle more.” We’ve had that experience, right? When you meet the couple for the first time, and then they leave, and then a couple of your friends, you’re taking each other’s\\xa0temperature. You’re like… “Jeff was nice, right?” “Yeah. Yeah. Jeff was cool, yeah.” “You said he’s a costume designer. He’s a… Yeah.” And then finally someone’s like, “Is Jeff gay?” You’re like, “Jeff is gay! Yes!” And we all laugh at our friend. “Hee-hee, she’s married to a gay guy.” But you know\\xa0what? Someone with hyperemesis who’s five months\\xa0pregnant, you know who sounds like it would be fun to be married to right now? Fucking Jeff. Get on one knee for Jeff. I think… I don’t want to jinx it. I think I don’t have to be a bridesmaid anymore. Yeah, I think I’ve done… I’m not making no new friends. Everybody got married. I was the last one. ‘Cause when you get in your late\\xa030s, there’s just no dignity to it,\\xa0you know? It’s like me in a Grecian gown with my aging cleavage and like… a Coachella flower halo. I’m just like… Just hoping I’m not the bridesmaid with the biggest arm, you know? I’m like… I hold my arm out. ‘Cause people used to get married in their early 20s. You had a little 20-year-old bridesmaid\\xa0arm. You were\\xa0holding your champagne\\xa0like, “It’s heavy!” Now it’s just a sea of turkey legs, just… Looks like the defensive line for the Bears are in the wedding. I really respect you guys for coming out because if you follow me on Instagram, you’re probably like, “Is this bitch in the\\xa0hospital? Is she gonna be there?” Yeah. I made it. I… I’ve been hospitalized a couple of times since I’ve been pregnant with hyperemesis and… The very first time was about a month ago,\\xa0and… I was throwing up for about five hours when I… was taken to the hospital. The doctor came in, and he explained to me and my sister and my husband, who were are all\\xa0in the room. He said, “You’re going to be here for at least five\\xa0hours getting liquids.” And without\\xa0skipping a beat, my husband\\xa0said to my sister, “Okay, cool, because I saw a place where you\\xa0can paint pottery nearby.” You guys are like, “Is he gay?” So my sister didn’t even,\\xa0like, check in with me if it was cool that they left me. As soon\\xa0as he said “pottery,” they just left. And I was like, “I’ll be here.” And about an hour and a half later, my sister rushed back in the room, and she\\xa0said, “Okay, listen. Be nice to him about\\xa0what he painted.” I’m like… “Okay.” She’s like, “I’m serious. He worked really hard on it.” “Okay.” She goes… “And it’s not very flattering.” I’m like, “What?” But my husband’s brain is a little different. ‘Cause you go to these places, you usually\\xa0paint a teddy bear or a jewelry box, you\\xa0know, but my husband decided to… to paint a plate… which he would use as a canvas… to paint me. And I’m going to show you the picture. I think it’s important for you guys\\xa0to see the picture. Um… And I want to show you this, and I\\xa0want you to know that there were no qualifiers before he showed me this picture. He was sure it was pretty good. This is the picture that he painted. I was in the hospital, guys. What is… I wanted to go, “What’s with my chin on my\\xa0neck?” I look like Trump. Like, I look… I couldn’t say any of this to him, okay? Get rid of it. People are leaving. This is upsetting. This is an upsetting image. I mean… I had to comfort him. My husband is a really great sport. You know? He really is. I keep messing\\xa0with him. Like, you know, I’ve had a tough pregnancy, so… the other day, I was like, “Babe, this is kind of too hard for me. I don’t think I can do it.” And he’s like, “What do you mean?” And I was like… “What do you think I mean? I think I… I need to get an abortion.” And this was his response. He went… “Really?” I was like, “No! What?” I’m going to announce it on Instagram, and then I’m going to be like, “Actually, forget it. I don’t like it. I’m tired. I don’t like it.” Thank God that was his response, you know? What if he’d been like, “Cool. I’ll warm up\\xa0the car.” I knew from the beginning that my husband’s brain was a little different\\xa0than mine. Um, and about… I have to start this over ’cause I really want to get this right. Because I love him very much. And… My husband was diagnosed with what used to be called Asperger’s. He has autism\\xa0spectrum disorder. He’s on the spectrum. And… there were some signs early on, like… we went for a walk about a year ago, and I fell. And kinda nine out of ten people would go, “Oh, my God! Are you okay?” Right? Maybe more like ten out of ten people. “Oh, my God! Are you okay?” But instead, my husband went… He kind of froze and became a lighthouse, opening and closing his mouth, just… And I remember lying on the ground looking up at him, and I wasn’t mad. I just thought, “Huh!” A lot of “huh” moments, you know? And once he was diagnosed, it dawned on me how funny it was because all of the characteristics that make it\\xa0clear that he’s on the spectrum are all\\xa0of the reasons that I fell madly in love\\xa0with him. That’s the truth. He says whatever is on his mind. He keeps it so real, you know? He doesn’t\\xa0care about social norms or what you\\xa0expect him to say or do. You know, if I say to him, like, “Does this look like shit?” He’ll go, “Yeah. You have a lot of other clothes. Why don’t you wear those?” I’m like… “Okay.” But he can also make me feel more beautiful than anyone ever has\\xa0my whole\\xa0life. Yeah, it’s true. And he can’t lie. Is that the dream man, a guy who can’t lie? But that also means that he can’t lie for\\xa0me. Which ',\n",
       "  \"is an essential part of any relationship. We’re friends with this couple, and they broke up, and the guy started dating a new girl pretty soon after, and we happened to be at\\xa0the party where they got together, so I didn’t rush to tell the\\xa0ex-girlfriend what happened. So a couple of months later, we had dinner with her, and she was like, “And, you know, at\\xa0that party, that’s when they got together.” And I was like… “No! It’s not possible.” And Chris goes… “No, you remember.” “No. No, I don’t.” “Yeah, remember? ‘Cause you said, ‘Oh, my God, he’s\\xa0leaving with her.'” “Thank you, Chris! Thank you. I guess I forgot about that.” Also, one of the the signs of autism is you don’t make sort of the… appropriate facial expression for the\\xa0occasion you’re at. So we were gonna go on a red carpet together for the first time, and we were practicing his\\xa0smiles, you know, and we didn’t land on one that we were in love with. So we were out of time, so I said, “Just… This is what I do.\\xa0Just think about something you love,\\xa0you know?” And he loves the ocean, so… So we went out there and it worked, but it worked too well. ‘Cause in all the pictures, I’m doing my normal bullshit, and he\\xa0was like… I noticed. I was like, “A pond. Just like\\xa0you’re glancing at a pond. Pull it back.” It’s exciting being pregnant. It’s not all bad. The best part about it is not getting your period. Yeah. That’s the silver uterine lining, if you want to look for one. That’s nice because,\\xa0you know, what I realized, right before I got pregnant, I\\xa0noticed… how ashamed… we’ve all been made to feel about getting\\xa0our period… our whole lives. Like we choose it, you\\xa0know? Like, “Can’t kick my bleeding habit, you know? I just want it. I want to do it.” It’s supposed to be, you know, a secret. The second you get it, your mom goes, “You’re a woman now. And that’s disgusting. Never let anyone know of your filthy secret.” And you’re like, “Okay. I’m 12. I’m ready to handle this.” This is my Rainbow Brite lunch box. ♪ Rainbow Brite Stars are shining bright ♪ And it is. That’s the most embarrassing\\xa0thing that could possibly happen to you as a kid, that someone knows you have your period, or they see you have your period. At that age, for men, the most\\xa0embarrassing thing is unwanted erections,\\xa0right? But then they grow up and show them to\\xa0everyone. Maybe that’s what we should do. I don’t know. Call a coworker into your office. “Carl… Psst. Come in here. Close the door.” “Carl, you’re getting very sleepy.” All this talk about dick pics, how about a tamp pic? You up? If you’re still in a position where you’re getting dick pics, ladies, I have a\\xa0suggestion for you. When you get a dick\\xa0pic… send back… a dick pic. You go, “Oh, I’m sorry. I thought we were exchanging our favorite\\xa0dick pics. Dick for dick, pic for pic, no? I thought…” Why are we made to feel so ashamed of a natural bodily function that ultimately brings life, you know? It’s like… If you\\xa0forget a tampon, you have to bum one from\\xa0somebody. What we all do is, first, you look around… like you’re going to say something racist, just like… And whatever race you thought I meant, that’s your problem. And… Then you kind of lean in, and we don’t even say the whole sentence. We kind of go… “Does anybody have a…” “Tampon?” What is this? What’s the claw? That’s how disgusted we are with ourselves. “Does anyone have a tampon?” And I notice myself do it. I was in a gym locker room. Thank you.\\xa0And… And there were a bunch of women in there, and I… And this woman across the locker room with so much confidence was like, “Oh, yeah, I do. What size?” And, like, obviously, I know there are different sizes of\\xa0tampons, but I’ve never been confronted… …with that question before, you know? She’s like, “Yeah, what’s the circumference of your pussy hole? Grande or venti? What are we plugging, bitch? I’ve got Pilates. What is it?” Then all the other women in the locker room kinda lean in to hear… …my answer, you know? I’m just like… “I don’t know. Do you have, like, a… super Grand Canyon? I don’t know. Just throw me a futon mattress. I’ll just kind of squat over it.” My vagina is going to get bigger, I heard. Whoo! Can’t wait. Take up more space. Lean in! It’s already grown. It just grows over the years. I know because, I mean, when I was younger, I could put a Tic Tac in\\xa0there and then just walk around all day. At night, I swear it would still be\\xa0in the same\\xa0place, just… Whoop! Now… if I have a yeast infection, which I do… and I try to put one of those Monistat\\xa0suppositories in, it just falls right on\\xa0the floor. Whoop! Be careful. They’re very slippery. I do. I have a yeast infection. I’m gonna address it ’cause I have to do the pinch. You guys know the pinch. Ladies, just a quick, little pinch. But I’m really excited about this. We don’t even need tampons anymore. There’s a new invention. – You guys know what I’m talking about? – DivaCup! No, not the DivaCup. That is terrifying. Um… The DivaCup… Do you know what it is? It’s like this little cup you store in the back of your vagina, and it collects… and at the end of the day, you pull\\xa0it out and you kinda Kill Bill. Just kind of… No! It’s a lot. It’s too much for me. I respect you if you can handle the DivaCup. Such a confident name. “I’m a Diva.” No. It’s more exciting than the DivaCup. It’s a new invention called THINX. Yes. Yeah, you don’t need a tampon. They’re just these underwear that you just bleed into. Which I guess… makes me a fucking inventor. Ah! Who knew? Should I go on Shark Tank? “Sharks…” Did anyone have a mom like me who didn’t\\xa0really trust tampons and made them only wear a\\xa0pad? Right? And millennials, if you don’t know what a pad is, congratulations, and… A pad is kind of a foot-long diaper that you… …coil betwixt your legs, and… just kinda waddle around all day wearing it, just… Crunch! Crunch! Kinda always sounds like there’s a killer right behind you. They were great. Yeah. Little adhesive wings. They’d always stick right to your pubes. It was a treat. It was a real treat. Sorry you missed it. I’m sorry. Millennials… pubes… Anybody remember pubes? I miss my mom’s bush. Did you guys see your mom’s bush growing up? It’s kind of comforting, right? The first time you see it, I’ll never forget. I remember I walked in the bathroom to say\\xa0goodnight. I was like, “Mom! Oh. Hi, Mom. Good night.” I remember Mom’s bush. I also had one of those moms… who told me, “You only have to shave\\xa0up to\\xa0your knee.” Right? “Just shave up to your knee.” I’d say, “Mom, I’m pretty hairy up…” “No! The knee.” “Okay.” I’d be at the community pool. People are like… “Why is Amy wearing wool shorts?” But I have to give it up for my mom. She made me so confident. She just straight lied to me as a kid. It’s tough to say “confident”… as a woman, you know? You put on TV. We see all these gorgeous women. We have to compete with what’s her face, the Mother of Dragons. What’s her name? – Khaleesi! – Kris Jenner. It’s \",\n",
       "  'just… It’s tough. It’s tough out there. No, I love the Kardashians. The Kardashians are so confident, they confuse me about my own confidence. So before I was pregnant, I was kind of like feeling myself one day, and I bought lingerie. Like… the real shit. Like… the, you know, fishnets, and then… like the pulley system\\xa0here. You know? Thought they would’ve updated that technology, but it’s still a pulley system, and then, you\\xa0know, the boost… Whatever it’s called. And… You know, I went. I paid for it. I tried it on at home, you know, where I\\xa0could take my own life, and… In the safety of home, and… I tried it on, and I was kind of ready to blow my own mind. I kind of sidled up to the mirror, and I\\xa0check myself out, and I was like, “Oh. This isn’t for everybody. Hmm. Okay.” I looked like I should have been on Law & Order, like, “He went that way.” My fishnets looked like they’d caught an actual fish. It was… It was pretty confusing. It’s tough to say “confident” as a girl. I don’t know what I’m having. I hope it’s a girl. Um… But really just because it’s such a scary\\xa0time for men. Such a scary time. Men, thank you so much for leaving your houses\\xa0tonight. I just… God. First responders,\\xa0just… so brave. I don’t know if men know how scared we are as women all the time. Like, one in three of us will be assaulted at some point in our lives. If you’re a woman of color, it’s even more than that. If you’re a trans woman, forget it. At night in New York, if I take the subway\\xa0at night, I will run home. Women, we run home. Not for the cardio. It’s true. When you walk to your\\xa0car in a dark parking lot, what do you ladies do? We do the little\\xa0makeshift brass\\xa0knuckle with our key, right? I don’t know what our plan is with that key in our knuckle. “Oh, no, you don’t! Ahh! Not on my watch. Boop-boop!” I mean… There was a study done, and it said that women mostly fear violence. That’s our number one fear. And the same study showed that men’s\\xa0number one fear… was ridicule. Oh… Yeah, God! I’m so sorry. I didn’t know you guys were going\\xa0through that. It must be so hard for you. Do you guys run home? Because you’re afraid of somebody telling a\\xa0little jokey about you? I think that we need to start from scratch, you know? I’m so grateful to this new generation of women that came along and\\xa0they’re like, “Hey, have you been getting\\xa0sexually harassed like this your whole\\xa0lives?” And we’re like, “Oh, yeah!” And they’re like, “Yeah. You wanna do something about that?” And we’re like, “Oh, yeah. That’s a very good idea.” They’re like, “Yeah.” And we’re like, “Oh.” We’re so used to it, you know? You’re at work, and you’re like, “I have to make every guy think that we also might fuck and do a good\\xa0job.” It’s not fair. It’s not fair to men either. You guys are raised with so much pressure to be so masculine at such a young age. It’s bullshit. It sucks. It’s like a six-year-old kid crying. “Stop crying, you little pussy.” We toughen them up at a young age so they\\xa0don’t get made fun of, and then, as little\\xa0girls, you’re in school with these boys, and when a little boy is mean to you or he teases you, what does everybody say? – He likes you. – “He likes you.” Ooh! You’re like, “He knocked my books out of my hands.” “Whoo! Looks like somebody has a little boyfriend at\\xa0school. That’s a good thing.” And you’re like, “Oh. That’s a good thing! Okay! I’m the luckiest girl in school.” “He pushed me down the stairs.” “You’re going\\xa0to prom!” “Prom!” Right? Then we grow up and we all have\\xa0friends who were like, “Why do I only date\\xa0assholes?” ‘Cause you’ve been trained to do that since you were a toddler. You know, we have friends who are like, “You should see us when we’re alone. He’s still really mean to me, but it’s not as embarrassing.” It doesn’t occur to us to be with someone\\xa0who’s kind until we’re, like, almost dead, you know? I mean, who cares?\\xa0We’re about to lose our rights, anyway. Right, ladies? Take ’em. I’m sick of it. Give me my bonnet. Give me my cape. I’m ready. Done washing my hair all the\\xa0time. I mean, look at us making decisions about our own bodies. Who do we think we are? Men? Come on! Decisions are hard. Rights feel heavy. I want people who know better than anyone making the decisions about my body. I want to call up Mitch McConnell and be\\xa0like, “Girl! My discharge is brown, baby girl. What should I do? Mitch! Chuck Grassley, I’ve got cramps. Am I ovulating, queen? Lindsey mammo-Graham, feel this. What you think? You guys know.” Maybe some of you heard I got arrested in\\xa0October. Thank you. Thank you. God’s work. Um… I went down to DC to get arrested. The different news outlets wrote about it. Like, “Schumer’s been detained,” like I was just on a walking tour of the\\xa0Washington Monument. But I went down there to oppose Brett Kavanaugh’s confirmation. Thank you, sisters. Men, you can clap too. Spoiler alert. It didn’t go our way. The whole way down, I was really nervous about getting\\xa0arrested. I’ve been arrested before, obviously, but… But I was obsessed with the fear of being\\xa0hungry. You know, while I was locked up. So… It probably would have been like that before I was pregnant, but that just\\xa0doubled it, so the whole way down… And, you know, we get down there, and… it was\\xa0really intense and really emotional, and… We were gonna get arrested on the Capitol steps, but they barricaded those, so we all rush into the Hart Building, where the senators’ offices are, and we all flood in this hallway, and, you know, the banners are flying and the\\xa0Capitol police are closing in, and we know we’re about to be arrested, and everyone’s chanting, “No justice, no peace,” and, “We believe survivors. We believe survivors.” And I know we’re about to be arrested, so I am… ramming snacks in my mouth. I am… Everyone’s, “We Believe,” and I’m… And the Capitol police are looking at me like, “What the fuck?” I’m like… Just Cookie Monster, crumbling shit on my face. I got arrested with my friend, Emily Ratajkowski, who’s a supermodel, like gorgeous, you know. And she’s in this hot outfit,\\xa0and she’s like, “We believe\\xa0survivors,” and I’m in a Department of Sanitation shirt, and I’m like… “Ahh!” And some people criticized me. They were\\xa0like, “That was irresponsible. You’re pregnant.” And I was like, “That’s why I went down there.” I want to be able to tell this\\xa0kid I did everything I could. You know? And D.C., I heard, has the best cocaine, so… My friend said it’s fine. Uh… A baby. Guys, what the fuck am I doing? We have no idea what we’re doing. We have some books at home, and every week, there’s a terrifying video saying what’s\\xa0going on in the baby’s\\xa0development. “This week, your baby is growing fur and eating you from the inside.” I’m glad I found a good partner,\\xa0you know? Like, he’s solid as hell. Yeah. I just… I didn’t have the energy for dating anymore, like… Remember when you hook up with someone the first time? Do you remember you used to undress each other? Know wha',\n",
       "  't I’m talking about? They do that in movies. So you’re like… It’s always hard. In movies… But you’re\\xa0like, okay, a braided belt, and there is\\xa0the silver thing. And then, oh, a button fly. I’ll just kind of yank it. And your sock. Am I in fucking retail? Take your own shit\\xa0off. My back hurts. I was in bed with my husband the other night. I was holding our dog, and my husband just took off my underwear. And I looked over at him and I was like, “Oh, no.” That’s crazy, you know. He was kind of like, “Okay.” Like he didn’t give a shit too much, you\\xa0know. And we’re lying there, and I’m like… “Can you put my underwear back on?” Such sad foreshadowing watching him, like, dress my lifeless body. We were at the gynecologist a couple months ago, and I asked, “Is it safe to have sex while pregnant?” And she was like, “Yes, it is safe to have sex through the\\xa0whole pregnancy.” And I was like, “We’ll be seeking a second opinion.” That’s fucking… I was trying to signal her, you know. “Hey. Do you think it’s safe… for us to have sex? Do you think it would probably kill the baby\\xa0and we shouldn’t do it?” She’s like, “No, it’s safe the whole time.” I was like, “Okay. Okay.” Do you want me to come to your house to tell your husband he can fuck you? ‘Cause people tell you. You’re like, wow, that was fast. “Last time we saw you, you were single,\\xa0Amy, and you already don’t want to fuck your husband?” I usually do, but I have hyperemesis. And you know everyone says, “When you get married, get ready to stop having sex.” And we were like, “Not us. We’re fucking for life,” you know. Now he, like, touches my shoulder on the\\xa0couch, and I’m like, “Can I help you? I’m over here. You’re over there.” The spontaneity is over. Thank God. You know, when you’re first falling in love, like you might always\\xa0have sex. Every time you pee, you’ve gotta make sure you clean the toilet paper out of your\\xa0pussy. Every time you pee. Every time. That is over. I have, like, half a roll\\xa0of Charmin in there\\xa0right now. Yeah. I’m psyched to be done. I am. Especially dating someone new, you know. And I’m glad I married someone, he’s my age. We’re the same age, so… You know, we both grew up without Internet porn. That’s a huge deal, right? Like, you know, now I feel like you can’t fuck a millennial without them being like, “Can you dress like an emoji?” You’re like, “No!” What the fuck? No. And there’s so many different types\\xa0of porn. It’s crazy. One of the biggest searches is “gag porn.” Have you heard of that? That’s where the girl gags on the guy’s\\xa0penis because it’s too darn big. I personally never had the plesh. I just wanted to remind you that\\xa0I’ve never struggled with it, even though… You remember the size of my mouth, right? Do you remember how big my mouth is? Just like a tiny bow. You could put… Okay, yeah. You remember. Gag porn. Like that one… That one is strange to me. Like you’re\\xa0clicking on all these\\xa0different windows. Nothing, nothing. And then a girl’s like… And you’re like, “Mmm, wait a minute. What have we here?” Maximize screen. “Okay. Okay.” If you’re into gag porn, you should’ve\\xa0been living at my house the last five months. You’d be hard as a\\xa0rock. Something else I won’t miss, and this is my PSA… to men. A lot of men don’t really understand how to put themselves inside you. Not really. Even missionary. They’re… You know, they’re… It’s the wrong hole,\\xa0or not a hole. You’re like, “You have to use an existing hole, sir.” You’re not going to confuse my body into making\\xa0a new hole. But most guys can figure it out, but you\\xa0really realize that they don’t understand where our hole goes when they’re behind\\xa0you, right? ‘Cause during some sex, it’s always I don’t know whose suggestion to not\\xa0look at your face anymore. “How about you turn around?” “Oh, okay.” You look back over the shoulder, they’re like, “Nope!” You’re like, “Okay. I’ll be here.” That’s when you know because there’s a whole population of men who, once they get\\xa0back there behind you, they’ll kneel back there and just wait. Dick in the wind. And you’re up here, like… “Uh… We’re rolling.” And you realize that he’s waiting for you… who’s on all fours… …to reach back… and put him inside you. You’re like, “Oh, you want me to…? Oh, Okay. Uh… Yeah. I’ll just use my head as, like, a kickstand, just… Yeah. No, it makes sense. I have the\\xa0better angle here. You want to back the garage up to the car, is what…?” Okay. Nope, it’s fine. You’ve had a long day making more money than\\xa0me. Here I come.” Luckily, my husband does not have that problem. Because… of that joke. I know I talk so much shit about, uh, my pregnancy, and it has not been easy, but we’re so fucking excited, and I do\\xa0feel really lucky that I was able to get\\xa0pregnant. Yeah. So I… was single, you know, most of my life, and felt pretty happy. I love my family and friends, and I feel really satisfied with work, and… kind of had accepted that, you know? And then I just happened… to meet this guy, and if you’re out there\\xa0and you’re dating and you’re just thinking, “Why can’t I meet the right one?” It’s\\xa0not that you haven’t met the right one yet. I wish someone had told me this. It’s not\\xa0that you haven’t\\xa0met the right one yet. It’s just… that you have to wait… for them to get tired. No one told me, right? Because men in their\\xa020s and their 30s are just running\\xa0around. And then their late 30s, they’re like, “Oh, God! Phew. Oh, God!” And that’s when you come along and you\\xa0go… “Come on.” And they’re like, “Where are we going?” And you’re like… “We’re going to sit on the couch and watch\\xa0Bravo till we die.” Thank you so much, Chicago. I love you. I realized how ashamed I was of my period. Excuse me. The baby. Right now, every fart’s a gamble. Fart roulette. My money’s on brown. Um… So they’re flashing a light that says that I\\xa0need to get some makeup because I’m\\xa0sweating like a monster. All right. You guys can only see that I’m sweating here, but if there was a camera in my asshole… This is all my hair I bought. There are these two people right in the front row here. I’m not going to look at them, but these two people. And like… They’re, like, truly horrified by everything I’m saying. I’m like, “Did you guys think you were seeing Godspell?” Okay. I promise it’s not going to get any better,\\xa0you guys. Your email address will not be published.

       " ['Hey, it’s Andrew Santino, and here I am in my hometown, Chicago, Illinois, where I’m shooting my stand-up comedy special, but before I do, I want to take you around my city, and I want to show you the gems that people don’t talk about, locals-only type of stuff. Hey, excuse me. Can I get a ride? No. Okay. Fair enough. Chicago. Well, I have a meeting, and I don’t know you. It’s fine. I get that. Why should I even… You know, that’s an odd question to ask. You’re right. Now that I think about it… In the city here, with all the crime and everything, – just hop in and get a ride? You’re right. Best city in the world, baby… Chicago. Boom, a local spot… Willis Tower, on the corner, of course, of Jackson and Wacker. Now, Jackson and Wacker is famous ’cause of Andrew Jackson and because people used to get whacked. Right below me, the Chicago Pond, a beautiful piece of water. People swim in here. Olympics train in this thing. Jordan actually was inside the mold when they molded him. They cracked it, pulled him out, reassembled it. Boom. Here we are at The Wiener’s Circle, bro… The best hot dog in Chicago. And they treat me like I’m from here. Come on in. Hey, let me get a hot dog, ladies. How do you want it? You know how I want it, man. What, up your ass or down your fucking throat? Come on, order correctly, pussy lips. Let’s get it together. Before I continue this tour, I’m gonna get a drink. Ah, double fisting. Chi Town is a drinking city. Everybody knows that. Ah, beers for the crew, beers for the crew, beers for the crew. Cheers, you guys. Cheers. Okay, we had more planned. We’re never gonna get to it. You want to know more about Chicago, Google it, okay? Enjoy the special. Cheers. Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to introduce you to my grandson… Andrew Santino. We did it. We did it. Yes. Chicago, Illinois, my hometown, how are you? Yes. Crazy. That’s my grandmother, man. Yeah, that’s the best thing in the world. My grandmother brought me up. Give it up for Mary Garrity, man. Cheers. Cheers to you guys. Cheers. My grandfather, who passed away, used to say… A waitress would bring him water, and he would say, ‘What is that?’ And she’d say, ‘It’s water.’ And he said, ‘I’m thirsty, not dirty, so get me a drink.’ So cheers to my grandpa. Here we are, Chi Town. We did it. We came a long way. We’re here. I’m so happy to be back in this city. I’m back home. It’s amazing. I’m feeling the vibe again. You know what I mean? I took a walk around the lake. I was listening to conversations, two guys arguing, yelling at each other with that thick Chicago accent. You know, that… Ah, Chicago. It’s Chicago. ‘A’ s are ahs. Chi-cah-go. And Ts are Ds. Over dere in Chi-cah-go. You know that? ‘A’s, ahs, T, Ds, everyone’s racist. It’s such a good city. What a city. I heard two men fighting. Two men were in an argument, in just a verbal argument, not anything bigger than that, just arguing, and the one guy goes, ‘You know what? Why don’t you suck my dick?’ And the other guy goes, ‘Pfft! You suck my dick.’ And I was like, ‘Hey, suck each other’s dicks, man.’ That would’ve been a fight to see, huh? Comes up like, ‘You motherfucker.’ Finish him. Finish him. We got to stop saying it like that. Guys have to stop saying it like that ’cause girls are gonna start believing it. It has a negative connotation when you say that. You go, ‘Suck my dick.’ We say it negative. Suck my dick. You say it like it’s a bad thing. It’s the best thing in the world. It’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. We should say it nice. You should go, ‘Hey! ‘Suck my dick, please, if you have time. ‘If you don’t, it’s not a big deal. I would love it a lot.’ I’m proud of being from this town. I love this town. I miss it a lot. It’s where my family is from. My family’s still here. It’s great to come home, see my parents. They’re getting older, which is weird. That’s a hard thing, to see your parents get older… Like, honest older, You know when your parents just say shit that when you were a kid, you were like, ‘Oh, you never used to say shit like that when I was a kid.’ Like, my mom was like, ‘Well, I’m gonna leave the house. What are you gonna do for the weekend?’ And my dad was watching TV, and he turns, and he goes, ‘Eat steak, watch porn.’ I applaud the honesty out of that guy, really sharp. I appreciate that. Tell her the truth, man. They’re getting older. You know what I mean? They get older, but I love that about these people. They’re fantastic. They raised me. I mean, did they raise me correctly? I don’t know. Maybe not. I grew up here in downtown Chicago for half of my life in Chicago. In the second half, we moved to the western suburbs, right? We moved to the suburbs ’cause my sister was born, and my parents were like, ‘I’ m not gonna fuck up two of them. ‘We can’t do that. One’s good. We’ll fuck up one. That’s okay.’ We moved to the western suburbs, you know, to try to better the life of all of us, but, like, I still realize sometimes how, like, my mom used to fuck with us subtly. Like, my mom is crazy. She’s a crazy person in the best way, but she would, like, lay it in real slow. Like, my parents were somewhat religious, right? You know, I mean, Irish Catholic kind of. You know what I mean? Like, somewhat in, you know what I mean? They’re, like, in the hot tub maybe. But she used to do this thing. She used to make me say, every single night before I went to bed, ‘Now I lay me down to sleep.’ Do you know that? Does anybody know that? I used to have to say this. I used to have to repeat this. I ‘d say,’ Now I lay me down to sleep. ‘I pray the Lord my soul to keep, ‘and if I die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take.’ I would say that before bed, which is a really fucked-up thing… for a child to say out loud. If I die before I wake up? I’m six. I’m gonna die in the middle of the night, and God’s gonna leave my body, take my soul, but be like, ‘Body’ s good. Leave the body. It’s fine. Leave it.’ What’s going on? Crazy person. I love her. She’s the best in the world. I had Irish Catholic guilt. I had so much Irish Catholic guilt when I was a kid, I used to flip a coin to determine whether or not I was gonna masturbate that day. You think I’m kidding? I would take a quarter. I would go, ‘Heads, yes, tails, no.’ I’d flip it, I’d get tails, and I’d go, ‘Ah, best two out of three. We got to go again. Let ‘s see what happens.’ He didn’t beat me, never won. That’s how heavy my guilt was. Seriously, that’s how, like, in my head I was about that God-is-watching-you type of stuff. Like, my mother used to let us not lock the doors. She was against it. She was like, ‘You don’ t lock the doors inside of the house. ‘If you’ re locking the doors inside of the house, it means you’re doing something you shouldn’t be doing.’ Yeah, that’s why we lock the doors. Don’t come in here. I’m pulling on my body. Get out of here. Leave me alone, lady. That’s how I realized the guy that invented locks inside of a house must’ve been caught masturbating by his wife one too many times. He was sick of it. He was sick of it. He’s like, ‘You know what? That’s it. I’m gonna put locks inside the house.’ She ‘s like,’ Michael, what are you doing? ‘We have locks on the outside of the house ‘to keep criminals from coming inside. There’s no criminals inside of this house.’ Yes, there are, Karen, and they’re robbing me of my freedom. Let me pull on my body in peace. Leave me alone, Karen. Anyway, I love being from this city, and now I live in Los Angeles, California. I live on the other side of this great country. I like it out there. It’s okay. It’s a second home for me. It takes some getting used to. It’s a little bit difficult, but the big difference is, like, when I come back home, you know, like, all my mom wants to do is talk about, like, the weather. Like, that’s a big thing. My mom is like, ‘How is the weather in California? Is it nice like this?’ It’s like, ‘Yeah, it’s better than this. That’s why I’m out there. What are you talking about?’ It’s always better. It’s always better. It is. There’s a lot of stuff that isn’t better, but the weather’s always gonna be better, and she loves bringing up the ‘feels like’ meter. You know what that is? The news guy. The news guy’s like, ‘It’s 62. Feels like 68.’ That’s Midwest hope. That’s hope circulating in your body. It’s the greatest lie ever told. Who’s the ‘feels like’ guy? I want that job. If that’s a job, I want it tonight. I’ll drop this bullshit gig and go do that tonight. The ‘feels like’ guy… Greatest gig ever. Here in the studio, it’s 62 on the barometer. We’re gonna go live to Andrew Santino. Andrew, what does it feel like? How’s it going, news team? Like 67. Right back to you guys. Back to you guys, man. It’s nice, really nice out. It’s crazy, man, ’cause the weather here fluctuates so much. Like, when I come back, you’re never surprised. Like, you’re never surprised by anything in Chicago, but, like, who I feel bad for when I come back is the homeless people. I always feel bad for homeless here, man. Like, I don’t feel bad for homeless people in L.A. People can get mad at me for saying that. I don’t give a shit. They’re awful human beings, these L.A. homeless people. They’re terrible. They’re terrible people. I feel bad for Chicago homeless, right? Because they die in the winter, and they die in the summer. They’re never not dying. They’re always dying. There’s, like, a week when it’s like, ‘We might make it,’ and that’s it, and they bucket-drum their way through that week. Soldiers, man. So I feel bad for homeless people in Chicago, from my heart, ’cause this is my home. So, when I come home, I give money. I gave money today to a homeless guy. I’m not lying. I gave money to a homeless guy ’cause I feel bad for him. I know what he’s got to go through. I gave that money to that guy, right? And I’ll always do that, but I also want to look him in the eye and go, ‘Hey, start walking south. You have nothing to do tomorrow. What are you doing here? You have something on your calendar? You don ‘t have a calendar.’ You can air-fistfight dragons all over this great country. I’m sure there’s half-smoked cigarettes strewn across this great land. I mean, the wind is their therapist. That’s all over the place. They can move about, man. You know the birds? You know those things? You know those guys? When they leave, follow those guys. Birds are born instinctively knowing, when it gets cold, to be like, ‘Oh, let’ s get the fuck out of here. ‘It’ s cold. Let’s leave. This is ridiculous. Why are we here? This is ridiculous.’ But I don’t feel bad for homeless people in Los Angeles at all… I really don’t. I don’t. I don’t feel bad for them. Some people are like, ‘Oh, that’s kind of mean.’ I don’t give a shit. I don’t give a shit, ’cause I live amongst these people, and they’re rude. They’re rude. You know why they’re rude? ‘Cause they made it. They’re at the promised land. It’s 72 degrees outside. You know what it is inside my place? Seventy-two. Who pays for that? I do. Fuck those guys. They won the lottery. They sleep on the beach. I came out of a restaurant, right? I came out of a restaurant. When I first moved there, I had no money. I had zero money. Came out of a restaurant, had some leftovers, went up to a homeless guy, said, ‘Hey, sir, I got some leftovers. Would you like this?’ Okay? I’m on a date, in front of a lady. Would you like this, sir? And the homeless guy looks up at me, and he says, ‘What’s in it?’ And I looked at him, and I said, ‘Tomorrow.’ Another day on this earth. What are you, gluten-free? Eat the food. You’re cock-blocking me, man. I’m trying to smash a five. Help me out. What are you doing? Why are you doing this? Times are tough.',\n",
       "  ' Who are you? But I like it. It’s my second home. This is my first home. L.A.’s my second home, and I do like it. There is things about it that I like. I live now in Los Angeles in a neighborhood called West Hollywood. West Hollywood is a gay neighborhood. It’s kind of like up here. It’s like where we are right now, Boystown. I like the gay neighborhood. The gay neighborhood is the best neighborhood. I’ve ever lived in in my life. It’s safe. It’s beautiful. I love it. I love it. You get in where you fit in, and I fit into that neighborhood, okay? I’m not gay, Dad, but… I’m down to live around gay people. They keep it clean and safe. I’ve never been attacked once in my neighborhood, and by the way, if I did get attacked, I would love to be attacked. What a beautiful way to walk home. A guy leaps out of a bush. Where are you going? Where are you going? Where? Where? Gives me outfit tips. They can fly, you know. I have a lot of gay friends because of that. They’re people just like you and me. There’s nothing different. There’s nothing different about that neighborhood. It’s cleaner and safer, and I fucking love it. The only difference is, I got a big beard. I’ve had big beard. I got to keep a big beard for a while. And that’s okay. Gay guys love guys with beards. Why? I don’t know. It’s a thing. It’s an underbelly thing. It’s on the Internet. Look it up. And I often get hit on. I get hit on a lot, okay? I get hit on way more in the gay community than in the straight community, and I’m okay with that. It’s a confidence booster, fellas. It feels nice. But I’ve lived in a gay neighborhood for so long that now I’m picky about what gay guy hits on me. A gay guy hollers at me, and I’m like, ‘All right, you couldn’t handle it, dude. ‘You couldn’ t handle it. Too tight, too tight. ‘Keep walking, man. Pinch it right off. Get up out of here, man.’ Couldn’t have it. That’s some true shit. You got to be careful of social cues. Social cues mean a lot, right? And guys are stupid. Men are stupid. We’re stupid people by nature. We’re just dumb. We don’t give a shit, by the way, when girls are like, ‘Men are dumb.’ I don’t care. You think I care you think I’m dumb? I don’t give a shit. I know I’m dumb. It feels really good. Try going out your day without talking about a relationship. That’s what you guys do all day. It’s like, ‘I heard he was with her, but then she was’… And we just walk around like… It’s great. It’s fantastic. I don’t worry about shit. It makes my day so much easier, but guys are idiots, and I’m proud to be an idiot. But social cues amongst men are interesting because you got to be careful what you do in my neighborhood, right? Like, in my neighborhood, it’s a little bit different, ’cause when I walk down the street and I see another guy, right, I do this thing. If I see you, and I walk down the street, right, we pass each other, and I go like this, what do you do? If I go like… Yeah, you dude me right back, right. You dude me right back. He dudes me. We dude it. Hey, dude it. We dude it. Do we know why we dude? No. Zero clue. We walk around like pigeons all day like, ‘Hey, hey.’ We don’t give a shit. I do it to black guys to show them that I’m not a pussy. I go, ‘Hey, what’ s up? We good, we good? ‘We’re good. I’m good with the black guy. ‘In case a fight breaks out, we got a black guy. ‘We’ re good. We got one. We’re good, we’re good. We got him.’ I have no idea why we do that. We share genitalia. There’s no other reason that we do that to one another. But you can’t do that in my neighborhood ’cause it means something totally different… and it hurts. It hurts a lot. I like living there. I do like it. I really do. Like, I like living in Los Angeles. I like progressive culture, okay? I really do. I like the way that people think about other people as humans instead of a subset, right? This country got all up in arms. Everybody voted to make bathrooms gender-neutral. I don’t know if you know about that, but there was a big debate going on around this country about should we make bathrooms gender… Should we be able to let other people use bathrooms that didn’t initially have that genitalia, right? People that are transsexual. Should we let them use our bathrooms? Ooh, careful. Who knows what could happen? What could happen? Nothing. They’re gonna shit in your bathroom that you shit in. You think your bathroom’s that important, where you let go of all your fluids. You care that much about your fluids that you care who comes after. When I go in there, I ‘m like,’ Aah! ‘There better be someone else decent that comes in after me. ‘I don’ t want some transsexual coming in after that. Who knows what they ‘ll do?’ Who do you think you are? It was a big debate, gender-neutral bathrooms. And I’m all for it. Bathrooms are bathrooms. I don’t give a shit who uses my bathroom after me. Use it. You got to go, go ahead. Use the bathroom, man. It’s a good thing. For years, I was sick and tired of going to a bar and seeing girls cut the bathroom line when theirs are too long. They walk to the guys, and they go, ‘Hi, our line’ s too long. ‘Do you think me… Can we cut? Is this chill if we cut?’ I know that’s a stereotypical impression. I don’t give a shit. That’s real. ‘Can we cut?’ That’s real. And every asshole in line is like, ‘Yeah, go ahead.’ Also real, also real, also a real impression of us. You go like that. We go like that. Okay? So guys let them in, and I’m tired of that shit, ’cause we can’t use your bathrooms. Guys can’t use girls’ bathrooms at bars. You can use ours. Why can’t we use yours? The only thing I ever hear is, ‘Well, you pee on the seat.’ Do we? I don’t. I don’t pee on the seat. If you live with someone that pees on the seat, it’s ’cause they hate your fucking guts. They’re sending you a message. Oh, no, you get the groceries, Karen, you fucking bitch. Fucking asshole. He’s saying something to you. That’s between you two. What do you think? You think we walk in the bathroom, we just open it up, and let it go, and it’s, like, wherever it goes, it goes. I know where it goes. I got a laser pointer. I know precisely where it goes. Pff, right there. Pee on the seat. That’s amazing. It’s ridiculous. To me, I think the fix has always been remove the stalls from men’s bathrooms in bars. Remove them. Urinals or just holes in the ground, it doesn’t really matter. Guys will pee into anything. We don’t really give a shit. But get the stalls out of men’s bathrooms in bars because they shouldn’t be there in the first place, okay? They should never have been there, ’cause a girl can’t walk in now and use a urinal. Unless you can, ladies, and then I want to see it. If you can tippy-toe pee, I would love to see it. I don’t know if it’s this way or that way. I don’t know which way is better, but if you can do that, I want to check it out. But there shouldn’t be stalls in men’s bathrooms in bars in the first place, because who the fuck is pooping at the bar? You’re gonna poop at the bar? You’re gonna poop here? Steve, you’re gonna poop at the bar. The bar that we’re at, you’re gonna poop at this bar? You feel okay with that as a person, pooping at the bar? Okay, now I know who you really are. Pooping at the… Who are your friends? Who’s your family? Go home, you animal. What are you, you pig person? Poop at the bar? Are you out of your mind? You’re gross. You’re a gross human. You don’t poop at the bar. You man up if you have to poop. You man up if you have to poop. You finish your drink, pinch it off, and you walk home, so you can poop at the house naked like a grown-up… like a full-grown adult. If you’re pooping at the bar that I’m at and I see you doing that, I’m gonna walk in, look under, walk out, and go, ‘Hey, there’ s a guy pooping here ‘wearing blue Adidas. Blue Adidas, yeah. He ‘s pooping right now.’ And then leave you with your mistake. Why is everybody looking at my shoes? ‘Cause you pooped here, Mike. What’s wrong with you? Get your life locked up, pig. Go home, you pig. Say that next time you see someone pooping in a bathroom. Walk in and go, ‘Go home, you pig. You make me sick.’ Unbelievable, man, how we prote… We protect the bathrooms like they’re a big deal. Who gives a shit about the bathrooms? Dude, go to the bathroom. We protect bathrooms in this country like it’s something important. It’s remarkable to me. Sometimes you go to a restaurant, and you’re like, ‘Hey, can I get the key to the bathroom? It’s locked.’ They’re like, ‘Oh, yeah, we got the key. Here you go.’ It’s attached to a comically large ladle for no reason. You got a spoon on the goddamn thing. Now you got to take that in there, find a place for it. It’s gonna be a nightmare. Go ahead. You’re gonna hate every second of that. Why do we do that? We lock them. You keep the bathroom under lock and key? You realize in every restaurant, every restaurant you can walk right in, go right into the kitchen? There’s no locks on a kitchen. Just walk in and go, ‘Hey, what’s up, you guys?’ Dunk your hand in some soup. More salt. Needs more salt. I got to go. I want to use the bathroom. You got the key? No. Get real. It’s a weird country, man. We live in a weird country. We live in a weird time. I didn’t want to talk about anything that’s going on right now, but because I got a lot of time, it’s the late show, I’ll do whatever the fuck I want. So let me say this. I’m proud to be from where I’m from, okay? I’m proud to be from Chicago, Illinois. I’m proud to be from the United States of America. I’m not trying to get on a patriotic kick. All I want to say is, we got some fucked-up things going on in our country. Times are really crazy. It’s unfortunate as fuck. It’s awful. People on both sides are blaming people on both sides, okay? I have cops that are in my family. Every cop is not a bad fucking person, and every person isn’t a bad person, right? These are the same fucking things. So don’t point fingers at either side. We need to be better people in general, across the fucking board. That’s it. That’s it. Good. I’m a… I’m a guy who recently, thankfully, found a woman who was dumb enough to stick around. Stupid girl, stupid girl. ‘Cause look at this, you know. Like, look at guys. You’re gross. Why would they even go for us? Why would a woman want to do stuff with you? You’re gross. You’re disgusting. Look at a naked woman. Take one look at a naked woman, right? Beautiful, symmetrical, hairless. What a creature. Whatever made it finely crafted it like a Ferrari, you know? Took time with it. And then they got to the guy, and they were like, ‘Ah, we ran out of time. ‘No, put the genitals on the outside. ‘It doesn’ t matter. ‘No one’ s gonna see. Who cares? ‘Hair? Throw some hair on it. Fine, throw some hair on it.’ It’s phenomenal. Every day we’ve fooled you. Like, we should wake up, guys, and just be like, ‘Ah, tricked them. ‘We tricked them again. We got away with murder.’ I don’t know how we ever convinced you to do anything in the first place. Kiss me where I pee? Kiss me where I pee? How? How? How? You know that place that you breathe and eat from? May I stuff my dick in there? Can I clog up your source of life with some flesh? Life, the life hole, can I just… Cork it? I want to cork it. I want to cork your life hole with my body. How on earth did you say yes? Cork it? It’s a remarkable thing, when you think about it. Like, how did we ever even start the sexual chemistry to even get to that level of doing stuff? Here you go. A guy can go to a bar. A single guy goes to a bar trying to pick up chicks. He can go out there and mumble around. I want to put my body in your body. That’s all he’s saying. Baseline level, I want to put my body in your body. Can we do that? You sound debonair ',\n",
       "  'at the bar. You ‘re like,’ Well, well, I work for an investment firm downtown.’ But what you’re really saying is, like, ‘I want to put my body in your body. I’d like to put my body inside of your body.’ That’s all it is. You’re not that cool. You’re just trying to put some of your body in someone’s body. You got a gap. I got a wedge. Can we do the thing when I put the thing in the thing? That’s it. Think about that… That’s a hard thing to do, to go out to a bar and convince a girl I’m the guy that you want to do things with. Think about how hard it was for us to start that. How did we start that? How did a caveman ever get to that point with a cave woman? How did a caveman say that when there was no language, no communication skills? First of all, when you were a caveman, you just stood around with your buddies, mumbling. That’s it. There’s really nothing going on, just a lot of… Then one of you, out of nowhere, would just get an erection. Explain that to the crew. All your buddies are mad. Hey! They don’t like it pointing at them. You got to be a nonverbal dick salesman, going up to women like… What are you selling? She doesn’t know. You can’t say it. Who said yes? The slowest girl in the pack… on a bad leg she was lugging around. Okay, okay. Okay. How did that happen? The guy that convinced a girl to do that for the first time invented fire and the wheel that afternoon. It was like… Everything clicked. I got it. Everything made sense. I would’ve loved to see the first caveman to discover pulling out. That would’ve been amazing. Right? The first guy that’s like… That’s how all that shit on the wall got started. They were like… What, do you think that was ink? That was no ink. It’s jizz symbols. How great is that fucking thing? My buddy’s an artist, and I was like, ‘I want a fucking papa bear ‘with a cubby bear with a Blackhawks headdress, ‘and I want him wearing Jordans for the Bulls ‘and white socks, and I want him eating deep dish and drinking a beer.’ And my buddy smoked enough pot as I did, and he came up with this. So it was fucking pretty amazing. The Chicago flag, yeah. Cool. It’s cool. We got a lot of pride in this town, so we should. You know what I mean? You can’t fuck with us. Come fuck with us. Where’s my crane camera? Come fuck with us, rest of the United States. Where the fuck are you guys at? Come to Chicago. Rip your fucking throats out. I’m gonna get murdered on the road in Cincinnati in, like, three months. Shit. No, I got a lady. I got a lady this year. I got locked up. I got married this year, which was great. It was a great thing. Don’t clap for that. Please don’t clap for that shit ’cause it eggs her on, and I don’t need that. No, I got married, and it was great. It was very fun. We had a good time. Yeah, it was fun. Thanks a lot. Cool. It was cool, it was cool. She came up to me at the jump, and she was like, she ‘s like,’ What do you think about doing, like, bachelor, bachelorette parties, like, all that stuff?’ We didn’t talk about, like, really any of that stuff. We really kind of didn’t really get into the nitty-gritty, and I was like, ‘Well, whatever you want to do.’ She was like, ‘Do you want to have a bachelor party?’ And I was like, ‘I don’ t know. ‘Like, I do stand-up for a living, ‘so, like, it’ s just always kind of a fucking bachelor party. My life is kind of a bachelor party.’ I was like, ‘No, I’m good.’ You know what I mean? Like, I just took my best friend for his bachelor party, and I was like, ‘That’s good enough for me.’ I was like, ‘You can do a bachelorette party. Don ‘t feel like you can’t.’ She was like, ‘Are you cool with it?’ I was like, ‘I promise. I’m totally cool with it. Whatever you want to do, you ‘re good. Do it.’ She was like, ‘Okay, trust me. It ‘ll be classy.’ That’s some dumb shit. Girls are like, ‘It’ s gonna be classy. ‘The bachelorette party… It’s gonna be cla… I promise. We won’t be as crazy as you think we’re gonna be.’ She was like, ‘We’ re going to Northern California ‘to a vineyard. We ‘re gonna do wine tasting.’ So in girls’ brains, they think that we think that that’s nice and sweet, but I know the truth. I know they’re not wine tasting. I know they’re blacking out on wine. I know they’re getting purple toothed out, Charlie Chaplain-ing around town like… I know. I know what you’re doing, looking like Grimace. I know. I know. Lie to me, you drunks… trying to pretend like… We pretend like wine is so sophisticated. It’s still booze. Stinky-foot grapes, that’s all it is. Go on a vineyard tour with her girlfriends. See, ’cause here’s the thing about bachelorette parties. I’m sure every girl in this room is a wonderful human being. I’m sure you’re all stand-up citizens until you get in a bachelorette party, and then you’re a piece of shit. Then you’re a piece of shit. Then you storm around town like, ‘Look at us, penises everywhere. ‘Penises on our body. ‘Penis necklace. These are dick-laces. ‘These are dick necklaces. This is a dick hat. ‘These are dick glasses. They’re dick shoes. ‘Look at it. It comes. This one comes. ‘It comes out of that shoe. When I go like that, it comes.’ What’s wrong with you? Who are your parents? Shame on you, these women who walk around town doing that shit. It’s unbelievable… Bachelorette parties that take over every bar they go to, screaming. These bitches work in HR during the day, but at night… they’re just like, ‘Penis, penis, penis. Penis, penis, penis, penis.’ Who are your parents? Shame on you. You realize some little kid in China has to make those penis molds? Some little kid in China is pressing penises, penis sunglasses, so you can go out like, ‘Cocks, cocks on my head.’ You psycho. That’s where guys beat you. That’s, like, the one spot we beat you. We may be dumber than you, but we beat you there. We beat you by a landslide, because I have never been to a bachelor party where they’re like, ‘Santino, you ready to go? Put on your pussy costume. Let ‘s go.’ I put one on like… ‘Come on, let’ s go. ‘Get mine wet. Steve, get mine wet. ‘Get it wet. Get the clit wet. ‘Go. Get it wet. This is what we want.’ ‘Vaginer.’ We beat you. So we went and got married out of the country. We went to Costa Rica. We went down to Costa Rica. It was great. Central America, beautiful place. Costa Rica is amazing. We loved it. It was fantastic. I didn’t know that racism is everywhere. I had no idea, but it is, but it really fucking is. Here we are in our hotel, two men are in a fight with one man, two guys on one, two on one, working this dude, and I look out the window, and I’m like, ‘Oh, my God, what happened?’ To the local guy. And the local guy, who we know, who we’re buddies with, is like, ‘Oh, yeah, the fight?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, what happened?’ I’m ready for the story. And he ‘s like,’ Okay, you see this guy on the ground? ‘You see him on the ground, ‘this guy who they kick in the face? ‘You see him? ‘You know, this guy on the ground they kick in the teeth. You see him?’ I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, definitely. Yeah, what is that?’ And he goes, ‘Oh, yeah, this guy, this guy on the ground, he ‘s from Panama.’ What? ‘He’ s from Panama. Panama, the country. Panama.’ That’s it? That was as deep as the well got dug. ‘He’s from Panama.’ That’s it. I was like, ‘But how did the fight… Like, how did you… How did the fight happen?’ He goes, ‘Oh, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí, sí. ‘Okay, so this guy on the ground, ‘he cut off this guy in traffic, ‘and he says to him, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Hey, man, fuck you.’ ‘So this guy, he gets out of his car, ‘and he says, ‘Mm-mm, fuck you.’ ‘So then they yell at each other. ‘So this guy say fuck you. ‘This guy, fuck you. This guy, fuck… So both of these guys are fucking you right now.’ I was like, ‘No one’ s fucking me. What are you talking about?’ ‘And then his friend, he hear him from across the street, ‘and his friend, he says, ‘Hey, what happened?’ ‘He says, ‘He said, fuck you.’ ‘He says,’ Ah, fuck you.’ ‘He says, ‘Fuck you.’ He says. ‘Fuck you.’ He fuck… these guys over here are fucking you.’ ‘And the one guy, he says to him… ‘Before he fight with him, he says, ”Hey, motherfucker, where are you from?’ ‘And this guy, he says, ‘Panama.’ ‘And, uh… That ‘s it for him.’ Other than that, it was a beautiful country, man. It was gorgeous, man. We did so much white-people shit. It was unbelievable. You know what white-people shit is. Everybody in here knows it, right? It’s, like… We went zip-lining. It’s, like, white-water rafting, all that white-people… White-water rafting is white-people shit. It’s called white-water rafting. It’s ours. That’s some white-people shit. You’ll never, ever see a black guy white-water rafting, skydiving, drinking coffee. That’s just not what they do. It’s not what they do. Skydiving, all that shit. Black guy, do you go skydiving? Never in your fucking life, man. No way. Never in your life. Rock climbing? No way. White-water rafting? No. None of the above. Do you even like coffee? I do like coffee. Oh, come on, man. What did he say? I like it black. You like it black. I get that. I get that. You can have that. Take it black. Take it black. So he knows what I’m talking about. He knows. I went to college with… One of my closest friends in college was this dude we lived with, and he would always make fun of me. He ‘s like,’ You’re doing some white-people shit, Red. You on some white-people shit right now.’ I was like, ‘I’m taking out the trash.’ He’s like… ‘That’s the type of shit I’m talking about, motherfucker. ‘Just throw that shit outside, bitch. ‘White-people shit! ‘What you doing, dishes, motherfucker? You white-ass motherfucker.’ What you doing, laundry, you Charmin-ass motherfucker? You Charmin’… I did so much white-people shit in Costa Rica. It was bananas. I loved it, though. I love being a tourist. Like, that’s the fucked-up thing about Americans. We don’t want to be tourists. Why not? Why are we so afraid of being tourists? I’ll do that zip-line dork-ass shit. Give me the helmet. I love that. How much is the picture? $1,000? I don’t give a shit. I’ll pay for that, plan for it. Come on, man. Give me that dork tourist shit. We’re so afraid as Americans to be tourists. Yet for some reason, tourists come here. They’re not afraid to be tourists. You can go to Michigan Avenue right now. There’s a cute little Italian couple that’s like, ‘Mi scusi, mi scusi, mi scusi. The water tower, the water tower.’ And you ‘re like,’ Ah, come here. Let me lie to you. Come here, come here, come here.’ Let them be tourists, man. Be a tourist. Be a tourist. All I’m saying is, stop being such a liar. Be who you really are. You’re out of the country. Be out of the country, man. There’s nothing wrong with that, you know. Here’s why. Every time I’ve ever been to a Spanish-speaking country, there’s always one guy in the crew, one dude who’s like, ‘Hey, I got us. I can take us around. ‘I speak a little bit of Mexican. ‘We’ re gonna be good. We ‘ll be good.’ You speak Mexican, Brad? I speak Mexican, dog. I got us. Don’t sweat it, man. I took 101 in high school. We’re gonna be straight. And you’re like, ‘All right, man. I can’t wait.’ You walk into a restaurant. I say the truth. I walk in, I go, ‘Hello, American, americano, ‘American, ready to be ripped off. Look at me.’ ‘Cause I don’t give a shit. How much is that Coke? Seven? Thought it was ten. You can’t fuck me. You can’t fuck me. I planned for that. You cannot fuck me. But he walks in. Brad walks in, talking Mexican like, ‘Hola, seniors. Hola, seniors.’ He thinks he’s the shit. Brad walks in heavy, and the staff looks at him like, ‘Okay, okay, okay, okay. ¿Habla español, señor? ¿Habla español? ¿Habla español?’ Sí, sí, sen-yours. Sí, sí, sen-yours. Ha',\n",
       "  '-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. Ha-blah a-spaniel. And they ‘re all like,’ Okay. ‘Hmm. Good, good, good. That’s good, good. That’s good.’ And they just machine-gun Spanish at his fucking head until you see him go, ‘Oh, fuck. ‘There’s no bibliotecain there. Where’s the ban-yo? I don’t know any of those words.’ Brad looks like an asshole. Meanwhile, I’m enjoying my plate of rice and ‘polo,’ having a great time… enjoying my life. I came back from Costa Rica. It was fantastic, and then we got into that, like, all the marriage discussion shit. She was like, ‘What do you want to do about the last name?’ I was like, ‘I don’ t know. I mean, I don’t really care. I don’t think I really care.’ I was like, ‘I mean, what do you want to do?’ She’s like, ‘Well, do you want me to take your last name?’ And there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘No, man, it’s cool.’ Then there’s a part of you that’s like, ‘Yeah, you got to take the last name.’ It’s some male-ego bullshit, but that’s the truth of the situation. Like, it doesn’t really mean much. Like, what are last names anyway? I don’t really know. We don’t really know, you know. Last names… you used to give to somebody ’cause it represented land, right? You had some land. You get some land to give. Like, ‘This will all be yours one day.’ That doesn’t mean shit nowadays. I can’t be like, ‘Son, this condominium will be yours when I die.’ Who gives a shit, right? There’s not much to it. You know, it really doesn’t mean much. But it’s strange when I think about, like, white people’s last names, like, where our last names came from. A lot of times, it used to be your occupation, right? Like, I meet a guy… Kevin Blacksmith. His great-great-great-great- grandfather was a blacksmith. Dave Shoemaker, his great-great-great-great- grandfather was a shoemaker. But it’s weird when you meet a white guy named Eric Lynch… ‘Cause you’re like, ‘Your great-great-great-great- grandfather was a bad person.’ Switch it up, dog. But last names are kind of bullshit. You know know what I mean? They mean whatever they want and whatever you want them to mean, and so she said, ‘What do you want to do?’ I said, ‘How about we just go with whosever last name is cooler?’ Right, whosever’s is cooler. She was like, ‘Cooler?’ I was like, ‘Yeah,’ ’cause in my head, I knew it was already game over. I was like, ‘Jordan, buckets.’ I knew it was over. I knew it was over. She wasn’t fucking with Santino. What a cool-ass name, Santino. Three syllables… San, unh, ti, got you, oh. That’s what’s up. I had it. It was in the bag, man. It was in the bag. It was game over. Jordan. It was game over, but then she was like, ‘Oh, you think your last name is that much cooler?’ I said, ‘Yeah.’ Her last name was Eichelberger. You want me to say it again? Eichelberger. And she’s like, ‘What’s wrong with that?’ I was like, ‘What’ s right with that shit? What are you talking about, lady?’ She’s like, ‘It’s not that big of a deal.’ I said, ‘Well, it’s like part of the Third Reich.’ I’ll have to walk into restaurants, like… ‘We’ re here for the Eichelberger party, ‘the party of two. ‘There is two of us at the party. ‘We would like the table in the back of the room. ‘In the back of the room, ‘behind the air-conditioning, please. Thank you.’ Anyway, she’s a Santino now. Yeah. We got into a thing, ’cause I was… I feel like I’m watching too much porn lately, if I’m just being real with you guys. We’re getting real. It’s a late-night show. I was watching too much porn. Porn is bad. It’s a bad thing. It’s really addictive. It is. It truly is. I think it’s not my fault, though. I think it’s access… access, too much access. In your pockets, there’s a phone, right? In there is all the porno… All of it… all of it that we make. All of it that we make, you guys. If I had three seconds inside of a time machine, I would ‘zorb’ myself to when I was 14, for three seconds, and just go… ‘In the future, all the porno’s in your pocket,’. And get out… and blow my mind. Just… semen everywhere. Oh, my God. I’m waiting for this JPEG to load. Come on, man. That’s crazy. That is crazy to think about. It really is too much access. Like, I can’t walk past a laptop without being like… ‘Ah, this is Best Buy. I got to go.’ The Blue Shirts, they don’t like that. You know what I mean? They get weird. We’ve seen so much of it. The problem is… With porn is, it’s got this stigma where we think we can emulate that stuff. Like, you think you’re like them. You’re not like them. Those are pros, man. Those are pros. I got envy. I have envy, envy. The way that these men throw a rope is remarkable. They just… It takes off. It’s got loft. Are you kidding me? I’m lucky if mine comes out. It’s like a pensive army. It gets to the surface, and it ‘s like,’ No, no. Go back, go back.’ And when it does come out, it’s late for the party. It has nonalcoholic beer. It’s like, ‘Sorry. We’re here.’ My wife… one night she was like, ‘Oh, come on my tits.’ I was like, ‘Oh, I’ll never make it up there.’ It’s so far. It’s too far. Maybe your belly button, max… if I really put in the work. I’ll tell you what I’ve been watching a lot of. I’ve been watching a lot of black porn, lots of black porn. Blackblack. Too. Like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. Deep chocolate, 99% cacao chocolate. Sexy. No milk. Get out of here, milk chocolate. No time for you. Chocolate, chocolate. I love watching black porn, love watch… For one fundamental reason. The guys get to wear shoes… on their feet. Men wear shoes on their feet. If you know anything about how shoes and pants work, anything at all, you know that these men took off their shoes, took off their pants and underwear, and then put back on their shoes. Come on. You did it again, black people. Numero uno. I got the envy, man. It’s a bad thing. It really is. It’s a bad thing. We need to clean up our minds, clean up our life. You know what I mean? Get clean, clean living. Eat a smoothie, take a walk. It’s difficult, man. It’s difficult to do. People always… like, listen, I try to work out. I’m trying to be in shape. I’m trying to do all that stuff. It’s a hard thing to do. You know, fast food, going to get fast food always reminds me of what it was like when I was single, going to a one-night stand. It was like the same thing, like the exact same feeling. You’ll be looking on Google Maps to try to find out if that fast-food joint’s open, right? You’re like, ‘You up, McDonald’s? You up?’ You send a late-night text, like, ‘What’ s up, girl? ‘You up? What’s up, McDonald’s? ‘You up? What’s up, Mac D’s? Is you up, playboy? Give me them nuggets.’ She’s like, ‘Uh-huh.’ McDonald’s is like, ‘You know it.’ You cruise over there, and on the way, you’re like, ‘Ooh, it’ s gonna be good. ‘I know what I get at this location. ‘This is my favorite spot to go to at this time of night. That number two is my spot right now.’ That’s a butt joke. You get over there, and you eat that. You devour that McDiesel’s. Just like that, you’re like… Devour it. And when you’re done, you get in the car and cruise home… Same feeling. Cruising home, and you’re like… ‘I’m a bad person, man.’ Sad. I had to cut that out. I had to cut it out, man. I’m trying to stay healthy. I’m trying to fit into my own skin. That’s really what it is. You know, I’m trying to feel good about myself. It’s a confidence thing about people. You want to feel confident and cocky, but, like, not too much. Like, I had my ego tested. I got into a car accident. A man hit me. A man hit me. I was at a red light. A man hit me, okay? Red light, skrrr, man, bmm-bmm-bmm, hit me, and I got out of my car. He got out of his car, and I went to say something. Before I could say anything, he goes, ‘Hey, what the fuck?’ And I said… ‘That’ s my line. ‘I say that. That’s me. ‘I’m doing… That’s what I do. You say, ‘I’m sorry,’ I feel like.’ He was a big-ass dude. He was big, jacked up, and he had tattoos up to his face? Question mark. You good, bro? On your face? You cashed out? You got cancer? What’s up? On your face? I feel like that’s some, like, ‘I don’t give a… ‘Whatever, bro. Go ahead. It’s done. ‘I don’ t give a shit. ‘I’ ve been collecting Marlboro miles for years. I ‘ll cash out.’ On your face? So I had no way to win this war. This dude was in my face. I had no… I was backed up. I was like, ‘Whatever, man.’ And in that moment, I was like, ‘I can’ t win this argument with this dude. I can ‘t beat him physically.’ But I was like, ‘If I had a superpower right now, ‘you know, it wouldn’ t be to, like, fly or be invisible. I would love to be able to throw acne on somebody.’ Right? He’s all, ‘Fuck you.’ I’m like, ‘Fuck me? Fuck you, man.’ No! Hit him all over the body, shoulder, bacne. Hit him with the bacne. Hit him with the kn-acne, that knee acne. Light him up, light him up. Scar him physically and emotionally, send him home like that for a couple of weeks, depending on the topical cream. Let it sit. Let it sit. If you’re not laughing at that, you didn’t have acne when you were a kid. I had really bad acne when I was a kid, man. It was so bad. It was so bad. Like, acne is, like, the sole reason I questioned God. I’m like, ‘What up, dude? What’s the deal? ‘Where are you at on this one, player? This is ridiculous.’ Here you are, 13, 14 years old. You’re the ugliest version of yourself. Look at photos of you at 14. TBT them on Instagram, and you’re like, ‘Ooh, tough-looking kid.’ You’re ugly, bro. You are ugly at 14. Teenagers are so gross to look at, hard to see. They’re hard to see, bro. They’re skinny. Their voices are crackling. They’re wobbling all over like little skinny baby giraffes, just hungry and horny like… Nasty-looking crea… They look like Tim Burton cartoons. They’re barely alive. You are nasty as a child. And you’re telling me at this vulnerable point in your life, God is gonna be like, ‘You know what? ‘I’ m gonna put some red pus bumps on his face. Pus bump his face up.’ I didn’t get it. I didn’t understand it. I had it so bad. I had to go on Accutane. You used to have to sign a form that said. ‘I can die from this medication.’ What’s up, guys? What are we saying? I can die from this medi… I can die from this medication. And I was underage, so I had a legal guardian. So my mother had to sign it. I was 16. I’ll never forget. They slipped the sheet to my mother, and she looked at it, and then she looked at me. Yeah. Yeah, this is… it’s… it’s better than your face. It doesn’t really matter. You’re an ugly kid. You’re ugly. It’s… it’s for you. I had it so bad. I had acne so bad when I was young. When I was in high school, I played basketball for a couple years at my high school until I found out about drugs, and I was like, ‘See you later, basketball.’ Ah, true story. But I played basketball for a little while. When I played basketball, I made the JV team pretty early on, and we played in a summer league, okay? In the summer league, you had to play all the other schools that you were going to play in that regular season, and I’ll never forget. We went out to West Aurora to go play these guys, and they were supposed to beat us. They were, like, a really good school, right? They were really good. They were an all-black school. We were a some-black school. They were gonna beat us. Bottom line, they were gonna win. And we went out there, and we beat the shit out of these guys. I had the game of my life. I dropped four points. I was on fire. If you know anything about high-school basketball, four points is like, whoa. What are you, MVP? Final score, 12-2. It was a blowout. I mean, we went out there. I had a great game. I was on cloud nine. I felt like a king. Then I left, and I went out to the hallway to go get a drink of water. I’m getting ',\n",
       "  'a drink of water, bending down by the water fountain to have a drink of water. A little black kid, like, eight years old walks in the hallway. Comes up to me and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy. White boy.’ I go, ‘What’s up?’ You’re pretty good, man. Oh, thanks, man. He goes, ‘For a white boy.’ And I was still like, ‘Thank you. I appreciate that.’ I’ll take it. Then he goes, ‘All right, man.’ I go, ‘All right, man.’ He walks away. Felt good. Go down to get some more water. He gets to the doorway. He stops… real Forest Whitaker-style. He turns around and goes, ‘Hey, yo, white boy.’ I say, ‘What’s up, man? What up?’ He goes, ‘What the fuck is all over your face?’ That still hurts today. I’m in my 30s. That cut went all the way to the bone. You know what I mean? Then I walked up to him slowly, and I said, ‘Well, this is what happens when your dad sticks around.’ No, I didn’t say that. That’s a joke, man. No, I called him the N word. Then I got out of there as fast as I could. No, stop it. I cried on the bus, man. I cried on the bus. Got to have a sense of humor, man. But I always loved black people. I always did. I really did. I still do. I still do love black people, man. I think they’re fantastic human beings. Black people always accepted me. Black people really did. White people never liked me. White people don’t like redheads for some reason. There’s this thing. White people see redheads, and they’re like, ‘What do we do with it?’ They don’t like us. They don’t trust us. They make a day to kick us. Call us names… ‘You fire crotch, you ginger.’ They ask us stupid questions, like does the carpet match the drapes? A black guy’s never said that to me. White guys… ‘The carpet match the drapes, bud?’ And I’m always like, ‘Are you a grown-up asking ‘about my penis hair? ‘Is that the level that you’re on? ‘You’ re worried about my penis hair, dude. ‘If you must know, it’s hardwood floors. There ‘s no carpet there, bro.’ I clean it up. Go get you a little buzzer from Target and clean that shit up. You get under there. It’s like… It’s working overtime under there. That’s the no-fly zone, no-fly zone. It might die under there, like… I can’t, I can’t. White people never liked me. They never did. They always made fun of me. That’s a reality check. Now people are like, ‘Huh? What are you talking about?’ White people always made fun of redheads. Redheads are this outcast. We’re this weird minority for some reason, but black people always liked me. They really did. They took to me. Like, black people like white people with a deficiency. I’m like a dog with one bad leg. You know, white people don’t adopt that dog, but black people are like, ‘No, no, no. ‘He good, he good, he good. ‘He gonna be fine. Come here, Tripod. ‘He gonna be fine. Tripod. ‘Come here, Tripod. It gonna work out.’ That’s just the truth. It just made me feel normal when I was a kid. So I loved hip-hop culture. I loved everything all my black friends liked, so much so that in the ’90s, people used to say this word. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ Do you remember that word? Don’t get uncomfortable. You all said it. You all said it. I don’t know why we got rid of it. It was hilarious. You should’ve stuck around for a while. People used to call me a ‘wigger.’ People used to say ‘wigger’ to me ’cause they thought it would hurt my feelings. They thought, like, that was a way to get my goat. You know what I mean? And I’ll never forget. I was on a basketball court the first time I heard it, and we had won this basketball game, and this dude from the losing team says… ‘Whatever, bro. That dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And all my black friends heard it, and they were disappointed. They heard him say that, and they were like… That’s how they sound, like a train. They were like… When black guys are bummed out, it sounds like a train, just… Next stop, Sedgwick. But they were bummed out ’cause that was an attack, you know. They didn’t like that, but when I heard it, I heard it different, ’cause they were like, ‘That white dude ain’t nothing but a wigger.’ And I heard it, and I was like, ‘Oh… so close.’ How do I get that N? How do I get that N? These are Karl Kani jeans. This is a Perry Ellis shirt. Give it to me. I bought Timberland boots. Say it if you’re gonna say it, you racist motherfuckers. Say it. How do I get that, man? It was just me being real. That’s all that was. I wanted to be a black guy. I thought I was black. I thought I was a black guy. Even to this day, I still have a lot of black friends, and I got to tell you… Every time I talk to my black guy friends, I’m always like, ‘Hey, man, don’t date white girls.’ Don’t date white girls. Not ’cause I’m racist. I’m clearly not racist. I have black friends. I’m not a racist. I tell my black guy friends to not date white girls ’cause I genuinely care about the future of sports. That’s it. We don’t need any placekickers and long snappers. We want dunk contests, right? How do you get a Heisman? You know what I mean? Not from Jerome and Cassie. Jerome and Jaquanda… That’s how we’re gonna make a Heisman, two beautiful chocolate people making love under a beautiful chocolate rain shower while he’s got shoes on. We know the formula. We know the formula. Drake is the number-one dude in hip-hop. His name is Aubrey. Yeah! We let him get away with that. Drake’s name is Aubrey, and nobody said shit about it. Aubrey, number one in hip-hop. What’s his name, Aubrey? Got it. Okay, cool. We’re good. He had beef with Meek Mill. It was a big beef. You’re it. Tag, you’re it. You’re it. Tag. Remember real beef? You remember when hip-hop was, like, real beef? People hated each other. Tupac and Biggie hated each other so much, and they were best friends at one point. They had real beef so deep that Tupac started a song called ‘Hit ‘Em Up’… Before he started the lyrics, he goes, ‘So I fucked your bitch, you fat motherfucker.’ That’s what he said. You’re fat. Fucked your girlfriend. Okay, let’s go. Here we go. That’s crazy. That’s how much he hated that guy. That’s real beef. I feel like hip-hop has, like, dissipated, you know. It’s just, like, gone by the wayside, and I blame one person for the death of hip-hop. His name is Macklemore. That dude is the worst. That dude is the worst. Macklemore is at fault for all this shit going south. Macklemore is not hip-hop. You can like him, but he’s not hip-hop, okay? That’s pop. He talks about going downtown on a scooter with his pals. Come on, bro. What? You’re gonna go downtown with your buddies on a scooter, Macklemore? That’s not hip-hop. Hip-hop doesn’t go downtown. Hip-hop lives downtown, and it goes to the suburbs and robs those people and comes back downtown. It doesn’t go downtown. Talking about thrift stores. Fuck you, bro. Don’t fucking talk about discount clothing! No! I don’t want to hear that, man. I want to hear a rapper be like… And I’m like, ‘You got it, you got it.’ That’s what I want to hear, man. I want to hear Rick Ross be like… That’s what I want to hear. Get out of here, Macklemore. What’s wrong with you, bro? This guy’s bullshit. We can’t call him hip-hop. It’s crazy that he’s hip-hop, ’cause it’s not. It’s all some sensitive-ass shit. The thing that made me the most mad about Macklemore is he co-wrote this song he got a Grammy nomination for that arguably made him famous, right? It made him famous, right? It was called ‘Same Love.’ It was about same-sex marriage. Now, the song and the depth of the song I’m not against. I’m for same-sex marriage. I don’t give a shit who you want to marry, okay? You want to marry who you want to marry? Go crazy, man. You don’t fuck kids or animals, I don’t care. That’s it for me. No kids, no animals, we’re straight. You want to marry your toaster? Go crazy. Just don’t return that. I don’t want to buy that fucked toaster. So the song I’m okay with. It’s at the beginning of the song, the intro. He goes, ‘When I was in the third grade, I thought that I was gay.’ Remember this bullshit? I thought that I was gay. When I was in the third grade, I thought I was a gay person. That’s what he said. I thought I was one of you fellas. Thank God I’m not. I’m not, but I thought I was. I thought so. I hated that. I hated that ’cause they applauded him. They were like, ‘Oh, how bold. ‘How brave of Macklemore. ‘He thought he was a homosexual. ‘In third grade, he thought he was a homosexual. ‘He’ s not, which is good, but he thought he was. He thought he was a gay.’ And they thought that was, like, a risky thing to say… ‘I thought I was gay when I was in third grade.’ I hate that shit. You remember third grade? I do. Everybody was gay. Everybody in here in third grade was gay. You were all gay. I wore sweat pants. I played the recorder. I was very gay. I used to Rollerblade around my neighborhood, like, ‘Hey, fellas.’ I would fag out all day. Like… I was homosexual, bro. It wasn’t a question. It was a fact. That kid’s gay as shit. Little redhead gay kid skating backwards. I was gay, man. I was gay when I was in third grade. You were all gay in third grade. I would beg my mom to let me sleep at other boys’ houses every night of the week. I want to sleep at Billy’s. What are you doing over there? None of your business, Mom! Make the call, please! I was so gay in third grade. If another boy accused me of liking girls, I’d fucking murder that kid. Chicago, Illinois, I got to go. I’m Andrew Santino. Thank you so much, man. Thank you, guys. I love you, Chicago. Everybody who’s anybody has lived in this building, man. Locals, baby… Jordan, Pippen, Longley, Kerr, Paxton. You know it, dude. Ryne Sandberg used to own and live in one of those big white poles at the top. He would have to slide down for breakfast. Al Capone still lives in the basement. Not dead. It’s now called Willis, used to be called Macy’s Tower, after the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, because most of the floats are made right here in this building. It’s actually anatomically to scale… even his balls. The penis is not. They ran out of clay, but the balls are full. And if you look right beyond me, that’s the Adams Street Bridge, named, of course, after the Addams Family. Duh-na-na-na. Oh, you want a fat dick in a bun or a little dick in a bun? I don’t want any penises on the hot dog, just a regular hot dog. Okay, we’re gonna give you a Trump dog, then. Gonna give me a Trump dog? Damn right. You know what? Let me tell you something. You’re not nice, and you’re not nice to people and… We don’t give a fuck about your fucking soft ass. Yes. I’m sick of this abuse. All I want is… Save that pussy-ass shit for somebody else that want to fucking hear it. Good night, pussy lips. Right. Fine, good night. Bye, dick cheese. Get the fuck out of here. I’m leaving. Pussy nose. Well, leave. Tweet, tweety bird. Hey, Andrew, I think the crew’s gonna head out of here. Cool, man. Get out. We’re wrapped. Yeah, I’m here. Do you need a ride, or are you good? I get in my… I can walk. Okay. Cool. Good luck with your special or tour guide, whatever this is. Thanks, dude. Thank you, Bernard. Your email address will not be published.

       " [\"Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, San Francisco. Thank you so much. So good to be here. People were surprised when I told ’em I was gonna tape my special in San Francisco. Said, “Why would you do that? That’s the most politically correct city in the world.” Not when I’m on stage, it’s not. I love this place. One of my favorite cities to perform in. It’s a good place to hang out. Got to walk around a little bit today. Saw a baby. Saw a baby locked inside the back of a hot car. So it’s been a great day. Love that. Don’t get me wrong. I’m not a monster. I tried to help the baby. Tried to throw a rock through the window. Window was down. Ruined that baby’s whole weekend. It was worth it. I love San Francisco. One of my favorite things is how beautiful all the women are here. Yeah. Women in San Francisco are gorgeous. I say that despite what’s… going on in this crowd tonight. But you guys live here. You guys live here. You’ve seen ’em. I was in a bar last night, saw this beautiful woman. Like a supermodel. I walked up, I was like, “Hey, where you from? What do you do?” She goes, “Oh, me? I live here in San Francisco. I’m a brain surgeon.” I don’t know if this makes me sexist, but I was really impressed. You know? I mean… Most women… can’t pull off sarcasm. This is gonna be a good show. See, that joke, that joke is a test. To see if you guys are cool or not. That thing about the baby in the car, that’s just me clearing my throat. That joke’s the test. If you guys laugh at that joke, whole show goes great. You don’t laugh at that joke, whole show goes bad. And I’ve had shows go very, very bad. Doesn’t matter to me at all. Now, this next joke, this next joke is a test to see how cool you are. I, uh… I used to have a son. Already some of you see where this is going, that’s good. That’s good. I used to have a little two-year-old son, but he died. The same way Eric Clapton’s son died. For inspiration. I’m not gonna lie, this is the best that joke has ever done. You guys kinda laughed, then started talking to each other for some reason. Then started clapping, that is amazing. Most people just boo me. But if you didn’t understand the joke… don’t worry. It’s a complicated joke, a lot of things you gotta know. That joke is like an onion. You’ve gotta know who Eric Clapton is. Not a given these days. You’ve gotta know about his kid. You gotta know how clumsy that little lad was. You gotta know about that terrible fucking song. And then you gotta think all that’s funny. Now, I gotta get to know you guys a little bit. Starting with you for sure. I can tell you’re a big comedy fan and bat-shit insane. Did you just come from the fucking dentist or what? What is your name? – Peggy Jo. – Peggy. Peggy, what do you try to do? Not a lot, I’m disabled. You’re disabled? I know you’re disabled. Is this your husband with you? Okay. Sir, what do you do, so I can move the fuck on. – I’m an electrician. – You’re an electrician? Great. That’s an honorable job. That’s a good job to have. I’m sure you shock the shit out of her on a daily basis. Electrician. It’s a wonderful job. There’s a lot of bad jobs out there, I’ll tell you that right now. Lot of bad jobs. Hell, my Uncle John runs a summer camp for… kids about to get molested. I know, right? I know, it sounds awful. Sounds awful, but he loves it. He’s like… Says he’s never worked a day in his life. Doesn’t pay much, but the benefits… Do you guys have any kids? How many? I have one, and he has two. Okay. You guys ever done that thing where you go online and see how many sex offenders live around you? Isn’t it crazy? Isn’t it way more than you’d think? You think it might be like one or two. No, it’s like chicken pox. I went online, 15 child molesters. Fifteen child molesters within five miles of my apartment. So, why do we always have to meet at my place? And if you’re wondering, “Anthony, this is great, but are all of these jokes gonna be about hurting children?” I don’t know, probably. Seems like something I would do. I of course live in Los Angeles. I’ve got a nice place. Obviously. My brother’s been staying with me, which has been awful. My brother is crazy. Even my neighbors hate him. The other day I opened the door, I caught him masturbating. He looks me right in the eyes and goes, “Shut the door.” I said, “Get inside.” My family loves it when I put them in jokes. They love it. “Anthony, please, put me in your next joke.” “Are you sure? I’m gonna make you a pedophile.” “We don’t care. We wanna be part of this thing you’ve got going on.” So I wrote that joke, put my brother in. I’m in Chicago, where he lives. After the show, he comes backstage and I say, “Mikey, what’d you think about that new joke? Did you like the shout out?” And he gets all uncomfortable. He goes, “Well, crowd seemed to think it was funny… but I think it’s kinda weird that you got a joke where you wanna fuck me.” And I said, “What, Mikey? No! No, Mikey. You’re my brother. That’s a joke about you masturbating in front of my house.” And he goes, “Yeah, and then you’re like, ‘Get back inside.'” Just in case you guys are wondering whether my brother’s a fuckin’ idiot. Yeah, I’ve got a nice place. Try to keep it nice. Not always successful. Like, I tried getting a puppy. Disaster. Had to get rid of that puppy. Had to get rid of that puppy almost immediately. The first time I left it home alone, the first time I left that puppy home alone, that damn thing tore my entire place apart, shit everywhere, and starved to death. Why are you mad? I’m the one who couldn’t get his money back. And this is traditionally where crowds really start to turn on me. After I kill a puppy with neglect. And it’s okay. It’s okay, you can get mad at me. You can hate me. You can hate me and still laugh at me. That’s how talented I am. And I’m used to it. I’m used to it. I once dated a girl who punched me in the face as hard as she could. Once dated a girl, punched me right in the face as hard as she could. I didn’t do anything about it. I didn’t say anything about it. I just turned around and left the room. But in my head, in my head, all I was thinking was… “Now we’re even.” She was so mad. She got mad at me. She got mad at me ’cause I killed all of her plants. Killed every single one of her house plants. And she had told me. She said, “Anthony, I’m going out of town for two weeks. Give each one of these half a cup of water every other day.” But I’m a dude. All I heard was “two weeks” and “cheat on me.” Like my neighbors in L.A… My neighbors in L.A. have got this smokin’ hot 18-year-old daughter. I mean, she’s perfect. But she just got a tattoo of a butterfly over her chest. Which is horrible. Doesn’t she understand how dumb that’s gonna look some day, all stretched out over my lamp? Yeah, that’s a joke. That’s a joke where I’m a serial killer. I’m very open about it. Don’t you dare tighten up on me. I hate sensitivity. I hate it. Even when little kids get sensitive, that makes me mad. I got a six-year-old nephew. I asked what he wants for his birthday. He said, “Uncle Anthony, I want you to get me a Barbie doll.” I said, “Fuck y\",\n",
       "  'ou.” “You six-year-old piece of shit.” And don’t get me wrong. Don’t get me wrong, I don’t care if he plays with dolls. He can wear dresses if he wants to. But I’m not getting him a Barbie doll. You see, Barbie dolls give little boys unrealistic expectations… …of how easy it’s gonna be to tear off a head. I won’t do it. I get really mad when people get sensitive about comedy. If you’re sensitive about comedy, it’s the dumbest thing you can do. I call them the joke police. They always have one rule, one rule they have. You can’t make fun of this right now. After a couple years, they move on to something else, which is why it’s so hypocritical. Like the thing today, the thing right now you can’t make fun of, the thing that’s too sensitive at this moment? Trans-gendered people. See? You can’t do it. Can’t make fun of them. It’s too sensitive. In fact, you can’t even call them “chicks with dicks” anymore. No. No. You have to call them “men who talk too much.” Right? But I hear this all the time. People’ll be like, “Anthony, that was really funny. But, man, women must hate you. Women must come to your shows and hate the shit out of you.” And I always say, “No. No. Stupid women hate my shows.” “Stupid women hate my shows. Smart women… don’t come to my shows.” Speaking of which, what’s your name? – What? Kim. – Kim. – Kim, where you from? – San Jose. San Jose? Okay. What do you do, Kim? Um, I’m a branch manager. – Like for a bank? For a Pizza Hut? – No, for… What? What the fuck? Where’d you go to school? – UC Santa Cruz. – What’d you study? – Economics. – Economics? Okay. You ever gonna use that someday? I had to go to Catholic school when I was a kid. Hated Catholic school. Hated Catholic school more than anything. The nuns were vicious. They would hit me with a ruler, slap me in the face. Anything to defend themselves. You guys loved the shit out of that one, huh? Hated school. When I was in the fifth grade, one of my classmates got cancer. Came down with the cancer. Which was sad. But the story is actually cool and inspiring. Every single guy… Every single guy in the school, we all… shaved our heads to make fun of him. Yeah. No, it was great. It was great, we did it for like a month. We would have kept doin’ it, but you know. You know how cancer gets. You guys ever… You guys ever trace back your family history? Go back a couple generations in your family tree, find out embarrassing shit you wish you didn’t know? I traced my family tree back, found that I actually had family fighting on both sides in World War II. Humiliating. The piece-of-shit side of my family fought for the Nazi infantry in Germany, while the bad-ass Jeselniks were here in America spying for the Germans. I assume everyone is drinking tonight? – Yeah! – Yeah! Whoo! That’s good. I love to drink. Love it. Do it all the time, every day, always have. I don’t know where it comes from either. Even my parents tell me, when I was just a little baby, I used to climb out of my crib every morning, and then crawl over to the liquor cabinet… to try to spend time with them. I like San Francisco, so liberal. So liberal. Clap your hands here. Clap your hands if you own a gun. San Jose is in the house, huh? Not too bad. I once asked the crowd in Houston that question. They just started firing guns in the air. Didn’t even let me finish the question. I don’t own a gun. I’m against guns, to be honest. When I was a kid… When I was a kid, my parents had a gun. My parents said we had to have a gun. Gotta have a gun to protect the five children. Gotta have a gun to protect our five children. Of course, they eventually got rid of it… to protect their four children. I’m not gonna lie, it was fun while it lasted. I was getting pretty good towards the end. Man, my parents were strict. Mom and dad were strict. My mom and dad once made me smoke an entire pack of cigarettes. An entire pack of cigarettes in one sitting. Just to teach me an important lesson about brand loyalty. I learned a lot from my parents. Especially my dad. Like, I’ll never forget… the first time I ever got a bad report card in school. First time I got a bad report card, I brought it home, I gave it to my dad and my dad beat me. Beat the hell out of me. But I learned something. Because the next time I got a bad report card in school, I brought it home and I gave it to my mom. Let her take the hit. Yeah.\\nMy dad was a hard-ass. One of those guys who believed that men just learn by doing things. You know? You don’t take classes. You don’t read the instructions. You just do it and figure it out. Like, when I was a kid, I never got to take swimming lessons. No, my dad would pick me up and throw me in the water to teach himself CPR.\\nAs a kid, my dad’s prized possession, my dad’s favorite thing in the world growing up? My dad was the proud owner of a Mickey Mantle rookie card. Mickey Mantle rookie baseball card, mint condition. Kept it between two little pieces of plastic. But I was a kid. I didn’t know any better. One day I took that card to school and I traded it to a classmate for a candy bar. You know what that card is worth today? My relationship with my father.\\nI mean it, my dad was no joke. My dad did not fuck around. My dad did not trust anybody. My dad did not trust anyone. In fact, he had a saying… but he wouldn’t tell me. What, too clever for you? That joke is fuckin’ amazing. Last year was a sad year for my family. Last year, my mom should’ve been celebrating her 60th birthday. But because of drugs, alcohol and other terrible decisions, we all forgot. It was sad.\\nWhen I was a kid, I used to fantasize about getting older, growing up and having money, and buying my mom nice things for her birthday. When I was a kid, we were poor. So poor I remember, just so I could go to my senior prom, just so I could go to my senior prom, I had to sell my U.S. passport on the street. Sold my passport on the street for 300 bucks to get to go to my prom. Of course this was before 9/11 so… my bad, everybody. Weird joke to clap for, but sure. My mom actually should’ve been on one of the planes that crashed on 9/11. I think.\\nI mean, don’t get me wrong, I loved my mother. She was my mom, of course I loved her. We fought a lot. My mom could be very racist. Very racist. And I do not tolerate racism. That’s ignorance and I hate that. When I was a kid, like nine years old, I’d come home after school. Once in a while, I’d bring a friend over to play with me at my house. Once in a while, I’d bring a black friend over. And when I did that, my mom would act weird. She’d pull me aside and say, “Anthony, who’s your new friend? Is he a drug dealer?” And I would say, “Shut up, Mom, that’s racist. Put your money away.” I never get to see my family anymore, really. Most of them are in jail, to be honest. And we never talk, write letters or any of that shit. ‘Cause they’re all in jail for the exact same thing. My testimony. You. – What’s your name? – Melissa. – Melissa, where you from? – Santa Clara. – What do you do? – I win things on the radio. – You win things on the radio? – Yeah. Follow-up question, how’d you get tic',\n",
       "  'kets to this? Let me ask you this. You ever, uh… you ever find a body in the woods? Ever do that? No? It’s okay. I have. I was walking through the woods one day and… some poor bastard had stepped in a bear trap or something. I never told anybody about it. But I went back there a week later, and he was dead. Yeah. I do crazy shit like that all the time. What can I say? I’m wacky. The other night I was driving my car. I was driving my car and I ran over a deer… a dear, dear friend. I’m torn constantly. At night, I do shows, but during the day, I’ve got a hobby. During the day, I go from town to town… and I shut down the local abortion clinic. You heard me. I shut down abortion clinics everywhere I go. It’s easy for me. I’m charming. I stand outside the front doors all day long and… consistently underbid them. You guys mad about that one? It’s gonna get so much fuckin’ worse. Gotta talk to one more person. You, sir. What’s your name? – Allan. – Allan, where you from? – Frisco. – Frisco. I can tell you’re a local ’cause of how cool you are. What do you do, Frisco? – I fight fires. I fight fires. – You what? You’re a firefighter? Awesome. What do you wanna do? If you could do anything. If you could do any job in the world, what would your dream job be? – Travel the world. – Travel the world. It’s good to have a dream. I hope you go for it. It doesn’t sound like you’re even gonna get close. I think you should do it. Travel the world. Do it.\\nEveryone should try to live their dream, that’s my point. Everyone. I get to live my dream. I mean, not when I’m in San Francisco, but for the most part. Being a comedian was my dream. ‘Cause no one can tell me what to do. That’s all I cared about. Most people don’t ever try to live their dream. Lot of people try and they fail. Which I think is better, more noble, more respectable.\\nI had an uncle. All he ever dreamed about, cared about, talked about… wanted to become an astronaut. Fly into space one day. And he went for it. He went for it. And he failed. He blew it. Ended up becoming one of those pussies… …on the Space Shuttle Challenger. You guys remember that, right? I think it’s funny. I think it’s funny how the things that happen to us when we’re kids end up staying with us for our entire lives. I got this little niece. When she was three years old, she almost drowned. And now to this day, even ten years later, she still will not go anywhere near me. Yeah, I was babysitting her… and trying to do laundry. And she accidentally fell into the washing machine. Thought I was quick. I got good reflexes. I thought I got her out before anyone would find out what happened, but nope. Turned everything pink. You’re gonna find out a lot about yourselves on this next one. Hey, did you guys know… Did you guys know that when a newborn baby… when a newborn baby is first born, when it’s fresh out of the womb… it can actually hear and see everything around it… for up to ten seconds after it’s decapitated? Yeah. Yeah. I never know what to say. I never know what to say to someone after they’ve lost a baby. What do you say to someone after they’ve lost a baby? “Oh, I’m sorry for your loss”? Doesn’t cut it. “Are you gonna be okay?” Not even close. That’s why I just keep my mouth shut. Let my lawyer do the talking. I’m not good with kids. That’s my point. That’s what this whole thing’s about. I’m not good with kids. Not gonna lie. Hell, a couple of months ago, I dropped my cousin’s baby. Flat-out dropped my cousin’s baby on the ground. But I don’t feel like that was my fault. I don’t feel responsible for that one, you know? Who in their right mind… who the hell in their right mind would ever ask me, Anthony Jeselnik, to be a pallbearer? It’s okay, people hate… people hate dead baby jokes. They hate them. They hate them. It’s like, “Anthony, why do you have to tell dead baby jokes? Why do you have so many dead baby jokes?” “No one likes them, why do you insist?” Well, I’ll tell you why. Because dead baby jokes have made me rich. And who was it? Who was it who said the first million is the hardest? Was it Hitler? Didn’t see that one coming, did you? That was a good response. Most audiences just pretend I didn’t say it. But I like it. I like making Hitler jokes. It’s cool for me. I enjoy it. Hell, I lost my grandfather. I lost my grandfather in the Holocaust Museum. It was the Holocaust Museum of Modern Art. Which is just like a normal Holocaust museum, except you walk around all day being like, “Oh! I should have thought of that.” My grandmother died about a year ago. And I didn’t think anything could ever be worse than when my grandmother passed away. But I was wrong. It was fine. The hard part, the upsetting part… was that we thought she died in the way that she wanted. She wanted to die in the best way possible, like uh… You, radio winner. What’s the best way you can die? This is not a trick question. – In your sleep? – Yes, thank you. Thank you, everybody wants to die peacefully in their sleep. Not me. I want to be alert, awake, surrounded by friends, in a house fire. But my grandmother wanted to go peacefully in her sleep. We thought that’s how she went. We were all excited for her. But then we did an autopsy. Found out she actually died horribly, in the worst way possible. During an autopsy. It was fucked up. Yeah. Yeah. She always said her grandkids didn’t pay enough attention to her and… and she was right. She was dead on. But I loved my grandma. Loved her very much. My grandma taught me about a lot. Taught me what religion is. Taught me everything you can know about religion, in one quick story. I’ll tell you now. When I graduated from high school… When I graduated, my grandma came to me, gave me a big hug, said, “Anthony, I’m so proud of you. You’re my first grandchild to get to go to college. What can I do for you, what can I give you before you go to college?” And I said, “Honestly, Grandma, all I need from you is money.” Yeah, I know you guys have never been, but college is expensive. And my grandma said, “Okay, Anthony, I understand.” Couple months go by. It’s the end of summer. I’m packing up my dad’s car, getting ready to go to school, and my grandma walks up. Says, “Anthony, here, before you leave, take this.” And she handed me a brand-new Bible. King James Version. And I said, “Thanks, Grandma, that’s exactly what we talked about.” I got in the car and I went off to school. Couple of weeks go by, I’m hanging out in my dorm room, having a good time, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, just calling to see how college is going.” “Grandma, college is the best. I’m having the time of my life. But to be honest, I’m starting to run low on money, and I could use a little bit, like we talked about.” She said, “Okay, well let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Totally, Grandma, I’m on chapter four.” She said, “Okay, Anthony, I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Hung up the phone. Couple of months go by. Now I’m really starting to struggle financially. Might have to drop out of school, so I call my grandma in a panic. I say, “Please, it’s',\n",
       "  ' Anthony. I’m having the time of my life in college. But if I wanna graduate, and I do, I need you to send me some money like we talked about.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Have you been reading your Bible?” And I said, “Yes, Grandma! I wish it was longer!” And she said, “Okay, Anthony. I guess I’ll talk to you later.” Finally, it’s the end of the school year. I’ve got straight A’s, but I’m dropping out of college, ’cause I have no more money left. And I’m furious, close to tears, cleaning out my dorm room, when the phone rings. It’s my grandma. “Anthony, I heard you’re dropping out of school today. How come?” And I said, “You know goddamn well how come, Grandma! ‘Cause you wouldn’t give me any money.” She said, “Anthony, let me ask you this: Did you read your Bible?” And I just hung up the phone. I was so pissed off. Took everything out of that room. Last thing I took off the shelf, the last thing I took out of that room, was that Bible my grandma had given me. Took it off the shelf, held it in my hands, and for the first time, I actually opened it up. And on the very first page, in my grandmother’s handwriting, it said, “Fuck you.” Thank you everyone. I hope you enjoyed the jokes I prepared for you tonight. And all the jokes I write, they’re all made up, they’re all fake, except for Eric Clapton and the Challenger. Everything else… everything else is fake. But everything I’m about to tell you, from here until the end of the show, that’s all true. Now… I don’t tell dark jokes because I’m a comedian. I’m a comedian because I tell dark jokes. I’m kind of fucked up, all right? I’ve always been this way. I can’t really help myself. It gets me into trouble a lot. I lose friends. It’s ruined relationships with people in my family. For instance, my grandmother actually did pass away, about six months ago. I did love her very much. She was a big fan of mine. And I was asked to speak at her funeral, which was a horrible mistake. Horrible mistake. No one should ever ask me to speak at anyone’s funeral. I asked a friend for advice. Was like, “I’ve never talked to a group of people without getting paid a lot of money. How should I handle this?” “Anthony, just go up there and tell a story. Find one moment about you and your grandma you can share with everybody. And don’t tell a joke. Try not to.” So I walked up and was like, “You know what my favorite memory was? When I was like four years old, before I learned to read, Grandma would curl up with me on the couch, she had this Southern accent, and she would read to me. She would read Mark Twain to me, and I loved it. Like… Mark Twain out of my grandma’s mouth, it would just come to life.” And then I couldn’t help myself. I said, “And I know my grandma loved it too, because it combined her two favorite things: spending time with her grandchildren, and using the ‘N’ word.” Now I promise you… I promise you… until you’ve heard your grandfather gasp at his own wife’s funeral… …at a Methodist Church in Vicksburg, Mississippi… you are not a real comedian. I am a real comedian. I am a pure comedian. I think I’m one of the best comedians of all time. But here’s the thing. It doesn’t matter if you believe me. It really doesn’t matter. The important thing is that I would pass a lie detector test. I like to test myself. I like to test myself by joking about horrible things and nothing but. One of my favorite ways to test myself, I like to joke about tragedies the day that they happen. The day they happen. I don’t believe in too soon. I’m on a tight schedule. And I’m good at it. I’m good at it. Like, the day of… the day of the Aurora, Colorado Batman movie theater shooting. The day it happened, I went online, I went on Twitter, and I tweeted “Other than that, how was the movie?” Right? Right? Nailed it. Nailed it. And the reason I get away with that… the reason I get away with stuff like that is I’m just the guy who does it. People are used to it from me. It would be weird if I didn’t make a joke the day of a tragedy. Which is why I was very surprised when I got in a lot of trouble the day of the Boston Marathon. Now, I don’t follow the news regularly. But I know the second a tragedy happens because I get 25 text messages saying, “Don’t do it.” And whenever I see that… whenever I see that, it makes me sad. It makes me sad ’cause I know something horrible has happened. People will say, “Anthony, what’s funny about Aurora? What’s funny about the Boston Marathon? What’s funny about your grandmother’s funeral?” Nothing! Nothing is funny about those things. That’s where I come in. So I see these texts and I’m like, “Oh, no, what happened?” But I also think, “I’ve got a job to do.” So I go online, I start reading about it. I don’t want to watch the footage. But I’ll read about what happened. And I think, “How can I make someone laugh today?” And then I think, “I got it.” I go back on Twitter. And I tweet, “Guys, today, there are just some lines that should not be crossed.” “Especially the finish line.” And again, I think, “Nailed it. U.S.A.! U.S.A.!” But then my phone starts to ring. And it’s my boss. Or should I say my former boss. And they say, “Anthony, this is unacceptable. You are not just a comedian today. You’re also the host of your own TV show, with your name in the title, on our network. You take this joke down right now or you’re fired.” And I say, “Go fuck yourselves.” And I meant it. I didn’t get into comedy for money or fame. I know that sounds wrong, because I’m dripping with both. I only got into this business so that no one could tell me what to do. And they said… Sure. They said, “Well, Anthony, you don’t understand. You don’t understand at all. If you don’t take this joke down right now, if you don’t delete this joke right now, not only are you fired, but the entire cast and crew of your television show, about a hundred people, they’re also out of a job.” And I’m ashamed to tell you this. I’m embarrassed to admit it. But in that moment, I folded, and I deleted the joke. ‘Cause I’m happy to fight for what I believe in. I’m happy to take the consequences for what I’ve done. But what I could not do, cannot do, is walk up to my cameraman and say, “Hey, buddy, no work for you on Monday. I had this sweet tweet.” Couldn’t do it. But as soon as I hit delete, I got mad and I regretted it. I would fire every single one of those fucking assholes now, I’ll tell ya that. And I got mad for betraying myself and everything I believe in. I’m just as mad today as I was then. Just as mad. So mad, I had to have a meeting with the network, where they called me in for a little lecture. They’re like, “Anthony, we’re family. Why are you so upset? Can’t you see we did you a favor? Don’t you worry about your career?” Let me ask you, San Francisco, do I seem like I worry about my career? No. You know why people who win the lottery always end up going bankrupt? Because if they’re worried about their money, they wouldn’t have played the lottery in the first fuckin’ place. I do not worry about my career. And they said, “Anthony, the problem is when you make a joke on Twitt',\n",
       "  \"er the day of a tragedy, it seems like you’re making fun of the victims, and that’s wrong.” But that’s not what I’m doing. Because, you see, the day of a tragedy, victims are not on Twitter. Am I wrong? Tell me I’m wrong. The day of a tragedy, victims have got victim shit to do. No one is ever… No one is ever putting on a tourniquet, asking, “Hey, are we trending?” No. This is who I’m making fun of when I make a joke on Twitter the day of a tragedy. The people who see something horrible happen in the world and they run to the Internet. And they run to their social media, Facebook, Twitter, whatever they got. And they all write down the exact same thing: “My thoughts and prayers…” “My thoughts and prayers with the people in Aurora.” “My thoughts and prayers with the families in Boston.” Do you know what that’s worth? Fucking nothing. Fucking less than nothing. Less than nothing. You are not giving any of your time, your money or even your compassion. All you are doing, all you are doing, is saying, “Don’t forget about me today.” “Don’t forget about me.” “Lots of crazy distractions in the news, but don’t forget how sad I am.” Those people are worthless and they deserve to be made fun of. They’re like a wedding photographer who only takes selfies. You understand? Now I’m sure everyone here has told a joke before where nobody laughed at it. It’s fine. It’s embarrassing, but it’s fun. You can laugh at yourself. It’s not a reason to stop telling jokes. Maybe some of you have told a joke before where someone got mad at you for it. Trust me, that’s fun too. You guys ever tell a joke and then get death threats? Well, I guess that’s what makes me me. On my television show, I once did a segment that aired once and only once, before it was banned, called “Shark Party.” All right? Now… Some of you enjoyed it, but if you’ve never seen “Shark Party,” you can never see “Shark Party.” It’s been wiped off the face of the earth by the powers that be, so I will explain it to you. I love sharks. I love sharks more than anything. People… People I can barely fucking tolerate. Every single year, 100 million sharks are killed by human beings. Every year, 20, 25 people killed by sharks? So when I hear about a shark attack, I’m like, “Fuck, yeah.” Win one for the home team. So as soon as I get this show where I can do what I want, I say, “You know what? I want to have a shark party. As soon as there’s a shark attack, we’re having a shark party.” And I get lucky. About a month into my run, this guy from New Zealand gets eaten by a great white, the champagne of sharks. And I know exactly what to do. I’ve already got the script written. I walk on stage, in front of the cameras. I say, “Ladies and gentlemen, this guy from New Zealand has been eaten by a great white shark. It’s time for a shark party.” Lights go down, music comes up. Six women wearing shark dresses come out on either side of me, and we all start dancing. For way too long. A stripper wearing a giant shark head runs out and gives me a lap dance. Very tasteful. And then I stand up and we show a giant picture of the guy who got eaten. Which, in retrospect, is where it all went wrong. But I get to say my favorite thing I’ve ever said on television: “Smile, you son of a bitch. Shark party.” And in America, where I’m famous for those types of shenanigans… everybody was like, “Anthony, that was fucked up.” “It was fucked up to see you dance.” End of controversy. However, in New Zealand, where they don’t get my show, they’ve never seen me, and frankly, they don’t get out much… the New Zealand media takes the video… and they show it to the guy’s family. And they say, “What do you guys think about this?” And they say, “Crikey,” or whatever the fuck they say over there. The point is, all of New Zealand, all of New Zealand rises up against me. All 45 of those cunts rise up. And start threatening my life. Now, I don’t read the things that people write about me on the Internet. But I pay people who do. And they come to me, and they’re like, “We’ve got some terrible news. Please sit down.” They say, “You are getting a lot of death threats online from New Zealand because of ‘Shark Party.'” And I was like, “Really? New Zealand wants to kill me? That’s weird because they didn’t even kill the shark.” I said, “How many death threats am I getting?” And they were like “Oh, all of them. You are getting all of the death threats. What do you want us to do? We can send someone to talk to them. Extra security? What do you want?” I said, “No, forget about it. Leave it alone, don’t worry.” This might be hard for some to understand. I’ve said it several times tonight. Everyone is going to die. I know full well I am going to die. And most of us don’t get to choose how we check out. But if I die because someone murders me over one of my jokes? Best case scenario. If somebody murders me over one of my jokes, I immediately become a legend. I’m a comedy God. The Mount Rushmore of comedy is me, four times. I said, “Come on then.” My security guys are like, “Okay, Anthony, well, just so you know, that is the dumbest thing we’ve ever heard.” “But you’re the boss. Okay.” And they leave. And then the next day they come back. And they say “Anthony, sorry to bother you again. I know you didn’t care yesterday, but it’s gotten much worse. You’re gonna wanna hear this.” They say, “Someone from New Zealand tracked down your mom and dad’s phone number and address in Pittsburgh, posted that online… and now your entire family is getting death threats from New Zealand.” And I have to admit, that had never occurred to me before. It never crossed my mind… that my family, my loved ones, would ever pay the price, be caught in harm’s way, for something I’ve done or I’ve joked about. And honestly, I would cut my throat for my jokes. I would give my life for what I do. But if anyone, and I mean this for a fact, if anyone ever hurt my family or killed someone I cared about because of a joke I’ve made? Even better. This man is fantastic\\nI watched the show 10 times  and I laughed so much everytime Except for the Eric Clapton joke and Sharky Party all is forgivable.  Great material. So a joke about a guy who runs a camp for molesting kids is okay but a joke about a famous musician’s son falling to his death isn’t?  Where are your priorities? They’re just jokes.

       " ['Beth Stelling’s stand-up comedy special, “If You Didn’t Want Me Then,” was recorded at the Victoria Theatre in Dayton, Ohio, which is her hometown. The show was released on Netflix on October 3, 2023. “If You Didn’t Want Me Then” is a hilarious exploration of relationships, self-discovery, and the absurdities of life. Beth brings her signature style to the stage, delivering a performance that is both deeply personal and universally relatable. * * * [loud bang] [rock music playing] [crowd cheering] [mouthing] Thank you, guys. What’s up, Dayton? Thank you. [rock music ends] [sucks teeth] I’m gonna set up my little office here. I’m gonna need these glasses later. My… My vision is declining rapidly. [crowd laughs] Anybody else feel like they’ve been aging in dog years? [crowd laughs] Everything to me looks like, you know, those public park restroom mirrors that are just a buffed sheet of metal? [crowd laughs] [exhales sharply] I’m getting ready like, “I’m seeing a general outline here.” [groans] “That’ll do.” [crowd laughs] I have a whole new appreciation for my teachers in their sixties growing up, who always had, like, mascara right here… [laughs] …and a buzz cut situation. [laughs] I mean, I get it. Work smarter, not harder. [crowd laughs] And now is also the perfect time to announce I plan to age. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Thank you. [crowd cheering, applauding] Naturally, ideally from the comfort of my own home. Somebody’s got to do it. We need a control group in Los Angeles. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] Otherwise, we won’t know what old ladies look like. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] So I volunteer. [crowd laughs] If I do get surgery, it’s going to be a lobotomy. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] [inhales] My friend Monica wants one too, and I just told her, “Fuck it, let’s get our heads done!” [crowd laughs] Let’s get our heads done. [crowd laughs] I ran that joke by my mom first, and… [laughs] …her response was, “Wouldn’t that be nice?” [crowd laughs, applauds] [chuckling] Curveball Diane. [scoffs] [inhales deeply] The pandemic was rough on us all. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I used to be able to shock her. [laughs] Not anymore. I’m very grateful for my mom. She raised me and my two older sisters, who I’m very close with. I met them through my mom in the late ’80s, and… we’ve remained close. My mom’s cool. She absolutely loves the Olympics. She’s obsessed. Huge o-head. Her words. [crowd laughs] She’s also pretty big fan of me. You know, she won’t stop texting. And… [crowd laughs] She likes to hype me up, you know, before shows. And one time, before a show, she said to me, “Bethy, you are so good at stand-up comedy.” “If it were an Olympic event… [crowd laughs] …you would win gold in the women’s stand-up comedy.” [crowd laughs, applauds] [cheering] She did raise us right here in Dayton, Ohio. [crowd cheering] [Beth] Mmm. I knew you guys would be happy for me. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] Not everybody shows us the respect we deserve. You know, we’re the birthplace of aviation. [crowd cheering] Yeah. North Carolina has been coming for us for years. [crowd laughs] Their license plates say, “first in flight.” [scoffs] It’s like, “Okay.” [crowd laughs] It was built in Dayton. We just used you for your wind. [crowd laughs, applauds] [crowd cheering] [Beth chuckling] The flights were short. They meant nothing to them! Shitty hawk. [crowd laughs, applauds] [Beth chuckling] My passions have changed since you saw me last. [scoffs] I’m very into aviation now. [crowd laughs] Nah. We all spent the last couple of years differently. Me personally, I searched the Wright brothers on the internet a couple times. [chuckles] Just to learn about my heritage, the city I come from. [sucks teeth] It’s funny how our whole motto is based upon two men who literally wanted to fly away. [laughs] And they couldn’t. [crowd laughs] [laughs, sighs] [crowd applauds, cheers] Nonetheless, back in 1892, Wilbur and Orville, they had a bike shop. They were old before they flew. [crowd laughs] I thought they did popcorn for a bit, but that is Redenbacher. [crowd laughs loudly] Now, you can still go visit it, the original bike shop… The first one has been torn down, as I’m sure everybody here knows. Uh… [chuckles] I believe there’s a credit union or something, but you can still visit the fourth one over… over on Williams. You can poke your head in there, yeah, see all the photos of… of Wilbur and Orville working on the bikes. And there’s another dude in there helping them. There’s no ladies working at the bike shop. [clicking tongue] [crowd laughs] If they let us in there, we would have gotten to Peloton much faster. [crowd laughing, cheering] And the seats would have been more comfortable too. [crowd laughs] No, I realize it’s… it’s silly to get your tail in a knot over firsts. Like, he was first to do something, because I guess you got to ask, “Were you first, or were you the only one allowed to do it?” [chuckles] [crowd laughs] He was that one. [chuckles] [crowd cheering] I’m scratchy. This is Sleepytime tea. [laughs] [crowd laughs] [chuckles] I’m just, like… [snores] My, um… [smacks lips] …my mom is a pianist, which was funny for a while. [crowd laughs] She taught elementary school music, uh, for 34 years, and I would… I grew up going to visit her classroom even into college. And one time I was visiting her class. She had a second grade group in there. And she was teaching them that song, one, two, buckle, my shoe, three four shut the… You know, classic. [crowd laughs] She has all the kids in a circle. Circles are huge in the music industry. [crowd laughs] And she’s having them finish, you know, like one, two, three, four, five, six. She gets to nine, ten, and she points to this little second grade boy. She says, “Nine, ten,” and he goes, “Big fat asshole.” [laughs] [crowd laughs] I literally had to steady myself on the door frame. I was laughing so hard. My mom was like, “Jonathan, you go sit by the door!” [chuckles] I was like, “Not over here. He’s killing.” [Beth laughs] Nine, ten, big fat asshole? [laughing] It doesn’t even rhyme. [grunting] This kid’s a genius. What, was he just saving it up all day for Diane’s class? Knowing that the worst that would happen to him was like, “Jonathan, you go sit by the door.” “You’re too young to be alone in the hallway, but you’re out of the circle!” [crowd laughs] [laughing] I don’t even know how old second grade is. Nobody tell me. [crowd chuckles] I was like, “Where did he get that?” “Was it a dare?” I personally like to think he probably heard it at home, or some version of it. [laughs] But I have a wild imagination, so. I like to think it was probably his mom… [chuckles] [crowd laughing] …saying it to his dad. [chuckles] “You’ve been gone from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m., you big fat asshole!” [crowd laughing] “I could use a little help.” “Especially from five to six, when you’re probably out sucking dicks!” [crowd laughing] “Try to come home again at 3 or 4.” “I’m going to shut the door in your big fat asshole face!” [crowd laughs, applauds] “Oh, Jonathan, I’m sorry you had to see that.” [crowd laughs] [sighs] That is his real name. I… [crowd laughs] I’ve left it his real name in case he needs to find me, uh… [crowd laughs] [Beth chuckles] I wanna know the truth. He should be making his way to the stand-up scene any day now, and… I’ll ask him myself. [crowd chuckles] She also did the high school chorus, and that was after school. So I’d go over there, so I wouldn’t have to have a babysitter. And she would have the chorus up on the risers. And I would be in the aisles doing cartwheels and back walkovers, some splits and stuff, trying to get the high school boys’ attention. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I had crushes on all of them. They were up here, singing their hearts out. It was hot. [crowd laughs] And I don’t know, I was probably in, like, third or fourth grade. You’re a gymnast when you’re young because you’re unaware of the many ways that your neck can break. [crowd laughs] And there’s a lot of benefits to being a gymnast. You know, you’re strong, you’re flexible, the leotards and stuff. [inhales] My mom used to describe my legs as tree trunks, which I tried to explain was damaging, but… now I love it, you know? You could parkour off these babies. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I’m probably going to end up doing a… [sucks teeth] …open-leg casket. [crowd laughs] So… chorus is up here. I’m in the aisles. I have a huge crush on this baritone named Tim. And my mom makes the mistake of letting Tim babysit for me. Very dangerous. [crowd laughs] For him. My love language is sexual harassment. [chuckles] [crowd laughs loudly] Most of the time he spent babysitting, he was stiff-arming the top of my head. Like… [chuckles] While I was like… [roaring] [chuckling] Like this, trying to touch his junk. [crowd laughs] We were an all-female household. I had curiosities. [sucks teeth] But Tim… Tim was very good to me, uh… He took me to the gas station to get candy. Um, he got me a stuffed elephant one year for my birthday. Point is, good guy. [man laughs] And then more… It',\n",
       "  ' could have been his laugh. [crowd laughs] Recently, I actually ran into Tim at the grocery store, at Dorothy Lane Market. [crowd cheering] [laughs] Some fans of the Killer Brownie. [crowd laughs] So, Tim and I were catching up, and he’s like, “Bee, oh my gosh, it’s been ages.” And we were talking and chatting. And he was like, “Oh my gosh, I’m so happy for everything that you’re up to.” And then Tim asked me out on a date. [crowd cheers] Thank you. [crowd laughs] And I just looked at him and I said… [chuckling] “If you didn’t want me then…” [crowd laughing] [chuckling] Bit of a pedophile joke. I think it was fun. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] You have to be careful with pedophilia because you can catch it just by touching a kid. [chuckles] It’s… [crowd laughs] [chuckling] [crowd applauds] [inhales deeply] Mmm. So, we had guinea pigs growing up, and we kept them in our garage. And in the hot Ohio summers, they absolutely died in there. [crowd laughs] And my sister reminded me… [chuckles] …we named one of the pigs Brownie, which, in retrospect, is extra sad. She was out there straight baking at 375. [crowd laughs] [sucks teeth] And my mom felt awful, okay? So she let us give him a proper burial in the backyard. And me and my sisters took those hard-bodied pigs… Not like ripped, but rigor mortis hard. And… we buried them in the easiest place to dig. We put them right in the sandbox. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Then a couple of neighborhood dogs came along… [snores] …snarfed them right up. [chuckling] It was a tragedy all around, and I really feel like it could have been avoided if we just had a dad. [chuckles] [crowd laughing] I don’t know what dads do. But I assume it’s regulate the garage temp. [crowd laughs] They’re always in there tinkering around, planning their escape. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] No, my dad didn’t escape as much as he was asked to leave. [chuckles] Escorted off the premises. [crowd laughs] Some of you know this about my… my dad. When I was little, he moved down to Orlando, Florida, to become an actor, which is not where you go. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] He did land a few gigs. Uh, he… he was an extra in the television series of Swamp Thing. Uh, he was a truck driver in that. And… that’s it. Um… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Then he took things into his own hands, started his own business, and now he’s in the sign spinning biz. He calls it live roadside commercials, or… or character directionals. He likes to devise a character and then present it to the cars. Um… [crowd laughs] He’s a leprechaun in front of this Irish pub called the Kerryman, for example, and the rest of his characters are available on his website. [crowd laughs] [sucks teeth] So, we grew up around a lot of costumes, like thrifting and going to Ray’s Circus of Value and stuff. For example, he loves a morphsuit. You know what those are? [man] No. [woman] Yeah. It’s like what Olympic speed skaters wear, but there’s no hole cut for your face. [crowd laughs] So you’re just in a single Lycra suit, just one color head to toe, no skin’s showing. He wears an orange one in front of the Orange Julius. [crowd laughs] I don’t know how the silhouette of my dad’s penis sells smoothies, but… [chuckles] That was a bit of a tongue twister. I really got through it. “Silhouette of my dad’s penis sells smoothies.” [crowd laughs] He heard me say that, and he was like, “I wear shorts over it. I’m family-friendly.” [chuckles] All right. [Beth chuckling] It doesn’t rain that often in Orlando, and he called me one time after a shift. He said, “There was a sudden downpour, and I almost waterboarded myself.” “I was like…” [panting] “…I couldn’t breathe.” “It was stuck to my face. My fingers were covered.” “The zipper’s on the back of my head. I nearly died.” [crowd laughs] “I had to get into the car. I was so embarrassed.” [chuckles] I was like, “It’s only embarrassing when it’s wet?” [crowd laughs] [Beth chuckles] Anyway, he made it out. So, my sisters and I would have to leave our mom here in Dayton and go visit our dad as kids in Orlando because it was court-ordered. And… [chuckles] …we didn’t have a ton to do down there, uh, because we didn’t go to school, so we, like, couldn’t make friends, and all the neighbors were… old or from Florida. Uh… [laughs] [crowd laughs] So we did a lot of playing in the costumes. And there were a ton of them. The garage was wall-to-wall filled with costumes. Sometimes, we would find strangers in there. [crowd laughs] Because they thought it was a garage sale. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] So, one night, it was just me and my oldest sister, Meghan, we’re playing in the costumes, doing a photo shoot. [inhales] I put on, um, this, like, muscle tee. You know what I mean? A muscle tee, but then there’s huge latex muscles that you put your arms through. And then a brown curly wig, and, um, it just wasn’t working for me. I was like, “What’s my motivation?” You know? So… Then Meghan put on this, like, gray pinstripe suit, a Dick Tracy hat, and some wingtip shoes. And she… It was really working for her. Uh, she was feeling herself. And so I decided to go with something fresh, unopened. I went and put on this full red lace bodysuit. And then we whipped up the tunes, we were dancing around. Meghan is, like, six years older than me. We’re dancing. I do a high kick, and Meghan goes, “Oh my God, Beth!” [inhales] “There’s a hole in the crotch of that.” [crowd laughs] [exhales sharply] I was like, “Cool!” [crowd laughs] “So you can pee?” [chuckling] She was like, “Um, yeah, take it off right now.” [crowd laughing] [chuckles] I was just a sixth grader in a sex suit. Then… [chuckles] This is when my dad comes in. I believe we were told to be quiet. And… He’s… He pokes his head in. He’s like, “Girls, get out here. You’re gonna want to see this.” And we were like, “Do we want to see what’s in your backyard at midnight in Orlando, Florida?” What we didn’t expect to see were just 18 raccoons eating out of a huge trough of dog food that he provided them. [crowd laughs] He goes, “I threw in some Hershey Kisses.” [chuckles] “Even raccoons deserve dessert.” [chuckles] I was like, “That I agree with, honestly.” “Everybody deserves dessert. Otherwise, this is disgusting.” He said, “Don’t worry, Bee.” “Every night, after they’re done eating, I bleach the deck.” [chuckling] “What?” “You’re telling me you’ve created for yourself a 12 a.m. to 2 a.m. unpaid raccoon internship?” [crowd laughs] “Take back your life, man.” As you can imagine, over the years, the numbers skyrocketed exponentially. He was helping rodents flourish in the back. He told me recently they’re actually mammals from the weasel family. [chuckles] Well, I thought the highest the number got was 73. But he FaceTimed me a couple of weeks ago. I didn’t pick up, and… [chuckles] …if I don’t pick up, he’ll text right away. He’s like, “Beth, this is your dad.” [chuckles] So our whole text thread is just like, “Beth, this is your dad.” “Beth, this is your dad.” “Beth, this is your dad.” [laughs] Which seems weird, but, like, he’s right. I never save his number. So, it’s good. [crowd laughs] [smacks lips] But he told me that the highest it actually got was 91. Ninety-one raccoons. But back when it was still in the forties, um… my sister decided to calculate how much he was spending on dog food per year, because she was hoping to go to college, and… [crowd laughs] [smacks lips] …apparently he was spending $4,000 a year on dog food. Didn’t calculate the Hershey Kisses. Apparently those are marginal. [crowd chuckles] He goes, “I know it’s a problem.” “But on the off nights I don’t feed ’em, they take their long skinny fingers, they pick up rocks from the rock garden, and they roll them up and down against my bedroom window until I come out and feed ’em.” [silent scream] [chuckling] “What?” [chuckles] “Call an exterminator immediately!” But I just didn’t think about what the phone call would be like for him. Just like, “Yeah, we got a little bit of a raccoon problem on our hands.” “How many?” [sucks teeth] “Exactly 91.” [crowd laughing] “Do you need their names or… No? Okay.” “How did it happen?” “Whoo! My goodness.” “I got to tell you, uh, direct result of my actions.” [crowd laughs] So, it’s like far too expensive to exterminate. So… And plus, it would be a literal genocide. I… [laughs] Ninety-one raccoon carcasses. It’s like up to here. So… he decides to go with trapping and releasing into the wild. He bought two traps, but they were expensive. So he made one of his own, which I imagine was just a piece of fruit in his mouth, and his open arms. Like… [crowd laughing, applauding] [laughing] He was taking them one by one. [chuckles] He was releasing them into the wild. He was very proud because it took so long, so he liked to update me. He’s like, “So far, I’ve got 39 raccoons, two possums, and a black cat.” [crowd laughing] “There’s still a bunch of them out there. Biguns.” He was taking them in his car. He drives a Geo, which is essentially a roller skate. [crowd laughing] And… he was putting a blanket over the cage. I was like, “So',\n",
       "  \" they can’t find their way back or…” He’s like, “I didn’t want them to get rattled.” He’s like, “But still, they poke their fingers through the blanket, and they sound like Halloween.” [crowd laughing] [scoffs] I don’t know if I’ve painted a good picture of my father thus far, but… [crowd laughs loudly] …this is the same man who visited me in Chicago once, when I was living there, and he described riding the L train “like Jurassic Park.” [chuckles] So I have no clue what he’s talking about when he says “they sound like Halloween.” Whether it’s like… [mimics suspenseful music] Like one of those ghosts you walk by at CVS. It’s like… [mimics a ghost moaning] [laughs, sighs] He’s like, “Did I tell you one of them got out in the car?” [crowd laughing] I was like, “No, but it sounds like you do want to tell me.” He’s like, “Thankfully, I was just outside the driveway, so I open the back hatch, it hissed at me, and I drove off.” [chuckles] I was like, “Been there.” [crowd laughs] He was taking… When he said “releasing them into the wild,” I thought he was taking them to his neighbors’ trash cans. Like, “One for you. One for you. One for you.” But on that FaceTime… I did call him back, and he told me, “Listen. News developed.” He said, uh, “Under the cover of night, I’ve been taking them over to the Kerryman because there’s a fresh water source.” Now, if you recall, the Kerryman is where my dad is a leprechaun in front of. So… [chuckles] …he just increased his job description to, like, “Get in here for the lunch deals, and don’t look at all these raccoons I dropped off.” [crowd laughs] So he goes, “I finally got down to the lead raccoon.” “And I walked him over there. I put his cage down in the grass, and I just was standing there in my swim trunks.” [chuckling] I was like, “Were you baptizing them before they left?” [crowd laughs] He’s like, “And Snorkie walked right out of his cage.” “They don’t always do.” “And he walked over to me, and with his bare hand…” [laughing] I’m like, “What else would it be?” [crowd laughs] Were you putting them in little outfits? “I’m gonna need the gloves back, my guy.” “And the top hat as well. Yeah.” “Thank you so much. Keep the cane. You’re gonna need it.” He goes, “Snorkie walked over to me, and with his bare hand, he went like this on my crock.” [crowd laughing] “As if to say, ‘Thank you.'” [chuckles] I was like, “Yeah, or as if to be like, ‘Here’s rabies, bitch.'” [crowd laughs] “Thanks for ruining me and my closest 90 relatives’ lives.” “You know what doesn’t grow out here? Dog food and Hershey Kisses.” “We’re f’ed!” “Take me back.” [laughs] [crowd laughs] Only difference between me and the raccoons is I’ve never been on a Christmas card. Uh… [laughs] [crowd laughs] I’m fine with it. I’m at peace. [chuckles] I always liked spending Christmas here better. It always feels weird to have a warm Christmas. I also feel like, because I grew up here in Dayton, I got most of my alcohol drinking out of the way in eighth grade. [crowd laughs] And then, by the time high school rolled around, I was pretty grizzled, you know? [chuckles] “I gotta get my shit together.” [crowd laughing, applauding] Who else is going to lead this field hockey team to State for the first time in 15 years? [crowd cheering] For those of you, uh, that don’t know, field hockey is a sport, and… [crowd laughing] …you play it with a stick and… and a ball. People used to call us “Chicks with Sticks…” [chuckles] …and then inevitably “Chicks with Dicks.” It’s like, “Who would want to get penetrated by a long wooden stick when I have a perfectly good mouth and finger?” No, I’m just kidding. I… [laughs] No, I’ve actually… I’ve never… or I should say, I haven’t yet gone down on a woman. Um… I have had a man go down on me so badly, I’ve thought, like, “Let me down there.” [chuckles] [inhales] “Just to see.” [chuckles, inhales] “It can’t be that hard.” [chuckles] Especially if you love her. Okay. Back to my eighth grade drinking problem. [crowd laughs, applauds] [laughs, sighs] We would, uh… We would sleep over at Mary’s house, and we would sneak out around midnight, cross Irving into the University of Dayton.[crowd cheers] Well, you might want to wait. Uh… [crowd laughs] [laughs] We would wander into a frat house, get hammered, and then some of my girlfriends would hook up with the frat dudes. See? [laughs] A little rugged to think about college dudes hooking up with eighth grade girls. [chuckles] I feel like the only time men believe women is when we’re lying about being 18. [laughs] [crowd laughs] [Beth sighs loudly] [crowd cheering, applauding] [laughs] Frat dudes are like, “What am I supposed to do? Check her ID?” I’m like, “Check… [hesitates] …check her face.” [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Is it underdeveloped and over-contoured? Does it look like she still believes in Santa? [laughs] Are her teeth still white? Behind the braces. [crowd laughs] Naturally, that night, in eighth grade, me and my girlfriends were arrested… [chuckles] …for being too young and hot. [crowd laughs] Well, that was a body roll for anybody who forgot eighth grade. [laughs] I used to practice the body roll in the mirror before dances. I’d be like… [groaning] “Yes!” Sometimes, I’d really kick an arm out to really get it going. [chuckling] Get out there and make some boys cream their khakis. [crowd laughs] Okay, honestly, I had no clue what I was doing, for the record. I had no clue I was making you guys tuck your boners up in your waist pants. [crowd laughs loudly] Just one lift of the shirt, I could have looked it directly in the eye, like… [shouts] [crowd laughing] Late apology from me. I’m sorry. I’ll type it up in the notes app. Post it later. [sucks teeth] But it was campus police who got us. So there was a cop car ride, but… but no cuffs. And then they took us back to the stesh very late at night and put us in a badly lit conference room, where they made us wait it out. And we were scared. [crowd laughs] And then, finally, a cop came in, and he picked up the phone book, and he slammed it down on the table, and he said, “Call your parents.” [scoffs] I was like, “I know the number.” [crowd laughs] [laughing] [crowd cheering] “Call your parents?” “I only have a mom! Why do you think I’m down here?” [crowd laughs] She did pick me up. Uh… Not very pleased with it, but… She… she said, “Something bad could’ve happened to you.” “They could’ve taken advantage of you. I’m just glad you’re okay.” I was like, “I’ve got no tits.” [crowd laughs] She said, “But you have an excellent personality.” [crowd laughs, applauds] “Now get in the van!” [laughs] What if my mom was like, “Now get in the van!” “We’re driving you right back to Sigma Chi, and we’re going to get you one of those frat dudes!” [laughs] I did drive home though, actually. Um, after the pandemonium dust settled, I drove from California to Ohio. I just wanted, like, to feel in charge instead of flying, you know? And my mom was very worried about me driving alone, cross-country. I mean, I was worried about me. I tinted my windows, I bought a knife. But… there’s other things to worry about besides being the hottest person at a rest stop. [crowd laughing] [laughs] For example, um, yeah, if you are traveling alone, hot tip. If someone suspect starts swiftly walking towards you, you can just say, “I’ve actually already been raped. Thank you so much.” [laughs] “I’m good. Thank you.” And men hate to be second, so they’re, “Thank you for letting me know.” [crowd laughing] And then they’re out of there. I also went camping one of the nights, alone. I went camping in Zion National Park. It was the summer everybody was disappearing. And I was like, “Let’s give it a whirl.” [crowd laughs] I’m not even a huge camper.per. I just… I feel like it’s a good thing to do, to try, you know, at least once, alone, especially if you go into it with the perspective of, like, this is what it’s like to be a woman in the world, especially at night, because you can’t lock a tent flap. If you know what I mean. [chuckles] [crowd chuckles] [sucks teeth] If I would, I could. Uh… So I’m in my tent. Night has fallen. I have barricaded the flap as best I can. [crowd laughs] And I heard, like, the snap of a branch, and I grew scared. And that is when I decided to be two people. And I did the voices of two people within my tent. [crowd cheering] [laughing] And what we discovered there is… [laughing] …when I have every opportunity in the world in front of me, my husband is so mean to me. [laughing] [sighs] I was like, “Goodnight, honey.” And he said, “You go to bed!” [crowd laughs] “But first, you suck my dick!” [crowd laughs] [inhales deeply, scoffs] I was like, “Okay.” “At least I’m not alone right now!” [crowd laughing] I made the campers around me fall asleep to the sounds of me choking. [laughs] Just to keep it realistic. I did open with one bark up top. [mimics zip up] Directly into the tip. Just… I always do it just to show it who’s boss. [crowd laughs] [laughing] Other than that, I’m not much of a risk-taker. Uh… I don’t gamble. I would never bungee jump or… \",\n",
       "  'or get married. I… [chuckles] If I had to choose any of those risks… [sucks teeth] …I’m probably gonna bungee. [crowd laughs] I’m gonna bungee it. I got to figure like a grouping of synthetic fibers has to be stronger than two people making a promise. [laughing] [inhales deeply] Eh… And plus it’s, you know, it’s easier to bounce back from. I… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Of all the messaging I’ve received as a gal in this world, I do feel most at peace with my decision not to wed. Sometimes it’s hard to separate messaging from what you really want. And other times your body will kick in, you know. Like, I might still want kids. I just know I won’t have time to come home and let them out. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] It’s something you got to consider, uh, before you get into the kid biz. Me and my boyfriend, we’re actually trying and trying and trying, but I’m on birth control. And… [chuckles] [crowd laughs] [inhales] …it makes it difficult, uh, to conceive. Over the years, I have experimented recreationally with all different forms of birth control. And the first one I got into was, um, was the IUD. I had that for, like, eight years, and I got so much done. And… I remember when I got the second one inserted, the nurse asked me, she said, “Your uterus is tilted backwards.” “Did you know that?” And I remember thinking, “Don’t know how I could.” [chuckles] “But what you’re telling me is even my uterus is like…” “Mm-mm.” [chuckles] [crowd laughs] “We’re good.” And then, more recently, I had to get an ultrasound, and I found out I actually have a bicornate uterus, which means my uterus is like heart-shaped, which is pretty on brand for me. [crowd laughs] But what it meant was, uh, the IUD… This is, um, my impression of an IUD. [smacks lips] It was in there, bopping him on the head or whatever it’s doing. [groans] [crowd laughs] And… some of them could have, you know, swam around and then gotten in trouble up in these parts. So, point being, that was not the right form of birth control for my body. So in my thirties, I started taking the pill, just ’cause I wanted to know what it would be like to be a different person. [crowd laughs, applauds] And we found out. Uh… They started me on Yaz. Has anybody here tried or tasted Yaz? [crowd laughs] You have. Are you still on it, or…? [woman] No. No. You got Yazzed. [crowd laughs] I would describe it as psychological warfare. Uh… They really don’t want us to be in charge. [chuckles] Like, “If you’re not gonna have kids to keep you at home, this will, you crazy bitch.” [crowd laughs] [laughing] [crowd applauding, cheering] Does anybody want… No pressure. Does anybody want to share why they stopped taking Yaz, or…? I just like to open the floor in case anybody needs to, um, get something off their chest, um, or, you know, if you’re with somebody you took it for and want them to know what you went through. [crowd laughs] Depression? Rock on. [laughs] Add it to the fun list. Anybody? Again, no presh. This is for you. [crowd laughs] I’ve done all my research. I’ll go. Um… [crowd laughs loudly] I feel like being on that birth control… [woman] Multiple personalities! Oh, and she’s a little late, that one. [crowd laughs] [Beth laughing] We’re glad you’re both here. [crowd laughs, applauds] [laughing] [crowd cheering] [sighs] No, but I do feel like being on that birth control is the closest my boyfriend will get to a threesome. Just like, “me and me!” [crowd laughs] [laughing] I still keep three extra months of it in my purse. Uh… [chuckles] Just in case I need to… lift a car. Uh… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Or I meet another person that wants to… [whispers] “…start a fire.” [crowd laughing] I did have… I will say we did have some fun with that birth control, because we’d do some birth control bits, my boyfriend and I, you know, like rough stuff. Uh… ‘Cause I would take it… I would take it before bed. Um, and so I’d be sitting across the bed from him in our matching morphsuits with the hole cut out, and… [crowd laughs] I would say to him, “Thank you for reminding me to take the pill.” He didn’t, but I like to put that on him. [chuckles] And then I would take the pill, and he’d make me lift up my tongue to make sure I swallowed it, like… [crowd laughs] And then we would do tasting notes with the birth control. Because he considers himself a bit of a sommelier, so. He’d say, “What are some of the flavor profiles you’re getting from that? I’m a sommelier.” And I’d say, “Um, I’m getting, like, salty tears.” [crowd laughing] “And jealousy.” And then he’d feel bad and give me a kiss. And I’d be like, “Um, it’s so powerful. Any residual flavor profile for you?” And he was like… [sucks teeth] “Total peace and freedom.” [laughs] [laughing maniacally] “Night, night!” [crowd laughing] So after that, they did switch me, uh, to other birth control. [chuckling] I switched to Larin Fe which is generic for low estrogen. Not sponsored. I don’t know why I got so specific. [chuckles] I wish. Can you imagine if I was sponsored by Larin Fe? [chuckles] They just reached out on Instagram. They’re like, “Hey, what’s up?” “We saw you made the switch.” [crowd laughs] “Curious if you could do a quick promo bit for us.” I’d say, “Sure.” And they’d say, “Action!” I’d just be like, “Um…” “It’s like a little bit better. I don’t know.” [pretends to sob] [crowd laughs] [moans] “Should I read the side effects? Or…” They’re like, “Please don’t do that!” I’d be like, “That’s weird, ’cause I actually… always have the side effects printed out with me at all times.” [crowd laughs] “The, uh, side effects of Larin Fe are nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, bloating, spotting, changes in menstrual flow, nipple discharge.” [laughs] “Not yet, but here it comes.” [crowd laughs] [chuckling] “Breast tenderness, breast enlargement, changes in weight, rash, depression, sleep problems, weakness, tired feeling, mood changes, yeast infection.” I guess we’re starting to see why nobody wanted to yell anything out. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] Somebody’s here on a first date, and they’re like, “Yeast infection!” “Today, tomorrow, and every night, baby!” [laughs] Their date is like, “That’s why you’re shifting around in your chair.” [crowd laughs] I actually do have a, um, a yeast infection joke that I can never really find a home for, but… [laughs] This does feel like a good spot for it. And… I did hear a chant from the back that was like, “Tell it. Tell it. Tell…” [inhales deeply] Thank you. So the yeast infection joke goes like this. I won’t know that you’re cheating on me, but my hoot will, because it turns into, like, an old southern chef that’s like, “I knew you were having guests, so I baked something.” [crowd laughing] [inhales] [crowd applauding] [crowd cheering] [Beth laughs, sighs] [sucks teeth] “Swelling. [crowd laughs] Freckles or dark patches of skin on the face.” The “or” is troubling. Uh… [chuckles] One of those is way worse. [crowd laughs] Can you imagine starting at the same time as your friend? You guys get together for lunch. You’re like, “What’d you get, freckles or dark patches?” [chuckles] “Oh man, I got dark patches.” [laughing] The last one’s migraine. Larin Fe is like… [chuckles] The birth control company is like, “Could you put a spin on that or something?” I’d be like, “All I heard was breast enlargement!” [mimics horn blaring] [laughing] [sighs] I didn’t have boobs for the longest time. Aforementioned, I was a gymnast. Side packs for ages. I was ripped as a child. And when you don’t have boobs as a kid, you really want ’em because we’re taught that they’re our worth, and… I do remember, um, wearing a padded swimsuit at the… at the pool. The trouble with that is when you get out of the pool, there’s, like, just two waterfalls dripping underneath. [laughs] The good thing was I was strong enough that I was able to pull myself out of the pool and, at the same time, squeegee my tits out, and then head to the snack bar, get a frozen Snickers, whatever you want to break a tooth on. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] But by the time junior high came, I couldn’t just show up empty-chested. How was I going to get a dude back to my mom’s unfurnished basement? [chuckling] So I had to act fast. I went up to my mom’s room. I stole her water bra, which Victoria’s Secret stole from a hose and water balloons. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] And then just charged us fifty bucks, and we were like, “Honestly, we’ll do anything.” So I strapped on the water bra, I marched to junior high, and it worked. I snagged a teen. I was also a teen at the time, just to be clear. [crowd laughs] I got him back to my mom’s unfurnished basement, popped in the Billy Elliot VHS, which was my fuck tape. I… [crowd laughs] [laughs] I still don’t know how that movie ends. And the water bra made me inadvertently celibate. ‘Cause I wanted to be touched, but I couldn’t let him touch or put any sort of, like, weight upon it, because it made a strange like… [mimics water creaking] …sound that I could not explain. And I also couldn’t do a sneaky release underneath my shirt and chuck it far away, ’cause it was',\n",
       "  ' like the weight of an X-ray vest. [crowd laughing] It was like, “Fuck.” [chuckles] And after that, I would have had no choice but to be like… [gasps] “Ta-da!” [chuckles] “I made my boobs disappear!” [crowd laughs] “And now, for my assistant, my mom taking the towels out of the dryer.” [crowd laughs] And magic is not hot, you know, it never will be. It’s a trick. A guy wants boobs, and he gets water. Not cool. [crowd chuckles] I feel like the only time that would work is if the… if it was like reversed or something. Like, you were running a marathon, and I was volunteering on the side with the water. And you came up for the water, and I was like, [whispers] “Or you can touch my tits.” [crowd laughs] Like, “Oh my God. Thank you so much. I know there’s water up here.” “I don’t know when there’s gonna be tits again. Thank you.” [laughs] That was the longest I’ve run in a while. Um… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] The last time I went running was through the airport, and it tasted like coins in the back of my mouth. [chuckling] Just a little bullet back there. I didn’t grow my boobs until college, and it was with ice cream. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] And since then I’ve gained and lost weight so many times over the years, my boobs are like an atheist dad at Catholic mass who’s just like, “I’m not going to get up again.” [chuckles] “This is insane!” [crowd laughing] [sucks teeth] Okay. Hu… huge news. [laughs] Okay, it’s not that big news. No, huge news. I got a king-sized bed. Thank you so much. Thank you. [crowd cheering] Things are going well. Yeah. I got a king-sized bed, and I started hooking up with this 6-foot-6 football player dude. And I’m just like… [laughs] …if you build it… [chuckles] [crowd laughs] …they will come. At the time, I was hooking up with a smaller gentleman. And I don’t know if you’ve ever done the back and forth between sizes of people, but it can feel drastic. Uh… It’s sort of like when you go to the fridge for a jug of juice that you think is full, but it’s empty, and you’re like, “Whoa!” [crowd laughs loudly] [laughs] It’s the only way I can describe that. I was pregnant once, but I caught it early. And I went over to Planned Parenthood and got some… some Mife and Miso and… and what I call “jump-started a late period.” And then I went and did a table read and a taping for Comedy Central. So we really can have it all. [crowd laughs] And, you know, if you’re feeling like, um, you don’t align with this story or my beliefs, don’t worry. There is somebody in the story, that, um, shares yours. It’s a leprechaun in Orlando. Um… [crowd laughing] [applauding, cheering] My dad… [chuckles] My dad hates Planned Parenthood. [chuckles] He thinks all I do is kill babies because I got the one abortion there. [sucks teeth] You guys, I’m kidding. [chuckles] I haven’t told him yet, but… [crowd laughs] I always tell him if abortion were murder, there’d be a Law & Order: SVU about it. [chuckles] And that he understands. [crowd laughs] But I do like to donate to them in his name and… [crowd laughs] ‘Cause they do other stuff. There’s all kinds of people in there, um, looking for a good deal on an ultrasound. Um, getting those free condoms that are so thick. Uh… [laughs] Why are the free condoms so thick? It’s almost like they’re trying to drum up business. [chuckles] [crowd laughs] I… There’s people in there getting their penises checked and also their balls. I don’t want to alienate anybody here with balls. I… I never do. I love balls. [chuckles] I genuinely love balls. I could actually get emotional thinking about it. I… I love balls. I feel like they’re the closest I’ll come to a deep-sea creature. They’re just… [crowd laughs] …they’re so amorphous and malleable. [laughs] And then sometimes they shell up, you know. [crowd laughs] [chuckles] [Beth sighs] So I did this fundraiser. [crowd laughing] This fundraiser for Planned Parenthood. It’s this yearly event called the Birds and Bees Bash. That happens in Santa Barbara, California, where a bunch of rich old people gather together and throw money at the cause. It’s a beautiful thing. So they invited me to come do 15 minutes of stand-up, and I show up. It’s a swanky event, so I’ve slapped on a skirt, which is obviously a big deal for me. And they sit me down in the back of this beautiful banquet hall, next to Joanna Kerns. If you don’t know who that is, it’s Mrs. Seaver from Growing Pains. And if you don’t know who that is… [chuckles] …I don’t care. I was so excited. [crowd laughs] I sat down, and I was like, “Mom.” [crowd laughs] So she explains she’s going to give the keynote speech, and then she’ll bring me up to do stand-up. I was like, “Great.” So Joanna’s up there talking about Planned Parenthood and how they helped her and her family, uh, with breast exams, and a woman at the back of the room, at the table next to us, starts to have a heart attack. And Joanna just keeps talking ’cause she doesn’t know what’s going on in the back of the room. Just like I can’t know what’s going on in every room I’m in. People could be up in the balcony making sweet love, and we’d have no clue, especially if it was, like, super slow, like I like. [crowd laughs] So Joanna’s up here, talking, this woman is having a heart attack. I’m watching her have a heart attack, and I’m also thinking, like, “What jokes am I going to tell?” You know. [crowd chuckles] And then an ambulance comes very quickly, almost as if they knew there was a gathering of olds, and they just parked on the corner. [crowd laughs] So they rush in. They put this woman on the stretcher. Because it was a heart attack. It was a low-key heart attack. She fell out of her chair, and her husband was worried. But as they were wheeling her out on the stretcher, past our table, towards the door, she looked at us, and she said, “I’m so sorry. I’m fine.” “I’m so sorry.” [crowd laughs] Which might be the epitome of being a woman. Like, “I’m sorry I interrupted with a heart attack.” “I’m happy to die if that helps. I really will. I’ll go die.” [crowd chuckles] So just as they have her outside the door, this is when Joanna leans into the mic, and she said, “Who’s ready for some stand-up comedy?” [crowd laughing] And I was like, “Oh no.” So I get up, and I’m like weaving my way through the tables in my dumb skirt. And the woman who’s planned the event is panicked. And she rushes, she intercepts me, she puts her hand on my shoulder, and she’s like, “I don’t know.” “Maybe you should do less time, like 5 minutes or something?” I was like, “Bitch, I’m doing 15.” [crowd laughing loudly] So I got up there, and I felt like I really needed to address the situation, because I hadn’t learned this lesson yet. [crowd laughs] And I got up there in front of everybody, and I just said, “Wow.” “I have done a lot of things to get out of donating money, but never that!” [chuckles] [crowd laughs, applauds] [crowd cheering] [chuckles] There were less laughs. Uh… [crowd laughs] [chuckles] it’s taken me a few years to be able to talk about that. [crowd laughs] But I do feel like my dad would be proud of me. I bombed the Planned Parenthood. [chuckles] [laughs, sighs] Can a mammal from the weasel family do that? [crowd laughs] Feels like I’m making the Christmas card this year. [crowd laughs] [crowd cheering] Thank you very, very much for being here for me. [rock music plays] I love you. [mouthing] Thank you. [crowd cheering, applauding] [rock music continues] [rock music ends] Okay, where’s Tim? [crowd laughs] Tim is here, but he actually… I don’t want to ruin it for you guys. He did babysit for me, but that other part was a joke. [crowd laughing] Aw. Are you guys disappointed he’s a good guy, or…? [laughs] [crowd laughs] Kara and I worked at, um, Graeter’s together. First job. [crowd cheers] I invented the chocolate weasel, so if you ever enjoyed that, you’re welcome. [crowd laughs] [woman] Tim’s up here! Love you, Tim. [crowd laughing] Oh, Tim would be in the balcony… to get a better view. [crowd cheers] I’m kidding. I’m sorry. My mom’s here. There she is. Give it up for Diane here. [crowd cheers] The Schaeffer family. My second family here in town. Schaeffers, Beth and Alan. Amy may or may not have been there that night that we went to UD. [crowd laughs] [Beth] You knew it. You had to come pick us up. Alan’s like, “Can I not be a lawyer for one night?!” [crowd laughs] [Christmas music playing] [Christmas music ends] Your email address will not be published.

       " [\"[audience cheering, whistling] [emcee] Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Burr! [cheering and applause] All right, thank you! Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you, thank you. How are ya? How’s it goin’? All right. You guys standin’ up, sit down. Sit down. See if I’m funny. I’ve been inside for a year and a half just like you. All right. It’s nice to be out here in Denver, man. [cheering] [chuckles] It’s legal on a state level, but not on a federal level, man. Everybody out here dressing like they’re fuckin’ goin’ hiking. [chuckles] Your North Face pajamas and all this shit you guys have. You guys all live inside. So, how have you guys been doin’, man? How has your pandemic been? You enjoyed it? You been staying inside? Are you being safe? [man] No! I am so fed up with people… “I ain’t bein’ safe! I don’t fuckin’ believe in it!” “It’s all a bunch of lies!” We’re just totally divided. The people that are like, “You gotta get vaccinated.” “You have to wrap yourself in an afghan, and you gotta cover your face and hold your breath when you look at pictures of people.” And you got the other side, “I don’t give a shit!” “I’m gonna have my balls out, walkin’ down the street, ’cause that’s what Jesus said in John 13.” “I read it in my bible study class. I don’t give a fuck.” “And if I get it, I’m goin’ to the hospital and be like, ‘All right, fix me, you were right.'” Everybody, all hypocritical. All the liberals, “You gotta wear the mask, gotta wear the mask.” Then half of them when they talk, they’re pullin’ it down. They got it up under their fuckin’ nose. Then the other assholes, they were all patriotic for years. “America, love it or leave it!” “Support the troops!” “You don’t like it, get the fuck out.” “America, love it or leave it.” All right, take the vaccine. “Well, I don’t trust the government.” Where the fuck did that come from? I thought you were all about it. I thought you were waving the flag and all of that shit. Listen, here’s the deal. We’re never gonna solve this shit until we all get on the same page, which we know is never gonna happen, it’s never gonna happen. So, we gotta set up some Hunger Games shit to solve it. And whoever wins, wins. It’s the non-vaxxers versus the vaxxers. So there’s a giant field, and all the people who don’t want to get the vaccine, all the fatties and the fuckin’ lunatics, right? You gotta fuckin’ run the length of the field and try to make it to the other side while there’s a helicopter flying over you and they’re shooting the vaccine down at you. All right? And I know what you’re thinkin’, “Well, that ain’t fair, man.” “I’m runnin’ in my shit-kickers, you’re up there in a helicopter and you got a gun.” Well, here’s how we… It’s a liberal with a gun, right? They’re not good at that. Say, “Oh, my God, is it alive? Is it gonna hit me?” “I don’t feel safe!” And by then, you’re already halfway there. One of the straps of your overalls is off. If you make it to the other side, in the end, just like dodgeball, we’ll just score it. “Who won?” It’s an idea, I don’t know. I just… I don’t know what else to do. I’ve kind of quit. I’m like… I’ve got to be honest with you. For the first like, you know, year of this shit, I was an American, you know, and I was rootin’ for everybody, and then, I don’t know. They let us outside for a couple of weeks and then they sent us back in, and I just didn’t have it in me anymore. It’s like, “I don’t care. I just don’t give a shit.” “You know, I hope a lot more people die, I really do.” But the one good thing about this whole pandemic shit, and I really hope by the time this fuckin’ thing comes out that this will be considered old, I don’t know, God willing, but the one great thing about this pandemic shit is it kind of slowed down a little bit of that cancel culture. You know what I mean? Yeah. It’s kind of hard to take your dick out at work when you’re at home. You know? Some people still manage to do it. They’re on a Zoom call, no pants on. All of the sudden, standing up, their chunk right in the screen. Still figured out a way to get fired. It was unreal. It’s kind of good, though, that those creeps got to take a break, ’cause I felt like cancel culture, they were kind of running out of people to cancel. You know? As much as they wanted to make it seem, there really was a finite amount of people that took their dick out at work. Despite the stats, right? “Every 1.6 seconds, somebody takes their dick out and shakes it in a woman’s face in a cubicle.” You’re like, “What? Every 1.6 seconds?” I must not have been paying attention. “Every 3.2 seconds, some man jizzes on a fern and rubs it in a woman’s face.” Holy shit! I didn’t know that. Right? Yeah. So fortunately they rounded up all of these fuckin’ animals… and they got rid of them, right? But it kind of became like this cottage industry and it was a way to kind of get rid of some men that maybe were in your way, you know? It’s like anything. You know, the initial thing, you agree with it, and then it kind of gets out of control. So, I don’t know. But it kind of ran out of people and there was this hilarious moment, like last year where they started to try and cancel dead people. Remember that? All of the sudden, out of nowhere, John Wayne was trending. Have they got some found footage, a new movie coming out that maybe they shelved? Then all of the sudden it was all these stupid-ass “woke” white people, right? “Oh, my God, did you see what John Wayne said in Playboy in 1971?” Can you… this is a bunch of fuckin’ white people all up in arms about a dead white guy. “I can no longer tolerate this.” “I can no longer tolerate dead-for-45-years John Wayne saying things in a magazine that doesn’t exist anymore.” “I am here for Black people.” These fuckin’ idiots. What kind of a fuckin’ idiot white person refers to themselves as “woke”? You know? If you actually were socially conscious, you’d realize that white people stole that word from Black people. Once again doin’ the Elvis thing. Right? But you know what, I blame Black people for that. One of them fucked up. They were at a party, there was white people there, and they let it slip out. “Stay woke” or however the fuck you say it. And some white person heard it, like, “Ah, what was that?” “Oh, my God.” “‘Stay woke’? I wanna say that.” “I gotta say that around my white friends so they know that I’m down.” “Oh, my God, I’m gonna fuckin’ say that.” “I’m fuckin’ woke. I’m fuckin’ woke.” “I’m a woke stickler.” “I’ve fuckin’ had it, I’ve had it.” “I support Black people in my white apartment on Twitter.” “That’s what I do. I’m fuckin’ here for you.” Every white person likes to lie to themselves that if they were alive 150 years ago, that they would have been working on the underground railroad, trying to help slaves escape, right? “I would be one of the good white people, yes.” “I would have taken time out of my day, risked my life.” And the reality is, is you’d be doing back then exactly what you’re doing today… nothin’. Not a fuckin’ thing. Maybe a little #BlackLivesMatter. “Oh, my God, my heart breaks on my L-shaped couch.” My favorite thing about the Black Lives Matter marches was the store windows that would have the plywood over the windows, and then it would say, “Black lives matter” on top of the plywood. I just loved the duality of that message, you know? It’s like, “Black lives matter, we’re all the same, we’re all one.” “Don’t burn down my store, you fuckin’ animals!” “Everybody is welcome in this store.” “Anyone can come in.” “One at a time, follow him!” “It’s just a safe space for everyone.” Yeah. John Wayne was born in 1907. That’s what the fuck he’s gonna sound like. Then you got all these douchebags going like, “That’s not an excuse.” It’s like, “Yes, it is.” It absolutely is. You are of your time. Look at these young kids. Remember, for a year and a half, they’d take a water bottle. They’re all standing around and one kid would flip it, and if it landed upright, they’d go… [screaming] “Oh, shit!” And they’d just lose their fuckin’ minds. I didn’t understand it. But I’m born in 1968, so I’m just like, “All right, well, no one tried to slap it out of the way.” “You do it enough times, it’s gonna fuckin’ land upright.” “What is happening here?” Right? I don’t wanna ruin their good time. They’re excited, they’re gonna get on their scooters and ride off. Like a little posse or some shit. I’m like, all right, you can do that. Yeah. So that was like a thing for like half a second. Sean Connery died. The great Sean Connery. Yeah, my favorite James Bond of all time. Yeah. And he was getting a proper send-off for about eight minutes on Twitter, and then the first hairy-leg white chick shows up, right? And she’s just gotta be like, “Really? Really?” “Are we really gonna celebrate this man who advocated the hitting of women?” It’s like, first of all, he didn’t advocate hitting women, okay? [as Connery] He just, “Every once in a while, you give ’em a little slap.” “Yeah, give ’em a little back of the hand, ya remind ’em who’s making the bucks off this shit.” “Reset their hard drive.” That’s all he said, okay? Yes, it’s a crazy statement in 2021. 1976, you know, it’s not good, but it’s not crazy. Right? And he’s born in 1930. You gotta put this shit in historical perspective. I love old movies. You ever watch movies from the ’30s, ’40s, and ’50s? Yeah. Any time a woman even has heightened emotion, there’s some guy like, “Get ahold of yourself!” “Yeah, go make me a pie. Put it on the windowsill.” Right? That’s what he grew up watchin’. I grew up in the ’70s. I thought being a truck driver was a cool thing. You know, you had a monkey for a friend. Going around, chicks are showin’ their titties. I thought that that was the world. I had no idea, that’s what I was watching. My thing is, okay, so if you’re gonna cancel all of these fuckin’ dead guys and shit all over them after they’re dead and they can’t defend themselves, why are you only going after men? You know, what about all the horrible women in history? You can’t just go after the men, that would be sexist, and this is what they don’t want. You know? I mean, what about Coco Chanel? Great example. Coco Chanel. Widely considered a feminist icon. She started her own purse factory, right, in the 19-teens or ’20s, whatever the hell she did. I can’t imagine the sexism that she had to deal with, you know. An amazing accomplishment, hats off to her, right? However, she was also a Nazi sympathizer. Yeah. That’s like half her fucking Wikipedia page, just sitting there, waiting for someone to read it. Right out in the open, nothin’. So evidently, what happened was, in World War II, old Adolf came rolling into town, okay, with his tanks with the Porsche engines in ’em, took over the town in like 90 minutes. She freaked out. She closes up her shop, right? Figured out where all the head Nazis were staying, what hotel. She moved in there and she started a relationship with one of the Nazis. Yeah. She started fucking a Nazi. You ever see those Holocaust videos? Huh? With those piles of kids’ shoes? Yeah. She was sucking the dick that did that. Now, just to refresh my memory, what did Sean Connery do again? “Oh, you know, every once in a while, you give ’em a little slap.” That’s what he did. She’s sittin’ there like, “Hey, Adolf, what’s goin’ on?” She so sold out her own country, she had to flee it at the end of the war, and I have no idea how many dicks she had to suck to get back in it. But despite all of that, I still don’t judge her. I don’t, ’cause I’ve never been in that situation. You know, I’ve never been in a country where all of the sudden, the most powerful army the world has ever seen comes in and takes it over in a couple of hours. She must have been terrified, right? And she’s a woman. You know? She’s into fashion. They show up with those Hugo Boss uniforms. You know, her knees buckle a little bit. Things start getting ugly, people are getting shot in the street. She’s freakin’ out. You know. And she’s a woman, and women know push comes to shove when you get your back against the wall. No matter how bad it gets, they always have the option of fucking their way out of a situation. They always got that card they can play. Right? All women know this. Women, all women know this. Men don’t realize this till they go to prison. But women learn this early on. She had the option and she took it. I can’t get mad at her for that, you know? So she’s dead and gone. I think she’s up there in heaven. I think she made it. She’s up there with Sean Connery. Every once in a while, they have a disagreement, he gives her a little slap, you know? She doesn’t care. Once you shit on a Nazi’s chest, a little backhand’s not gonna freak you out. Jesus can’t say anything, he got a hooker, right? Everybody’s got a little something they did. Well, there you go, boom. Still buy your Coco Chanel. She’s still a hero. She was a victim, she was a victim of that time. She was frightened, she was scared. She didn’t know what to do. Uh… anyway. So, we’re living in a fucking weird time. Obviously, beyond all the bullshit that’s going on now, like, every time I think feminism has kind of like died off, you know, you know, like a band you can’t stand and they haven’t put out an album in a few years, you’re like, “Oh, good, did they quit, did they break up?” All of the sudden, they come out with more shit. You’re like, “Fuck, what is it now?” I’m just fucking with you. Feminism doesn’t bug me, you know? It doesn’t bother me. I’m not afraid of it or anything like that, you know, for the simple fact that I know it’s gonna fail, you know? And I take com\",\n",
       "  'fort in that, I do. I’m not rooting for it because… I know it doesn’t like me. Um… Yeah, do you know why I think it’s not going to survive, why it’s not going to be successful anyway? ‘Cause they still need men’s help to make it happen. I don’t understand it. I don’t understand why women just can’t work with each other and make this shit happen. They keep coming to us, like, “More men need to care about this issue.” “Where are the men to stand up and say something… yak-yak-yak.” Why do I have to fuckin’ say something? This is your fuckin’ problem. Why are you always dragging us into this shit? I saw a woman a couple months back, professional soccer player, right? She goes onto ESPN on one of these sports channels and she starts bitching, going like, “I don’t understand, how come female athletes don’t make as much as male professional athletes?” Right? And all of these men had to sit there and act like they didn’t know what the answer was. They had to sit there, like, dumbfounded. Like, “Oh, I don’t know.” “Why is that?” “That is a conundrum. I have no idea.” Literally, I’m sitting at home screaming at the TV, “‘Cause you don’t sell any fuckin’ tickets!” Nobody is going to women’s soccer games. You’re playing in a 20,000-seat arena, 1,500 people show up. That’s not a good night. The promoter lost his fucking ass on that gig. I’m not saying no professional female athletes… Serena Williams, the women in the UFC, you know? But nobody’s watching your fuckin’ sport. And then you’re gonna come and you’re gonna get mad at fuckin’ men. They keep doing that shit. Why are you yelling at us? It’s not our fucking job. It’s not my fuckin’ job to give a fuck about women’s soccer, okay? I have men’s sport to pay attention to. This is… it’s your bullshit, right? Dude, look at the WNBA. Dude, nobody in the WNBA got COVID. Nobody. They have been playing in front of 300 to 400 people a night for a quarter of a century. Not to mention it’s a male-subsidized league. We gave ya a fuckin’ league. None of ya showed up. Where are all the feminists? That place should be packed with feminists. Faces painted, wearing jerseys, flashin’ their titties. Goin’ fuckin’ nuts, like the guys do in the upper deck with their big beer titties. “Am I on the jumbotron? Am I doing it?” Yeah. You didn’t. None of you, none of you went to the fuckin’ games. None of you. You all, you failed them, not me. Not men. Women failed the WNBA. Ladies, ladies, name your top five all-time WNBA players of all time. Come on. Let’s hear it. Name five WNBA teams. Name the WNBA team in your fuckin’ city. You can’t do it! You don’t give a fuck about them. They play night in and night out in front of nobody. It’s a fuckin’ tragedy, right? And then meanwhile, you look at the Kardashians, they’re making billions. You look at those Real Housewives shows, they’re making money hand over fist ’cause that’s what women are watchin’. The money listens. You don’t wanna watch this shit, you’re watching this shit. They just shoot it over there, drowning these whores in money and purses and shoes and Botox. It’s just raining. It’s raining money. Yeah. So, the money listens. You’d rather watch that shit, Real Housewives, a bunch of women just tearing each other down. “Well, maybe that’s why your husband left you.” “Maybe that’s why your husband left. That’s why you can’t have kids, bitch!” “That’s why your ass is as flat as your titties, bitch.” Right? That’s the message you sent. “We would rather watch that than see a bunch of women come together as a team and try to achieve a common goal.” “We would rather watch them actually fucking destroy each other.” Yeah. No, no, no. And then in the end, you come back and you fuckin’ yell at guys. And it’s like, let me get this straight, I have to buy you a drink, stop the axe murderer from coming through the fuckin’ window, and I have to watch WNBA games for you? Like, when are you gonna pick up your end of the couch? Yeah. I don’t have any sympathy for women when it comes to shit like that because every study they’ve ever done to determine who’s smarter, men or women, every study comes back and says women are smarter. Every fuckin’ one. Ladies, you shouldn’t be applauding that. You know I’m an asshole. You know this isn’t gonna end well. “Did he say I’m pretty?” “Oh, my God.” Get out of the relationship. If every study says that you’re smarter, okay, the question you should be asking yourself, if we’re so goddamn smart, how are we in the situation we’re in? Well? You’re in the situation you’re in not because of guys like me. As much as you want to blame me, you know? Ladies, you never drove by a sports bar on a football Sunday and looked at the humanity in there? All those dumb guys with their big beer bellies bumpin’ shit. “Hey, he’s on my fantasy team!” “Up top, yeah!” “You wanna get some more mozzarella sticks?” As a woman with your bigger brain, you never looked in there and thought to yourself, “I’m fuckin’ losin’ to that?” “I’m losin’ to that?” Yeah, there’s nothing stopping you. Other than the fact that you guys are just into destroying each other. Oh, now it’s gonna get quiet? I see all that sneaky shit you do. Ladies, if you could just support the WNBA the way you support a fat chick that’s proud of her body and is no longer a threat to you, you know? That league would be doing better numbers than the NBA. Oh, my God, that’s one of the saddest things I’ve ever seen. “Oh, my God, you’re a goddess, you’re gorgeous.” “You look great in that bikini.” “I would kill myself if I looked like that.” “Keep eating, keep eating.” “Lose a toe, you fat bitch.” It’s just… You saw an alcoholic, would you be like, “Oh, my God, look at you.” “You’re facedown, passed out, your kids are crying.” “You’re a hero, you’re a god.” “Keep doing what you’re doing.” You’d be like, “Dude, get your fuckin’ shit together.” “Get off the sauce.” I will say that’s one of the most genius things I’ve ever seen, how regular-looking women somehow mind-fucked advertising to get beautiful women off of billboards. Yeah. Just regular fuckin’ who-gives-a-shit-lookin’ women, right? I’m just being honest. Come on, we’re outside, we’re in the woods, we can be honest. Just regular who-gives-a-fuck… can’t-remember-her-name-looking women. Right? Lookin’ at these goddesses and they had to fuckin’ be… “How am I supposed to compete with that?” You can’t! How fucking arrogant are you? I don’t see Brad Pitt when he takes his shirt off in a movie and, “Oh, great, how am I supposed to compete with that?” I can’t. I am an ugly, bald, orange man. I need to write jokes. I gotta put a lampshade on my head. I know what my role is, okay? I should be on the ground gazing up at people better-looking than me. I don’t know, ladies, this is supposed to be like an inspirational talk. I don’t know if it’s coming through this way. I’m trying to say, if you really like… If you get through all the misdirected anger of my childhood… I’m trying to say, you’re smarter than we are and there’s more of you. I don’t know. I don’t know what to tell you. I’m trying to be… I don’t know. Trying to be a better person during all of this shit, you know? I am. You know, I got this new thing, man. I try to help out homeless people. You know? Sometimes I help them out, sometimes I don’t. You know, it’s like the mood you’re in, how much they freak you out. You know? So, this is what I do. You got to do something because people at the top don’t seem to be doing anything. I try to bring all my old clothes down to the tent cities to give it to them. It’s a good thing to do, but I gotta tell you something, you gotta do it during the day. All right? You want to do it during the day when they’re tired from Thunderdome the night before, they’re coming down from whatever they’re on, realizing there’s a nail in their shoulder. You want to get them when they’re tired. You don’t go at night. No one’s gonna see you again, you’re gonna end up on a fuckin’ spit. I mean, you’re under an overpass, you never know what can happen, okay? I’m just warning you ’cause they don’t make homeless people the way they made them when I was a kid, you know? When I was a kid, a homeless guy was a bum, he was a vagrant, somebody down on his luck or whatever. You know, a wino. They didn’t have this Shutter Island shit going on that they had out there, like people talking to trees. [shouting gibberish] You’re right here having, like, eggs Benedict. He’s, like, looking through a porthole over your cabbage. Yeah. When I was a kid, you could only be crazy outside for about 15 minutes before a van would pull up and two guys in nurses’ outfits would just come walking out. “Hey, buddy, how’s it going?” “You’re making a lot of racket out here, aren’t ya?” “Why don’t you do me a favor, try this shirt on?” Be like, “Okay. How come the sleeves are so long?” “Oh, because we’re gonna tie your arms behind your back ’cause you’re out of your fucking mind, that’s it.” “Not gonna have you out here scaring the shit out of people.” “Get in the fuckin’ van!” And he got in the van and that was it. They send you to a nuthouse. That’s it, boom, bam, done, nuthouse. But the problem was the people at the nuthouses started fucking the patients ’cause everybody knows crazy people are great in bed, right? So they’re banging away, right? Hey, it happened. You’re groaning at history, all right? You can shake your heads all you want, but… Hey, hey! They fucked those people, all right? And they were banging away, doctors with their fuckin’ lab coats flappin’ in the wind, just banging away, until finally… for decades… finally somebody with a heart came walking in, “Hey, what the fuck is going on here?” And then they shut it down and then they just let all these people go. They all came running out like Mike Myers, jumping up on station wagons and shit. So that’s the thing, you go during the day. And I gotta tell you, when I pull up to one of these tent cities, I always feel good about myself. “This is good, man, helping out a fellow American.” “I would want them to do that for me.” “It’s fuckin’ ridiculous people have to live like that.” That’s what I think when I’m in the car, and then the second I get out and that smell hits me, I’m like, “What the fuck am I doing? Jesus Christ, these people are animals!” Right? I would equate it to the same feeling you probably get if you were on a safari and you’re in the Land Rover, and you look over and you see, like, a leopard. You’re like, “Look at that leopard over there.” Right? Then all of the sudden you go over a bump and fall out of the fuckin’ Range Rover. “Oh, fuck, that’s a leopard!” Yeah, so I pull up and I’m feeling like fuckin’ Uncle Sam. Then I get out of the car and I’m like, “What the fuck am I doing?” I start walking like this. There’s always some sort of movement going on, somebody fuckin’ limping across the street or something. And I’ve never been able to get close enough to talk, really, to anybody. You know, like they do on the news. You know, like, “Jeez, have you been sitting in here, you know, for a couple of months?” “What is it like to be inside of this tent?” I always wondered how many people they had to choke out before they could get that fuckin’ interview. You know, just comin’ in… blow darts. Numbin’ up everybody else. Building a perimeter. So, what I… What I do is I get about 30 yards away, and then I just start walking like this. And then I chicken out, I always chicken out. Thirty yards away, I just go, “Free shirts!” I run back to the car. And that’s when your brain starts playing tricks on you. Like I’m convinced somebody just came running out of the tent with a 2-by-4. Running after me. So I always do a lap around my car before I get in it, you know. ‘Cause homeless people have horrible lateral movement. You know, from all those years of sleeping on the sidewalk, their hips are just junk, you know, like an NFL running back. They slow down like a cruise ship, go right up and over the horizon. So in that time, you go around, you get in your car, you drive away. You drive away. Your closet’s a little more empty. You can go out, you can fill it back up again with shit you don’t fuckin’ need, you know, that’s what you do. [man] America! What’s that, sir? [man] America! America, yeah! America! Don’t think. Just do what you wanna do. Take your dick out, you know? I’ll tell ya, that’s what George Washington was talking about. You know? They really need to shut down the Internet. We are clearly too stupid to all be sharing ideas in this giant townie bar that we’ve created. You guys are all cheering, you’re all on the Internet just like me. I was on the Internet for six hours last night. Trying to figure out what kills a beaver, you know? Does a beaver have a natural predator? No. You wouldn’t know it from all the ignorant shit I’ve said so far, but I am a changed person, believe it or not. I am. I had an experience earlier this year. [man] Bullshit. This is all true. You don’t think so? Guy just yelled “bullshit.” Are you saying “bullshit,” sir, ’cause you don’t believe me or ’cause you don’t want me to leave? Is that what it is? The little angry circle that you’re in? Don’t be goin’ and gettin’ happy now. Don’t be goin’ and gettin’ soft on me. Don’t start huggin’ people and lovin’ yourself. And cryin’ when you see somethin’ cute. Hang onto it! Lash out at people. Reach for your pistol under the seat. Do it! [man] Yeah! No, I took mushrooms back in February for the first time ever. [audience cheering, whistling] This is the perfect state to tell this story. You guys should literally have… you should have mushrooms on your fuckin',\n",
       "  '’ license plate. All right, so here’s the deal. I never fucked with anything like that. I was always a booze guy. Always a booze guy, you know. Yeah, you know. Relax, everybody. I always get nervous when I get white guys going like, “Yeah! All right, whoo!” “All right!” “Build the wall! Yeah!” I’m fuckin’ around, relax. It’s frightening to listen to, but that’s what being a guy is. You’re not allowed to have emotions. So all that shit comes out when you’re drinking. [growling] “Do something dumb so I don’t feel stupid!” So… yeah, I was always like a booze guy, so I never fucked with psychedelics or whatever, so it was one of these deals. I was out in the desert, man, and I was like, all right, I got somebody watching my kids. Everything’s fine, I’m in my fifties. I gotta do it now or I’m never gonna do it, right? So this person, who may or may not have been my opening act tonight, goes, “All right, man.” Uh… He’s a good man, he’s a good man. He says to me, he goes, “All right.” He goes, “Okay, just take like, you know…” You know, it’s always just like, “All right, so, like, how fucked up do you wanna get, all right?” And there’s always like a square and it’s like, “Okay, don’t eat the whole square.” “Just like, bite one corner, lick the other one, and then rub the other one.” “Let it absorb in your face or whatever.” So, I’m like, “All right.” He goes, “How far into it do you wanna go?” I go, “I just wanna trip a little bit, nothing crazy.” So he goes, “Fine,” so I ate just a little bit. I get a little nauseous or whatever. At first it feels like I ate some weed, but then all of the sudden I notice shit that’s not alive looks like it’s breathing, right? Like the refrigerator looked like it just did a lap around the house. It’s kind of… Nothin’ threatening, you know. It needed it, you know. TV started getting bigger. It’s looking like it’s gonna fall on me. All right, and I was doing fine. I was like, “I know that TV’s not getting bigger.” “And if it is, I don’t give a shit, go ahead.” “Spill that pixelation all over me, I don’t give a fuck.” “I know I’m trippin’, I’m having fun. I’m giggling.” I’m laughing and shit, I’m putting things together, and everything is fuckin’ great. And all of the sudden, about an hour in… all of a sudden this profound sense of loneliness and not feeling loved just washed over me. Yeah, and I was just like, “I fuckin’ knew it.” I fuckin’ knew it. This is why I didn’t do it. I knew I had too many demons. I knew I wasn’t going to see God and fuckin’ unicorns and slide down the rainbow and roll around in the grass. I fuckin’ knew Satan was coming up. There was gonna be a guy with a knife and shit. I was just like, “All right, go ahead. Drag me into the abyss.” “Let me see how fucked up I am,” and this feeling, it just enveloped me, and I don’t even know how to describe it, it wasn’t even a feeling. It just was, it just was. So I’m freakin’ the fuck out. I’m sitting there like, “What the fuck?” I can’t get out of it, dude. Like I could walk a hundred fuckin’ million miles, I can’t walk out of it, it just was. So everybody else is, like, trippin’, I didn’t want to fuckin’ ruin their trip, so I’m just like, “All right, dude, I’m just gonna go to the bedroom.” “Oh, look at the refrigerator. Refrigerator…” [laughing nervously] All right. “I’m just feelin’ a little nauseous.” Just playin’ it up, right? Goin’ in the fuckin’ bedroom, and I’m just layin’ down in the bedroom like, “Dude, what the fuck? What the fuck?” And every time I thought I felt the bottom, it would just… just further into the bed, further into the bed, further into the bed. So about a half hour later, my wife comes in. She’s like, “Hey, how you doing?” Typical guy. “Great, I’m doin’ great.” “I’m doin’ great.” “It’s goin’ great.” So she’s laying next to me, “I’m feeling a little nauseous, this is a little bit much for me.” And she’s just laying down and I’m just feeling this feeling. Not feeling loved, profound sense of loneliness. So now I’m just looking at my wife, and my brain just starts going like, “Oh, fuck, did I marry the wrong person?” “Why am I lookin’ at…” I know it seems fucked up, but once you’re married long enough, even not on mushrooms, you have that thought every fuckin’ six weeks. You just do. Something happens where you just look at the side of their head and just do the math and just think, “Why did I ever talk to you?” “I could have just walked by. I didn’t even have to say hello.” “We had no relationship.” “We were nothing!” “What would happen if I just never talked to you?” Every six weeks, you think that’s a healthy relationship? That means you’ve still held on to a part of yourself that even though you love this person, you still, you know, you still want to run around like a mustang a little bit, right? So anyways, I’m like, that was freaking me out even more to think of my wife and be feeling that. So I was like, “Fuck, I need to pull the rip cord.” “I gotta get out of this fuckin’… it’s like a giant beanbag.” Couldn’t get out of it, right? So I was like, “Oh, fuck.” Think about your kids. Now, I love my kids. And I know they love me, there is no fuckin’ question. And I start thinking about my kids. And I still felt that feeling. And I was like, “All right, what the fuck is this?” ‘Cause I know that’s bullshit. And I just sort of laid there. And I relaxed. And I went, “Oh, fuck, I know what this is.” This is how I felt growing up. [chuckles] Yeah. This is what the ’70s and ’80s were like. Both your parents worked. You got a set of keys to the house when you were three. “Oh, yeah, son. Get the fuck out of my face, son.” It was fuckin’ nuts, yeah. I grew up in a very, like, angry time, you know? Like, you were afraid of your dad, your dad’s dad. I talked about this shit before, but I’m still working through it, so just bear with me. You just were fuckin’… Yeah, like I love seeing kids nowadays loving their dad. Like, “Dad, wanna go play, Dad? Let’s go ride bikes! Dad!” Yeah, when I was a kid, it was like, “Dad, fuck, Dad!” “Fuck!” “Run! Open a window.” “Mom, what did you see in that?” – Fucking lunatic, right? [man] Yeah! It was absolute fuckin’ lunacy. And not just my house. I love my parents, but it was just the time. Everybody was fuckin’ crazy, you were afraid, and people could put their hands on you and other people’s dads could hit you, and then you come home, “What the fuck did you do?” “I’ll fuckin’ hit you for it!” It was just nuts. Teachers would grab you, dig their nails into your fuckin’ neck. She’d come home, “She wouldn’t have done that unless something happened.” Right? It was all of that shit. Me and my siblings, we all beat the shit out of each other. You know. And then we all teased the dog, and the dog bit all of us. And we never got rid of the dog. One time the dog bit me in the face. I was fuckin’ with it, it was eating, I was like… And he latched onto my face like… Like that. My dad had to stitch me up and everything. We still didn’t get rid of the dog, you know? “Aw, he’s a good dog, he had a moment.” “Jesus Christ, you shouldn’t have put your goddamn face down there near the fuckin’ dog.” Yeah. So that’s all it was. It was weird, we were like The Brady Bunch meets Lord of the Flies. Like, on paper, it was great. It was a station wagon full of fuckin’, you know… Norman Rockwell, we went to church, we got Dunkin’ Donuts. Yeah, that was about the fuck… so… I don’t know, so anyway, we all ended up… My dad was one of those people, he said whatever the fuck was on his mind. You know what I mean? Yeah. You know, like that haircut women get when they get to a certain age? They got a couple of kids, they just get it cut a little shorter ’cause they don’t wanna deal with it. They put that little Hillary Clinton flip in it or something. Right? They get it all shaved up the fuckin’ back. First time you bend ’em over, you feel like you’re fuckin’ your friend Eric. Right? You know? But you love your wife, so you lie and you tell them, “Oh, looks good.” “Looks great, I always wanted to fuck Geraldine Ferraro.” “My God, it’s amazing.” My dad didn’t care. We picked my mother up, she got in the car, he just goes, “Aw, Christ, it looks like shit!” “Jesus Christ, what the fuck did they do to you?” “Aw, for Christ’s sake, you look like a fuckin’ man.” My mom’s just sittin’ there like… We’re in the back seat like, “This is what a functional relationship looks like.” Whoo! Yeah. So, because of all that, we all ended up getting, like, physical ailments from being in the fight-or-flight mode our whole lives. Everything, gym teachers were scary, collecting on your paper… Everybody was scary fuckin’ everything. One time my dad told a priest he didn’t deserve to wear the collar. I don’t know how it happened. We were discussing the altar boys’ schedule… and, I don’t know, he wanted to put me on a different mass, and my dad started getting his leg going. “You don’t deserve to wear the fucking collar!” The guy’s jaw was on the ground, and then the best part, next week we go to mass. They haven’t spoken in a week, and my dad comes walkin’ like, “Hey, how you doin’, what’s going on?” Like nothing happened. Yeah, so anyway, we all end up getting these physical ailments. Like one of my siblings has stomach problems, another one has this pain that won’t go away in his back. I remember I had, like, alopecia in, like, the third grade. Third grade, I literally had clumps of hair falling out like I was working on Wall Street, you know. And I was just sitting there like, “Did I pick up all the toys?” “Did I do the dishes?” “He’s gonna find something, he always finds something.” “Fuck, what do I do? I gotta kill him.” “I should kill him, that’s what I should do.” “When he’s sleeping, I’ll take an extension cord.” “I’ll wrap it around, put my fuckin’ foot on his back.” “Billy seems to lack the focus in class that he needs.” “He’s not working up to his ability.” Right? Yeah, so, anyway, I took these fuckin’ mushrooms. All right? And I realized that I have been carrying that shit around and being like, all right, well, that’s why I drank the way I did. That’s why I’ve trashed women the way I… All the fuckin’ shit. I knew every fuckin’ thing I did, good and bad, in that moment. I was like, all right, now I got to get sober and I got to fuckin’ work my way through this shit, because, you know, my wife… I don’t know if you guys noticed, I have a bit of a temper. [chuckles] “No, not you, Bill.” Yeah. So here’s the thing, you know, I’m so fucked up and grew up in such a fucked-up time that I didn’t even think I had a temper ’cause I was like, “I don’t fuckin’ yell at people in my house.” I curse my wife out, I mean we get into it. I get into it with her, but I don’t go like, “Jesus Christ, you fuckin’ bitch,” I don’t do that stuff. I don’t yell at my kids, but what I do is… what I still do is I flip out. So, like I said, I didn’t think that this was a problem. My wife told me it was a problem, but I don’t listen to her, you know. Why would I listen to her? All she does is criticize, you know? I got nothing but bad reviews on the fuckin’ Husband Yelp. It’s just all, “You know, didn’t enjoy the experience.” “Thumbs down, half a star,” never get a fuckin’ “attaboy,” right? So it just becomes white noise after a while. “What, am I doing something wrong again? Oh, yeah, you again, okay, great.” “Great, what did I do this time, huh?” “What do I have to work on?” “Go ahead, fuckin’ let me know,” right? So, I don’t listen to my lovely wife. Like an idiot… Like the idiot that I am, so… One day I learned a harsh lesson, okay? It was a breakfast time. For some reason I had, like, 20 minutes to myself, which is really rare when you got two kids four and under, right? So I’m thinking like, “Holy shit, I can actually make myself a breakfast, like the old days.” “I’ll make two eggs over easy, I’ll make some toast, I’ll make some bacon, fuckin’ burn it up the way I like it.” “It’s gonna be the shit, right?” So I’m having a great time, making myself a Grand Slam breakfast. I sit down to eat, I got the OJ, I got the glass of water. It looks like a picture from a commercial. And right as I sit down to eat, my phone lights up and I get a text message from my buddy. He goes, “Hey, man, I thought you were coming on this Zoom meeting.” “It started five minutes ago, we need you on this.” And I just absolutely lost it. I was like, Jesus Christ, of course I have a meeting. Of course I have my meeting, because why couldn’t I just have one goddamn cocksucking motherfucking moment to myself?! Fuckin’ toast flying all over the place. Flippin’ the fuck up. And then all of the sudden, my daughter, who was like two and a half at the time, comes running into the kitchen with big tears in her eyes, just going, “I sorry, I sorry, Dada. Dada, I sorry.” And I was like, “Oh, shit!” So I literally just squatted down, I was like, “No, buddy, come here.” “I wasn’t yelling at you. Daddy would never yell at you.” “I love you, buddy. Daddy was yelling at the phone, okay?” “Dad yells at the phone when it says stuff that he doesn’t like, okay?” “Your dad has issues. I’m sorry, buddy. I would never yell at you.” And I could literally feel her tears drying in my shirt. I was like, “Buddy, I would never do that, okay?” “I love you. You still love me?” She said, “Yeah.” I go, “Okay, all right, buddy.” And then you know when you do that thing with a kid where you turn them around and push them in the direction you want them to go in? And I just had to sit there like, I just did that to a two-and-a-half-year-old, and she was like walking away, and I’m just sitting there thinking lik',\n",
       "  'e, “How bad was that?” “Is she just gonna go play with a toy and forget about it, or is she no longer gonna be an astronaut?” Like, what did I just do? I thought I was better than my dad, I’m making the same mistakes that he’s making. I fuckin’ hate myself. I didn’t do the meeting, I didn’t eat the breakfast. I just went upstairs, just wanted to be alone, right? Just want to be fuckin’ alone, but I got a wife, so it doesn’t work that way. You know? Especially when you fuck up as bad as I did and as loudly as I did. I knew she was comin’ down the hall. I knew I was going to have to watch some game film. She was bringing the projector, the screen was gonna come down, and I’m literally just laying in there, like, “Please, God, just let her give me two minutes to fuckin’ calm down.” Nope, she just comes right in and she’s just like, “So… you wanna discuss that little incident that happened downstairs in the kitchen?” And I’m like, “No, honey, can you just give me a second?” “My heart is still on the floor. Give me a second. I know I fucked up.” She doesn’t give a shit at that point, and she’s right, it’s her kid too, so she just launched in, “If you think you can do this in this fuckin’ house…” All this shit, and… I mean, she was 100% right, but I wasn’t ready to hear the information. So she just sort of zoned out. “They’re my kids too and…” And I’m just sittin’ there… laying in the bed with the nerve to be upset with her. She didn’t do anything, and I’m just staring at her mouth as it’s moving, not hearing anything. I just started thinking of the news, a news story popped into my head. You know that news story, you’ll see it every year, year and a half. You’ll see some guy, never committed a crime in his life, you know, went to church every week. Helped old ladies across the street. And then out of nowhere, he just kills his wife. It’s gotta be from times like this. It just has to be. He just had something to say. Like, I don’t know, I just fucked up, but… I knew she was right, so I sat there, I fuckin’ took it, you know? I will say, as an aside, the next time you see a guy who never even cheated on his taxes, and then out of nowhere he kills his wife, I think it’s high time to bring back the question, “What did she say?” Okay? I’m just sayin’, all right? Examine the problem from 360 degrees. So anyway, so, I love my dad and everything, you know, but there’s things I want to improve on, so the great thing I have done is my kids are not afraid of me. And every time I have fucked up, I’ve gotten down on my kids’ level and let them know that I was wrong and I apologize. So, the great thing is my kids are not afraid of me. So now, my daughter’s a little bit older, she’s like four and a half now, so now whenever I start flipping out, she actually has been helping me to stop. ‘Cause the second I hear that cute voice, I can’t… I just think, “Dada, I sorry,” I just immediately… It’s hilarious, I’ll be in the kitchen. I’m always in the kitchen doing something, right? And one day I just come in like, “What the fuck kind of toaster is this?” “What was wrong with the other toaster?” “I need to download the app to make fucking cocksucking…” And all of the sudden, she’ll just be like, in the other room, be like, “Dad, don’t scream like that!” The second I hear that voice, I’m like, “You’re right, buddy, sorry.” “Sorry, I’m just gonna download the app here.” “Download the app in the amount of time it would take to make some fuckin’ toast!” Um… “Ooh, Dad, you said a bad word. You said a bad word.” She does all of that shit, right? To the point, one night… We have movie night once a week. It’s my favorite thing, we’ll watch some Pixar thing, you know. One of those great movies, you know. They’re great. They’re for kids and adults. It’s fuckin’ awesome. We sit down, make the popcorn and everything. So we have this smart TV in the living room. Oh, people, this is a smart TV. Oh, is it smart. Oh, is this fuckin’ TV. It’s so goddamn smart that one time I was in there, I had all the lights up because we were gonna watch a movie, but the TV’s so smart, as I’m pressing “on”… which you don’t even do. Don’t hit the “on” button. You hit the “on” button, that fucks it up, you gotta press two other buttons. “Oh, is that what I gotta do? Is that what I have to fuckin’ do?” “Don’t scream like that.” “You’re right, buddy.” This fuckin’ thing, if the lights are out, will not turn on, ’cause it’s thinking, “Well, the lights are out, obviously nobody is in the room.” Well, maybe somebody’s asleep on the couch and they rolled over onto the remote. Meanwhile I’m standing in the dark, “You’re gonna turn on ’cause I fuckin’ bought you and I fuckin’ said so,” right? So my kid comes running. She’s like, “Dada, don’t scream like that.” I’m like, “You’re right, buddy. I’m sorry.” She’s like, “Dada, why do you scream like that?” “‘Cause I paid all this money for this TV.” “I wanna sit down and watch the movie with you, and every time I go to turn it on, it won’t turn on.” “It’s always something.” So she put her little hand on my shoulder, she goes, “Dada, it’s gonna be okay. It’s gonna be okay.” Right? I don’t even think she knows what that means. I just think she knows when to say it, because my wife always says that. “Honey, it’s gonna be okay, just relax. We’ll get you another balloon.” “We can get you another one.” So that’s what she did. She was just going, “Dada, it’s gonna be okay.” Right? She had that little cute hand on my shoulder. And I don’t know, it just hit me, I was just thinking like, yeah. You’re right, it is going to be okay, right? “I mean, I could turn the lights on.” “I can relax. I don’t even need to watch it.” “As long as I’m hanging out with you, this is great.” It was like a profound moment for me for like half a second. Then another moment, then I felt like a loser ’cause I’m like, how fucked up am I that a four-and-a-half-year-old is, like, my life coach, like, dropping these truth bombs on me? So… anyway. So I’m going to try to stay sober until I figure out… Yeah, dude, it fuckin’ sucks, though, I’m not gonna lie to you. Just every day, takin’ life in the face. Praying for sleep. Oh, God, make it end. Fuckin’ hate these happy sober people. “It’s amazing, I feel so alive. I have all this fuckin’ energy.” How long does that take, you know? I drink a milk shake once a week, that’s my big fucking thing. Have a root beer float, oh, it’s just sad. It’s just a sad thing, like watching an old athlete that can’t run anymore. “I used to day drink, man, it was great.” So… Anyway, um… By the way, I haven’t even mentioned how blown away I am that I’m playing in this place. This is absolutely great. [audience cheering] Yeah. It’s hilarious. You stay up here for like an hour with this wind, your fuckin’ lips get all chapped. It’s like you’re standing on the front of a boat. So, anyway, let’s end with a couple of silly ones here. We’ll be on our way, right? Let’s see what I did. All right, I’m doing good here. All right, so, here’s a good one for you. A couple of years ago, before all this stupid fuckin’ pandemic shit started, Mother Nature’s half-assed attempt to get rid of the amount of people she needs to get rid of, you know, just procrastinating, treating it like a term paper. Um… I was in New York, I had an acting gig. I was playing a fireman. All right, now, I’m not the best actor, right? Some of you saw it. I hope you paid for it, you cheap bastards. You all watched it for free, you bastards. So, anyways, I’m not the best actor, so I have to look the part, so I grew this giant fireman mustache, big stupid fireman mustache, which looked great when I was wearing the whole fireman getup, and they put the fake dirt on my face. I looked like I’d been fighting fires for 20 years, right? However, the second I took off the costume and they cleaned off my face and I put on my regular clothes, I immediately just looked like some sad old queen that never found love, right? And as luck would have it, I was in New York City in June, which I quickly found out was Gay Pride Month. The whole month. And let me tell you something, the gay guys show up strong. It is wall-to-wall, the fuckin’ island is almost tipping over, there’s so many of them. And I’m sitting there going, “Oh, my God.” Thirty days of this shit. I’m walking around with this orange Freddie Mercury fuckin’ dick broom on my face. I am gonna be getting harassed up and down the street. I was in actor shape, man, I was fuckin’ shredded. I gotta tell you something, man, when I tell you 30 days of June, not one gay guy even fuckin’ looked at me. Forget about even hit on me. I have never felt so old and undesirable in my life. Dude, I’m gonna tell you something, there’s one thing as a man when you get so old that women don’t look at you anymore. Like, you know you’re gonna hit that age, you know that day’s coming, but nobody tells you, at some point, you’re gonna get so old, not even a man wants to fuck you, right? Dude, that is a statement. When you get so old, some queen in his sixties is, “Keep it movin’, I can do better than that.” “Jesus Christ.” “Get some fuckin’ hair plugs or something. Get a spray tan.” “I can get someone in his forties. Come on, keep going.” Dude, I was having this fuckin’ panic attack. I was thinking like, “Oh, my God, I waited too long to get married.” “I had kids too late, I’m gonna die soon.” I was literally wrapping up my life, you know? So I’m walking down like Ninth Avenue, putting a little swish in my fuckin’ step, just tryin’ to get something. I was desperate. Fuck you, ladies, you’ve been there. You know how it is. You wanna think you got one more in ya, you know? So I’m tra-la-la-ing down the street. I really wish that wasn’t the truth. So I’m going down Ninth Avenue, and all of the sudden I looked up, and about two blocks away, I see this lesbian coming up the block. Okay? Now, I know this is Boulder, Colorado, right? So you guys are all like, “Fuckin’, hey, man, you know?” Like, “How did you, like, know she was a lesbian, man?” “Like, that’s not cool.” “You just looked at her and you just knew she was a lesbian?” “You don’t know her, how did you just…” “How do you just know somebody’s a lesbian?” Easy. The same way you do. The same way other lesbians do. It’s not calculus. No, but I understand in 2021, you’re not allowed to say you know “what a lesbian looks like,” right? Judging by your silence, yes, right? Yeah, you’re not allowed, right? What’s funny, if some white kid came in here, like 20 years old, hair slicked back, collar popped, loafers, no socks, you’d be looking at him thinking, “All right, frat boy, date rapist.” “His dad’s a judge. He’s not going to jail.” “Yeah. Just killed five people in a drinking-and-driving accident.” “Already has a new Dodge Challenger on the way.” Right? Yeah, you’re allowed to see that, that you can see. Clear as day. Lesbian. I have no idea. No, but that’s how progressive you guys are. Right? You don’t have any idea. Right? Like, let’s play a game. I’ll just name different people you see and see the slides that come into your head, right? Construction worker. Sports fan. Painter. Skateboarder. Lesbian. Right? It all goes blank. Is that a lesbian? Am I a…? I mean, I have gay friends, but I’ve never noticed any sort of a throughline. Listen, people, I’m not saying all lesbians look alike. I would never say some ignorant shit like that. However, I am saying, though, every once in a while, there’s a fucking layup. Right? Flattop, wallet chain, fuckin’ walking up the street. Right? But even then, I’m not saying 100%. But gun to my head, I gotta go lesbian. Gotta go lesbian. Final answer, final answer, show me “lesbian.” Right? So, anyway… She’s fuckin’ walkin’ up the street. I’m comin’ down, right? And it’s clear to me that if we keep walking the way we’re walking, we’re gonna bump into each other. I don’t wanna bump into a woman, I don’t want to bump into anybody in New York, so I do the gentlemanly thing. I clock what’s going on, so I just gradually shift over into my lane. Now everything’s fine, right? But then the weirdest thing happened. We walk like another 30 yards, and all of the sudden, she drifts back into my lane again. And I’m sitting there walking like, “Wow, that was kind of crazy.” “Thought I solved this problem.” All right, so I fuckin’ dip into another lane again. Okay, I’m walking, we go another 30 yards, she comes back into my lane again. So now I’m up against the curb. So now I’m thinking, how do I do the politically correct math here? What am I supposed to be doing here? Am I supposed to step off into the bike lane and have some young kid on his electric bicycle come by, forty miles an hour, run me over, I go down to the pavement, knees and elbows? And for the rest of my life, every time it rains, I gotta think about this lesbian that walked me off the fuckin’ block? Is that what I’m supposed to do? Am I supposed to give up the whole sidewalk? Like, “Oh, your gayness!” Right? Or do I stiffen up my shoulder and protect my lane? Right? Now, I’m not proud of this, but I chose the latter, all right? I was like, “Look, I’m 53.” “I moved twice. I have an AARP card. I’m the fuckin’ victim here.” So… I stiffen up the shoulder and immediately I’m thinking this is gonna get crazy. I’ve never done this with a female before. This is in public, people are gonna see this shit, what’s gonna happen? But I’m not going to lie, she started closing in, she was moving, so I like leaned in, like I really got my legs underneath me, ’cause she was built like a janitor and I was not gonna get spun around. I wasn’t gettin’ spun aroun',\n",
       "  'd. Not having that on the fuckin’ logbook, right? So I lean into this shit, and at the last second, she turned her shoulder and we just missed shoulders, but our forearms still slapped together with significant enough force that it warranted a turnaround. Okay? Now, I know most of you guys drive, so I will break down pedestrian etiquette really quickly in New York City. This is the deal, if you’re walking down the street in New York, you’re walking and you just sort of brush sleeves with somebody, you don’t have to stop. Just look over your shoulder, “Sorry, man, my bad, have a nice day.” Right? Then there’s the next level. Moves up a little bit. You’re walking down the street, you actually bump into somebody, you actually have to turn around, “Sorry, I didn’t see you.” A little dojo bow, “My bad.” Whatever you have to do… “My sensei”… to keep it from escalating. And then there’s the last one. You’re just walking down the street and you hit so fuckin’ hard, you gotta turn around and go like old-school Dustin Hoffman-De Niro, like, “Hey, I’m fuckin’ walkin’ here! Huh?” “I fuckin’ moved twice, you didn’t see that?” “You drifted two times, huh?” So I turn around to have this confrontation, and let me tell you something, she never looked back. And I’m not gonna lie to you, that bugged me. That bugged me for like three days. Three days, I’m just walking around New York, “Goddamn fuckin’ bullshit, there’s no fuckin’ way you didn’t do that on purpose!” “Who does that, who drifts?” You know? And I’m feeling this anger, it’s just burning me up, and I know eventually it’s gonna settle in my chest, and then one more time it’s gonna be, “I sorry, Dada, I sorry.” It’s like I can’t do this to my daughter, I can’t do this to my kids. So I started reading up on anger. Like, “how to let go of this,” I think is what I Googled. And I found empathy. If you have empathy for somebody, you put yourself in their shoes, you can just, you know, figure out where they’re coming from, where you’re coming from, meet in the middle, so I said, here we go, let me put myself in her shoes. What would cause somebody to accidentally drift into your lane twice? You know, so I just started throwing shit on the wall. Did she have a clubfoot? No. Did she just have a stroke? Did she have Bell’s palsy of her left side? You know? Was she a mummy? Did she have a wooden leg? You know? Is she one of those fuckin’ diagonal walkers? You get behind them at the airport, they’re walkin’ too slow, you go around to the right, they start dragging their suitcase over there. You go over to the left, they’re coming back this way, you know? It’s like they just got off a ship. And everything was just like, no, no, no, cut! Right? And I was still mad. I was still fuckin’ mad. So I said, “Who gives a shit? I don’t give a fuck.” Lied to myself, said I didn’t give a fuck, you know? So then I ended up going home. Then I’m washing the dishes, which is a very Zen-like thing to do. It’s a week later, you wash dishes, you’re not thinking of anything. Your brain is empty, I’m washing the dishes, and then all of the sudden, the answer just came to me. It just floated into my head, and I just looked up. I was like, “Oh, my God. I know why she did it.” I know why she bumped into me. She bumped into me because she’s a lesbian. It was right there. I was, like, looking nine miles down the street, looking under shrubs. It was right in front of my face. She did it because she’s a lesbian. All right, so judging by most of your silence, I will do this math for you, come on. Let’s have a little empathy here. Put yourself in a lesbian’s shoes, all right? Who do lesbians date? Women. Who do they move in with? Women. Who do they get in relationships with? Women. Who do they eventually marry? Women. And I was thinking like, “Oh, my God. I did that.” I know what the fuck that’s like. I know what it’s like to live with one of those fuckin’ things. I know exactly what that… it’s hopeless. Trying to make them happy. “Hey, I bought you this shiny thing. Did I do it right, huh?” Trying to get them to take responsibility for their actions. Not gonna happen. The best you’re gonna get is, “I’m sorry, but…” I know what it’s like to be winning a fuckin’ argument, you’re winning, and then they turn it around, they’re crying, you’re apologizing. You’re thinking, what the fuck just happened? How am I losing this shit? I had you on the ropes. You feel so dumb, you got to go for a walk. And you’re just thinking, how did I lose again? How did I lose again? And then you figure it out, it makes you feel stupid, and then you see some bald idiot with a giant orange mustache, you’re like, “You know what, why don’t you take some of that shit?” “You take some of that fuckin’ anger.” Yeah. I feel so stupid that I got mad at that woman. I shouldn’t have got mad at her, I should have bought her a beer. And just listen to her troubles and had empathy and be like, “It’s not your fault. You married a woman, I did it too.” “You’re not gonna win. There’s no winning this.” Yeah. I’m telling you, if you don’t believe me, do a little people-watching. Take a look at the look on the average lesbian’s face. I don’t mean a lesbian in her twenties, she’s got her life ahead of her, she’s got Christmas in her eyes, right? I mean, a lesbian about 35, 36, starting to settle in to what the deal’s gonna be, right? And then look across the bar, find a married guy about the same age. Look at the look on his face. Look at the look on her face, go back to his face. It’s the same fuckin’ look. Yeah. And then look at gay guys. Some of the happiest people I’ve ever met in my life. They’re almost too happy. It’s like, “Hey, how’s it going?” They’re like, “Hi!” Almost floating across the room with that lack of estrogen just yanking down your fuckin’ dreams. No. Now, look, it might be a front. I’m not saying all gay guys are just blissfully happy, but it’s looking like a pretty good time to me. Dude, they’re some of the most positive people I’ve ever met in my life. Any idea you have, they support it. They’re just like, “Yes, yes, queen, yes!” “You’re fierce, you can do it!” Lesbians are up in the bar like a bunch of jaded cops. “It’s all fuckin’ bullshit.” “What the fuck was I thinking?” “U-Hauling after ten days, moving in. What the fuck was I thinking?” “She’s crazy!” No, I’m telling you, I think married men and lesbians need to start hanging out more, and we gotta put our heads together and try to solve our common problem, the women in our lives. So we can somehow attain the perceived happiness of the average gay dude out there. Yeah. So, if you believe in that shit, I’ll give you some advice. If you’re gonna expand your fuckin’ world of friends, I’ll give you some advice. You can’t just hang out with any lesbian. All right? You gotta make sure you’re hanging out with the dude in the relationship, right? And by “dude,” I’m not saying she’s manly, I’m not being ignorant. By “dude,” I just mean she’s the one that gets blamed for most of the shit. Right? ‘Cause no relationship is balanced. Somebody is getting away with more. Somebody’s drafting behind the other. It’s like a bike race. Somebody else is taking the fuckin’ weather in the face. [imitates fanfare] Right? Somebody else is fuckin’ right behind. “Oh, yeah, it really is wet.” Just kind of hiding under your fuckin’ poncho. Male-female, female-female, they-they, whatever the fuck it is you’re into. Every relationship, there’s the person that does the dishes and the person that lets them soak. Right? They don’t let them soak. They know you’re gonna do ’em. They’re just waitin’ you out. After a while, you can’t fuckin’ take it anymore. They’re just sitting there. You gotta go start doing them. Then what do they do? They sit in the other room and wait, like they don’t know what you’re doing, and wait till they hear pots and pans, and that’s when the show starts. That’s when they come running in like, “What?” “I was gonna do those!” And you’re like, “No, you weren’t. They’ve been sitting here eight hours.” “I got my hands in room-temperature water with scrambled eggs floating around.” “Don’t gaslight me, you’re a fuckin’ animal.” “You were raised by animals, get out of my sight.” “Don’t yell at me!” Right? Yes. Every relationship has the person that will take the trash bag out of the trash barrel and do a little… Tie it off and then leave it slumped against the counter. Like it took two behind the ear in a mob hit, just… And then there’s the person that actually picks it up and takes it out to the curb at night and puts it in the trash can, right? My wife’s hilarious, I love her, but she’s got some of the worst excuses ever. “Why don’t you ever take out the trash?” She goes, “I would, I’m just afraid of coyotes.” “I’m afraid of the coyotes.” It’s like, “So am I! So am I!” “They’re rabid dogs.” “They hunt in packs of twos and threes.” “You don’t do it ’cause you don’t wanna do it ’cause you know I’m gonna do it, just get the fuck away from me, please.” I’m telling you… So, anyway… I know I said a lot of divisive shit here tonight, so before I get out of here, before I get out of here, I want to… Let’s bring the room together. It’s a very divisive time. Everyone wants to feel safe. Let’s do a nice, normal, mainstream topic, so everybody can drive home happy, no fights, all right? Sound good? All right, great. Let’s talk abortion. There you go. Everybody has an opinion. “It’s my body, it’s my right.” “Well, then fuckin’ drive to Arkansas, bitch!” Right? Everybody has an opinion. As do I, and I apologize that you’re gonna have to listen to mine. Because… I’m gonna tell you right now. I have a really weird take on abortion. I’m gonna tell you that right from the get-go, okay? I’m 100% pro-choice, always have been. [women cheering] Ladies, I said it was weird. For the love of God. Stop getting in the trunk in the car. Wait till the end. You’re supposed to vet me first. Whoo! Fuckin’ feet out the sunroof. I said I had a weird take. Pro-choice always made sense to me ’cause I don’t like people telling me what to do, and I was just like, it’s your body. Who the fuck am I to tell you what to do with your body? So that always made sense. All right? However, I still think you’re killing a baby. See? That’s where it gets weird. Like, I sit on the fence and the whole thing makes sense to me. When anybody’s saying, like, “Don’t tell me what to do.” “It’s my body, my choice.” That’s right, man, she’s right. Leave her the hell alone. “Well, you’re killin’ a baby!” Well, I mean, there is that. You know? If we’re gonna be honest, that is the whole purpose of the procedure. You’re not going in there ’cause you got an earache. You’re going in there ’cause “I got a baby in me, get it the fuck out of there!” Right? You walk in with the baby, you come out without one. What happened to the baby, right? Something fuckin’ happened. So… Pro-choice people like, “Well, it’s not a life yet.” “It’s not a baby yet if…” I don’t know what they say. “Before you do it the first Thursday or the last Tuesday and you spin around one time.” They dance between the right trucks. “It’s not a baby yet,” that’s what they say, which may or may not be true. I don’t know, I’m not a doctor, but I’ll tell you, my gut tells me that doesn’t make sense. It’s not a baby yet. That would be like if I was making a cake and I poured some batter in a pan and I put it in the oven, and then five minutes later you came by and you grabbed the pan, you threw it across the floor. And I went, “What the fuck?! You just ruined my birthday cake.” And then you’re like, “Well, that wasn’t a cake yet.” It’s like, “Well, it would have been.” “If you didn’t do what you just did, there would have been a cake in 50 minutes.” “Something happened to that cake, you cake-murdering son of a bitch!” Right? Now, before all you pro-life people get excited, I think it’s great you’re killing your babies. It’s fantastic. Help Mother Nature out. There’s too many of us. It’s been 130 degrees out. Animals are going extinct. There’s plastic in the fuckin’ ocean. We don’t need any more fuckin’ people. And especially, if you’re honest with yourself, have you done anything great with your life? Is the person you’re banging doing anything great? The answer to both of those questions is no, what are the odds you’re gonna make a great person? I’m not saying you’re gonna make a bad person, you’re just gonna make another person that doesn’t go when the light turns green ’cause they’re staring at their fuckin’ phone. All right, I’m out of time. You guys were awesome. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you. This was amazing. [cheering, whistling] Thanks again. Thank you for coming out, everybody.

       " ['Air date: November 14, 2014 [Peretti opens the show with a bit of pre-taped tomfoolery. Lowering her voice to a dramatic, Christian-Bale-as-Batman-esque growl, Peretti monologues over shots of her riding a motorcycle through San Francisco, à la Uma Thurman in Kill Bill. She then proceeds to trace her “history” up to this point, which includes clips from her previous (and fictional) specials with titles like It’s Go Time! (a riff on Eddie Murphy’s brash ‘80s specials), I’m Still Tired and Why Am I Still Talking] [motorcycle engine revs] [instrumental rock music plays] [Chelsea] So many trials and tribulations brought me to this point. All the crazy years of my life stacked on top of one another in a pile of mistaken identities. I did countless hour specials where I looked like a damn fool, trying to be something I wasn’t. Ladies, who’s a whore? We all are. We just need to own it. We’re whores. I’m ugly but I’m a whore. [giggles] I’m a ugly whore. I don’t care. Sometimes I feel like everybody tripping but me. It’s go time! [cheers and applause] Go time! I’m still tired, and I got 12 hours’ sleep last night. I’m still tired. Who’s tired? Who’s tired? Who’s sleepy? I am. I know I am. [chuckles] In all seriousness though, who cares about anything? [sighs] We’ll all be dead soon. But it was time to put everything else behind me and start fresh. I trained with the best impression coach in the world. De Niro. Did you fuck my wife? Killed it, but I still had to go down Lombard Street. At last, I made it to the venue… San Francisco… My hometown Bay Area, the iconic Palace of Fine Arts. An icon within an already-iconic city, so it’s like a double whammy of iconography. I was still so far from showtime. First, I had to go through a rigorous calibration of the lighting environment on stage. This is interesting. This is interesting. I don’t know the terminology you guys use. It’s a little harsh. It’s hitting my eye a little… like, ow. Pure fire. But that wasn’t all. I also had to do a sound check. Ladies! I mean, it’s pretty good. I just want to make sure it can take the volume that I get to… like, what! [heartbeat] ♪♪ All that was left was for me to hit my knees and pray to God to thank Him for all the humility He bestowed upon me… and the supreme gift He blessed me with. I guess you could say I’m a direct vessel of God. It was time to hit the slats with nothing but the clothes on my back. I’m like a loaded weapon, and my brain is the bullet. [audience clapping rhythmically] They were already clapping for me. [chuckles] Me! Imagine that. Okay, we’re at places! Stand by, lighting cue. Spot 2, adjust your beams. You’re just off soft. Spot 1, match spot 2. We want more of a soft glow around the talent! Spot 1 and 2, follow me out to my car. [male announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, the show’s about to begin. Please silence your cell phones. No photos, no videos, and do not approach the stage with gifts. [gasps] [security guard] Let’s go. [announcer] And now, Chelsea Peretti! [audience cheers and applauds] ♪♪ Thank you so much for coming out. I’m just like you guys. I’m also a huge fan of my work, and… just really excited to see what I’m gonna do up here… uh, tonight. I am one of the greats. [audience laughs] [giggles] [audience cheers and applauds] One of the top comedians touring the country right now, so it should be a great show. [softly] You’re a clown. You’re a clown. You’re a clown. I like to always get into a stand-up… like, a stand-up stance, you know? Just… I always put my arm here so you guys will be like, “Uh-oh.” [chuckles] “Looks like this comedian’s probably gonna be telling it like it is.” I like to get you in the right zone. Oh, no, I just wish I was someone else. Honestly, I do, all the time. I wish I was a guy. You know what I mean? I just want to feel what it feels like to have male confidence, like, just that feeling, like, it just seems like it must be so amazing, like… My fantasy of what it’s like to be a guy is you wake up in the morning, and your eyes open, and you’re like, “I’m awesome!” [chuckles] “People probably want to hear what I have to say!” Does that sound accurate? “I’m probably gonna do something great today.” I’m always doubting myself. I’m like, gah-ah-ah, you know? Male comedians get to have so much fun. They get to do stuff where they talk about having sex with a girl. They’ll do a joke, “Oh, I was having sex with this girl…” They’ll act it out on the stool. Be like… [grunts] “I was having sex with this girl. I was fucking this girl. I was like…” [exaggerated sexual noises] They’re like… they’ll always use the mic as their dick. They’re like… I’m always just so blown away by their creativity. I want in, you know? So, I’ve been kind of working on my own version of this classic bit… where I just passively take it from the stool. So, in my version, um, you know, I would be like, “So, I was fucking this guy…” [sighs] “Then things got a little crazy.” [audience laughs] [chuckles] That’s my take on a classic. That’s it. That’s my take. Thank you. Thanks. [audience cheers and applauds] Thank you, San Francisco. I hate small talk. I really do. I hate, like, getting to know people. I hate all the little questions you have to ask to get to know someone. If I’m making a new friend, I just want to already be best friends. Or dating, I just want to already be deeply in love. I don’t want to have to trot through all the getting-to-know-you questions. “Oh, whereabouts do ya hail from? Where do ya hail from? I need answers!” Ugh, you know? [shrilly] “Where?” [normal voice] And then it’s like, “Oh, okay, yeah, I’ve never been to that town, but I’ve been to a nearby town, so I can kind of imagine.” [screams] I would like small talk if it were socially acceptable to make those sounds during it. [audience laughs] You’re just like, “Oh, your favorite color’s purple?” [screams] Then I would love it. I just hate that feeling when you don’t know someone, and any little thing they say, you have to stretch it out, turn it into something. They’ll be like, “Yeah, we had cats growing up. We were a cat family.” And I’ll be like, “You guys were a cat family? We were a dog family. Uh-oh, uh-oh! Controversy!” Then you find out you’re not that compatible as friends, but you still run into that random person all over town at the local smoothie shop, you know, and you have to be, like, “Oh, my God! You still exist!” They’ll always be, like, “We should do lunch!” The thing that people who hate each other do. “We should do lunch!” I always push it a little bit just to call their bluff. I’m, like, “We should rent a car and drive up the coast. Let’s buy some lumber and learn how to build. I just want to get to know you through task-based projects.” Everyone’s different, and when you don’t know each other well, you can’t read each other as well. Right? like, some people are big casual huggers. They love to hug. They come at you at a party… “Hey!” It’s annoying ’cause there’s no… I don’t really like hugging that much. like, someone I’m not that into… like, I’ll hug my lover while he’s inside me, you know? For the duration, but I’m not a big stranger hugger. I don’t really want your sweaty armpits on top of my shoulder tops. But there’s no polite way to turn it down. like if someone’s coming in… you can’t just be like, “Oh, no, thank you. I’ve already hugged someone today. Thank you.” But I kind of figured out a way that you can thwart an unwanted hug. When someone runs at you like this, you just grab their hands and you go, “Yay!” I also have some little party tricks sometimes I’ll bust out, you know, to lighten the mood at a party. I’ll go up to someone, “Hey, let me show you a party trick. Do you want to see a party trick? Relax your arms. Relax your arms.” And then I’ll just grab their neck as hard as I can, and squeeze it, make lots of eye contact. Just like, “I fucking hate parties.” I do, though. They seem like they’re gonna be so fun, parties, and then they’re just so stressful. like dinner parties, they seem… oh, dinner, food, friends. But then you get there, and it’s so much pressure to have a conversation, and everyone’s gotta pull their weight. And ba-ba, ba-ba, ba-ba. Da-da, da-da, oh, da-da. Da-da, da-da, da-da. Buh-ba, buh-ba. Is that too reductive? Then there’s always that moment where everyone runs out of shit to say, and everyone’s like… [sighs deeply] I will just panic and be like, “How much money does everyone make?” [audience laughs] “Who’s adopted?” You know. “Who’s ad… let’s find your parents.” Sometimes people will tell you, like, “If you’re… if you have social anxiety, just try to imagine people naked.” And it’s like… that sucks. That’s horrible advice. Watch this, I’ll do it. [scared scream] See? It’s too distracting. I read this woman’s magazine, and it said, “If you feel nervous at parties, here are some conversation starters.” One of the things was “wear a funky necklace.” Wear a funky necklace, and that’ll help break the ice. And I’m just like, “Why not go big?” Why not just walk into a party just dragging a dead dog? [feigns crying] You just kick the door open at a house party. Boom! [crying continues] That will get lips a-flappin’. People will be, like, “Who is that girl? How’d she get in here? How’d the dog die? Why is she wearing a cape?” [trills tongue] [audience laughs] I just got a dog. I got a rescue. – [applause] – [chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. I’m not that into the rescuer identity, you know. I feel like people who rescue dogs are very mouthy about it. They’re like, “He’s a rescue! He’s a rescue! My dog is a rescue. He would have been dead in a ditch. Then I came along…” You know? “I’m his savior. I saved him.” I feel like you’re kinda taking advantage of the fact that your pet can’t talk. Just be like, “All right, chill out though a little bit.” I wish I could text my dog. That is so irritating to me, that I could text everybody in my life that I love except my dog. And he would be the perfect person to text ’cause he’s always home. Okay? He would always be available. I could be uncomfortable at a dinner party, and just shoot him a text, like, [high pitched] “Hey, what are you doing? What are you doing, little cutie?” And then, he’d write back just like, “Nothing… As per ‘uzhe.’ What about you?” I’d just write back, “I feel awkward at this party. I don’t know what to do,” and he’d just be like, “Sniff people’s butts.” I’d be like, “Dude, that’s more your thing. That’s not something I do.” And he’d be like, “Oh, sorry, I can’t read your mind at all times. I’m just trying to help out, I’m sorry. I mean…” [sighs] “Why don’t you just lick your own butt and then try to lick them right here, like right inside their lip… right… right there.” I’m like, “Dude, once again… you’re looking at my life through the prism of your own experience. It’s, like, fucked up.” He’s like, “All right, what about try to go outside? It’s so fucking cool out there. Even if you can just look out a window for a second, I promise you there is shit you can see that no one else can see, Chelsea.” I’m like, “Dude, fuck you.” Click. Then people are like, “Are you all right?” I’m like, “Yeah, I just got in a fight with this guy. He’s a dog.” He’s well trained, though. We trained him to always sit, but on the 15th command. I think he’s able to count it out in his head. He’s very cute. He’s very friendly. He’s not a super-aggressive dog. Sometimes he’ll try to act tough. If a big dog’s coming at him, he’ll be like… [barks] Then he’ll get on his hind legs and look at me in the eyes, like, “Pick me up. Pick me up. Pick me up.” Yes, it’s everything I’ve ever wanted. But you learn a lot about people from how they are with their dogs. Ther',\n",
       "  'e’ll be some big huge dogs staring at my dog from a block away, like his whole body locks up, and then he’s walking all stiff toward my dog like this. And then, the owner’s, like, “He’s friendly. He’s friendly. He’s friendly.” I’m like, “Bitch, no, he’s not. Please reconsider all your friendships. That’s not what ‘friendly’ looks like.” I hate that when someone’s just overconfident, and it’s in direct conflict with reality. “He’s friendly, he’s friendly…” ’cause I’m so insecure I will start to just accept whatever they say. I just hate that confidence. I one time was driving on the freeway, and I saw an old man driving on the shoulder of the road, but he was going 80 miles an hour and driving so confidently that I was just like, “That’s a lane, I guess. I guess it’s a lane.” Sometimes when I get really intimidated by someone’s confidence, I have this little thing I’ll do. When they’re talking to me, I’ll interrupt them and be like, “Have you been crying?” Really works. No matter where their head is at, it really brings them right back down to earth. I feel like when girls are super-confident, walking around with confidence, most of the time it’s ’cause they think they’re hot. Most of time… “I’m hot. This is my world.” And I don’t relate to that because that’s just never been my full identity. When I was a kid, for example, the girls that I’m talking about, they were princesses for Halloween every year. They were like, “I’m a princess. I’m Pocahontas. I’m a rainbow,” you know? I realized the other day that one year as a child for Halloween, I was an old man. Okay? I had some stringy gray hair, and my dad’s old suit. I was like, “Let’s do this! I am the shit!” Everyone was like, “You’re weird.” I was a tarantula one year, okay? Just painting the scene, okay? And then me and these girls, we go off in different directions our whole lives, out into orbit, you know? And then, when your lives intersect later, it can be very strange because super-hot girls don’t understand regular girls’ lives, so they’ll give you very shitty dating advice, for example. They’ll be like, [mimicking] “Okay, he’s playing you hot and cold. Okay, all right. Let me think. Okay, Chelsea. All right, I know what you can do. Okay, just ignore him. Just ignore him for a little bit. Trust me, okay? Just ignore him, Chelsea, for a little bit.” [normal voice] It’s like, “All right, I haven’t heard from him in five months. Thanks for the hot tip.” I’m not saying I’m ugly. I hate when female comedians are like, “I’m ugly. I’m garbage.” I’m just saying that, like, when I get super-dolled-up, the best I can hope for is someone like, “Maybe she’s a philanthropist.” [echoing] Chelsea. You don’t have to do this. You don’t have to turn yourself into a punch line. You don’t have to turn all your feelings into jokes. And I don’t want to shit on hot girls either. Whatever, that’s cool. You’re beautiful, great. And there’s actually amazing things that they’re doing right now online. A lot of super-beautiful girls, they’ll… They’ll put a picture of their face online, but they’ll scrunch up their face and stick their tongue out, like… You know? And I’m always so floored by their realness. So inspiring to be so vulnerable with society. There’s also a very powerful movement going on right now on the Internet that, you know, women are kind of, coalition building in a very cool way. I’m talking about the hashtag “no makeup.” Um… You can search it if you don’t believe me, but some brave women are mustering up all their courage, and they will post a photo onto the Internet in which they are wearing no makeup whatsoever. I’m serious. But when they post the photos, they’ll always make a big announcement. In the caption, they’ll be like, [mimicking] “In the following photograph, I, Cassandra… am not wearing any makeup!” Then the whole Internet is like… [British accent] “Ooh-hoo-hoo! Oh, good lady, your bravery is unparalleled. Ooh-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! We thank you, Cassandra. Please check your DMs.” It just annoys me too because in the no-makeup photos, they never fully look shitty. Like they’re always still in the splits, in a bikini or something like, “No makeup!” It’s like, partial credit. And then the guys fall for it every time. It’s a thirst trap, it’s a trick. And there’s always some guy riding into the comments on a horse like he’s the Lone Ranger, he’s like… [imitates Western film music] He tips his leather hat. He’s, like, “Dear Cassandra, I actually think you look better without makeup.” [imitates grunting] Cassandra is like, [mimicking] “Thank you, thank you. Mission accomplished. Thank you.” If you really want to piss off a really hot girl, like a model-hot girl, go onto her social media, find a photo where she looks smoking hot, and you’re just a regular girl. Go onto her comments and just be like, “People say I look just like you.” [audience cheers and applauds] She’ll be like, “No!” Do you know that women Botox their armpits? This is an actual thing. It’s not to make them look youthful, you know. “Hi, everyone, same old me.” It’s actually to stop them from sweating, because why would you, you know, as a human? But the reason I know about it is I met a girl who did it, and she was like, “It worked. I did stop sweating out of my armpits, but I started sweating out of my butthole.” So, I’m… uh… Is that a good trade? like, kind of a deal with the devil. Then I’m imagining the guy that sees her out somewhere and is just like… “Oh, ho, ho, ho.” He’s like… [constricted laughter] He’s like, [surfer voice] “She is so fucking hot. Her armpits are bone-fucking-dry… just like I always dreamed of.” Then he’s like, “Whoa, whoa, whoa!” That’s him slipping on her butt sweat. “Whoa, whoa, whoa!” He’s like, “I’m so drawn to you, but I can’t get near you! This is a whole new kind of juicy booty.” [audience cheers and applauds] He’s a surfer. That’s his profession. Why just because you go onto the ocean on a thingy… do you have a dialect? Why just ’cause you have an athletic skill set, do you laugh like… [constricted laughter] It’s like, “Just stop making such a tight circle with your mouth… and then more laugh sounds could get out.” You’re my favorite female comedian, Chelsea! Thank you. Women lie about their age. That’s very complicated, actually, if you think about it. Lying about your age, it’s like you have to remember a different birthday, which would already be impossible for me. You have to remember the music that was popular at a time just before or after you were listening to it, I don’t even know the direction. I would always mess it up like, “I love to sock hop, I mean Tyler, The Creator. I don’t know, I’m old.” Just give up. Again, I feel like if you’re gonna create this whole alternate reality, do something cool with it, like walk into a cafe by your house and just be like… “Huh.” [chuckles] “My God. I haven’t been here in 128 years. Ain’t nothing changed. My God.” Your friends are like, “What? How fucking old are you?” And then you get to be like… [smug chuckling] Uh-uh-uh… Do you guys think it’s worse to wear a Fedora or kill 15 people? Be honest. Sometimes masculinity is so silly. Just the idea that because you’re born a guy, you have to be like, “I’m tough. I’m tough. I’m putting my foot down. I’m tough.” When you guys stomp, do your balls wiggle? Are you like, “I said no!” [trills] It’d take some of the intimidation out of it. And it’s like girls have reputations for being into the dumbest stuff, like purses, shoes, or whatever. What are guys into? Also stupid stuff, like architecture, literature, politics. Motorcycles. Motorcycles are very silly to me. I feel like, why not just unzip your pants, and pull your balls out, and then just walk around town banging pots and pans, just like… like that’s a DIY motorcycle. Everyone’s like, “Oh, okay, he’s a guy.” Men love Daniel Day-Lewis. That’s a real obsession. They love him, right? It’s like, I don’t fully… I’ve sat beside multiple guys in Daniel Day-Lewis movies where they’re just crying silently the whole movie, and I’m like, like, to me it’s like I’m watching a poem for men. I don’t understand it fully. To me, every movie he’s in he’s just like, “You are my son!” Like, that was a dead-on impression. I feel like men, they connect with it ’cause it’s like a male fantasy. They’re like, “What if I was that masculine? What if I had greasy black hair, and I was incoherent?” You know? It’s like the Marlboro Man. It’s the same reason that men love Breaking Bad. They love that show because it’s a fantasy. You’re like, “Oh, if I got cancer, I could probably rule the ghetto.” It’s like, “No, you’d probably just die of cancer. Similar.” [giggles] I just wish that we didn’t always have to live out our fantasies through TV and movies. I wish we could have a little more of our real feelings and fantasies in our day-to-day life, and we didn’t always have to be like, “How are you?” “I’m good, thank you.” Like… I always want to just go to one of my friends’ houses when I know they’re home, and just throw a brick through the window. Hear me out. Just for that moment where there’s that shattered glass hole, to see my friend’s head pop into it. like this. And then I’m on the other side like, “JK! Just kidding.” Just, like, shake it up a little bit. Or when people are standing outside of a movie theater, and after the movie, kinda talking or whatever, I always wanna go up to them and be like, [shrill voice] “Guys, we do need to keep this area clear, okay?” [normal voice] ‘Cause I feel like they’d be like, “All right. That’s that awful voice we listen to.” I hate that. How does that voice count as polite? [shrill voice] “Okay, guys! We do need…” It’s like you have so much hatred in your voice. Just ’cause you’re smiling, that shouldn’t count as polite. You should have to use the word “bitches” in every sentence if you have that much hate in your voice. Just like, “Okay, bitches, we do need to keep this area clear. Thank you, bitches.” [audience laughs] It’s cool to do a show in San Francisco. We’ve been traveling all over on this tour leading up to this, and… [cheers and applause] I can safely say that San Francisco audiences are the best audiences in the country. [cheers and applause] [vacuum cleaner roaring] Does that have to happen right now? Or could you turn it off? Thank you. Thank you so much. It is funny though, like traveling… I’m a pretty good traveler. I did get sick once. I try to avoid getting sick, and by that I mean throwing up. I hate throwing up so much. I come from a shit family, like… You know there’s two kinds of families. There’s vomit families and there’s shit families. And the way you can tell which one you’re from is when you were a little kid and you felt sick, did your parents tell you to shit or to vomit? That’s how you can tell. We were a shit family. So, I hate vomiting. But this particular early morning flight, I drank this green smoothie at the airport that they had prepackaged, and it tasted… [audience gasping] Oh, my God. That is the most fucking Bay Area response imaginable. You’re like, “No! Fuck that. Make ’em fresh, blend ’em up. [cheers and applause] Organic only.” Yes, I know, but that was what was available, I’m sorry. I had to do it. So, I got this pre-made green smoothie, and it tasted garlicky, and I was like, “That’s weird,” you know. But it was 5:00 in the morning, so I drank half of it, and then I was like, “I’m not drinking this.” Then I get on the flight. It’s a short flight, and during the descent, I start feeling like… [groaning violently] But I’m just sitting still, but that’s the feeling. I’m like, “Oh, fuck, oh, fuck, oh, fuck.” I start feeling that lip sweat. I’m like… [groaning weakly] “',\n",
       "  'Oh, no. Oh, no.” And I know I seem like a rule breaker and a rebel, but the little “fasten seatbelt” light was on, so I was like, “I can’t get up. Teacher will be mad.” So I’m just sitting there, and I’m like… and everyone around me is acting like nothing is happening ’cause they’re all guys, so they’re like, “This would involve feelings.” So, I’m like, “Ugh.” I’m looking for the flight attendant. She’s already strapped in in the back of the aircraft, just like a little hateful dot in the distance, just emanating beams of hatred as they do, and I’m like… [groaning] to no avail. So, I pull the seat pocket open, looking for the little vomit bag that’s on every flight except this one. In this case, it was not on this flight. So, while I did have the seat pocket open, I just went ahead and… [imitates vomiting] I’m sorry to my family! And of course, the guy next to me is just like, “There’s my light, okay, okay, there it is. It works, it goes on and off, that’s great.” So the flight lands, and I’m like, “I have to tell her. I can’t just walk off,” ’cause it was going to another location after that. And I’m a good person, which I like to tell people. And so, I walk back and I’m like, “Hey, girl. Uh… Hey, beautiful. There is a pile of vomit with my DNA in it, and your name written all over it.” And as I’m talking to her, I have that awful taste in my mouth, so I’m like… [imitates spitting] I spit in the sink, and she’s like, “Why would you do that?” And I’m like, “Oh, I’m sorry. I just… I was… I’m disoriented. If you could just have some compassion…” And she was like, “If you only knew. I’m one of the most compassionate people.” I was like, “When do you bust that out? I’d love to interact with that.” I was on another flight that had an emergency landing. That was terrifying. Here’s how that goes down, if you’ve never lived through it. There’s a little PA announcement, they’re like… [imitates ding] “Are there any doctors on the flight? Are there any doctors on the flight? Please come to the front of the aircraft.” And then you see a few people start walking down the aisle, and you’re like, “Oh, they must be doctors.” Then you hear, “We’re good on nurses.” That’s borderline disrespectful… to the entire nursing industry. Pretty soon they’re just like, “Anybody want to see a dead body?” Anyway, it’s cool. It sucks that we can’t just walk everywhere. I wish we could walk everywhere. We’re so dependent on so many technologies, you know what I mean? Look… [chuckles] case in point. [giggles shrilly] Are you guys silly? [audience laughs] [Chelsea giggles] I’m, like… at this point, I’m so addicted to so many different websites, and apps, and things. I’m honestly thankful when I’m in the shower. You know what I mean? Just the relief of not refreshing anything for… You know, aside from the obvious nooks and crannies. [audience laughs] Cricks and cracks. But there is some really cool stuff that we get to experience in this day and age that our grandparents never got to experience… like that feeling you get when one of your friends leaves their phone or their laptop unattended, and they do not have a password on it, like a dummy. My friend did this recently, and I saw his phone, and I was like… [gasps] I was filled with adrenaline. It’s what I imagine hunting and gathering felt like. I was just like… [gasps] “But this could sustain my spirit for two weeks!” I went onto his phone. I was just like… went onto Twitter. I’m like, “My dick hurts.” Then I was just like… [humming triumphant tune] I went onto Facebook. I was like, “My dick hurts.” [chuckles] ‘Cause I wanted it to be cross-platform, you know? I didn’t know if they were linked. And then I got to sit there and watch the comments roll in… People just like, “Dude, what’s up with your dick? We’re worried about you.” Our grandparents never got to do that. Do you guys think that comments… Internet comments are a good thing, pushing society in an even better and greater direction? It’s a leading question. It’s just weird that any news story that goes online, it’s like any shithead can just write [grunts] “Here’s my thoughts.” I wonder how is that gonna affect our society? How is it gonna shape things? I think about a young comedian starting now, anything they do is gonna go online, and it’s gonna be a million people at every stage of their development, giving them instant feedback. How’s that gonna affect their artistic journey? Imagine if some of the great minds of the past had been around during comment culture. If Einstein had been a young scientist, you know, maybe he would have posted a little theorem up on some science website, you know, just like, “E equals… I’m not sure yet.” You know. And then the first comment would have been like, “What’s up, Jew-fro?! You Jew-ass bitch! Jew, Jew, Jew, bitch, Jew, bitch, Jew.” Einstein would have just been like, “Oh, I’m not gonna do science anymore. It’s too hurtful.” Just pack up his little beakers and hit the road. Maybe get a job at Kiehl’s. [giggles] Did he use beakers? I don’t know. like, what did he do? He invented wing sauce? It’s weird there’s so much interactivity now. I was on Twitter, and someone tweeted to me, and they’re, like, “Get your thyroid checked.” And it threw my entire day into a complete ball of chaos. I’m like, “What? Why?” That’s not even someone being hateful. That’s someone who’s concerned for you. So, I’m Googling symptoms. It’s like, “Bug eyes.” I’m like, “Aah! Aah!” And sometimes you’re just gonna see shitty stuff online… like my friends in… who are also entertainers, they’ll be like, “Don’t search yourself. It’s all shitty stuff. That’s just what the Internet is, and blah-blah-blah.” But sometimes I have to do it. Sometimes I just… ’cause it’s my version of cutting. Like I just… I need to feel something sometimes. And one time I did, and I found this caricature that someone had drawn of me, and I don’t know if you can imagine what feature they may have exaggerated, but it wasn’t my big heart. I’m looking at it and I’m just like, “You know what?” And I got in the comments. I was just like, “Hey, I hope you and everyone who liked this dies.” And, uh, the artist got back to me really quickly, and he was like, [French accent] “I don’t understand. How could you say such a thing?” like he wasn’t French, but that was his energy. I’m like, “All right, take it down a notch. You’re definitely at a state fair right now.” Not to be a dick, but I’m just saying, is that really art? Can you call it art if someone can guess what you’re gonna do every single time you set pen to paper? like, no one’s going, “Oh, what’s he gonna do with this girl with the buck teeth? It’s a real wait-and-see.” Being a caricature artist, that’s basically like, “Did you hear about the school bully? Yeah, he’s an artist now. Yeah, he’s turned a new leaf, kind of.” And the guy was like, “You’re not that nice, either. You said you hope we all die.” I’m like, “All right, fair point. I hope you live forever as a caricature artist.” [chuckles] “That is my wish.” – Do you guys text and drive? – [audience whoops] [sighs] It’s really hard not to. That’s another thing. It’s like, we have this technology. It’s so hard not to use it, right? If you’re driving to brunch to meet your friend, it’s a 40-minute drive, you get a text from that friend, you see it, you’re not gonna be like, “I’ll just wait till I get there to see if brunch is canceled.” It’s like… it’s hard not to. And then you have those texting and driving PSAs that are fucking terrifying, right? They’re like, “This is the last thing Johnny ever texted before he crashed and died,” you know. And then it’s like, “‘Sup?!” And it’s like, “Was it worth it?” It’s like, “Oh, my God, no. No, it wasn’t.” Nothing we ever text is worth dying over. Unless, I mean… I’m just thinking there is some scenario like, imagine your friend’s being stalked, and the murderer… you know what he looks like. You’re driving by her house like 40 miles an hour. You see that guy running like this. He’s running up her steps like… [trills] And you don’t have time to stop, so you’re like, “Dude, the guy that’s trying to kill you is running up your steps”… Then it’s like, I don’t know. Now we’ve got a dialogue. [chuckles] Now we can reopen that file. We’ll all die of it. But I just wish… I just wish they would have a little… Just a titch more levity with that whole ad campaign. like, if just one out of a hundred of these PSAs, the last thing the guy texted was a dick pic? So, it’s like, “This is the last thing Patrick ever texted before he died.” Then it’s just a dick. And then it’s like, “Was it worth it?!” And then his ghost is just like, “Yes! It was worth it.” He high-fives the camera. “Uh! I needed her to see it!” Felt strongly about it. Anytime I see a dick pic and receive one from all across this great nation… what I think about is what brought the guy to that point. like I just think about the whole process, you know? Not thinking about just the result, I’m thinking about him taking down his pleated khakis… Something got him riled up, the pleats are popping, you know? I see him unzipping, and then I’m imagining he’s not just taking one photo, and then he’s done, you know? I’m imagining it’s gonna be a series of photos, so he’s getting different angles and whatever. Pretty soon, he’s got a phone full of dicks. Then I’m imagining him scrolling through a bunch of dicks, going like, [imitating Evil Queen] “Ooh, come to me, my pretty. Who is the fairest dick in the land?” And then, I don’t know, there’s something kind of gay about it. I just feel like it’s kind of gay. I just feel like, even if you’re a guy, liking a girl is kind of gay, you know what I mean? Like, we wear pink, and we like to smell like flowers. It’s like, “Suck a dick!” [woman] Whoo! I am in love. [giggles] No, it’s nice. It’s nice. It’s, um… [sighs] I don’t like to talk about who I’m seeing because he’s also in entertainment, but like, first name, Denzel, and he’s… He’s really cool, you know? He’s good to me. I don’t know. I’m just glad… I’m glad I’m not on the market anymore. I love it ’cause I remember talking to people, and just like… this one guy would be like getting to know me, and he’s like, “Do you consider yourself to be a positive or a negative person?” I’m like, “Oh, you stumped me,” you know? “I’m gonna go negative because I hate the question so much.” And then, there are just so many little things that will turn me off with someone, just the littlest thing. I remember that guy smiling at one point, and I could hear his smile. like he smiled, it was like… [tinks] [laughs] I was like, “Ah!” like, “Drink water! Please drink a beverage!” That shouldn’t be happening. That’s a medical problem. I shouldn’t be able to hear it when you smile. I definitely shouldn’t be able to have my back to you and be like, “Whoa”… “What are you smiling about, ya silly Billy?” Or someone just rolling a paint roller… in a tray that has about one to two drops of paint in it. Which is it? Yeah, there’s a lot of weird kinds of guys now, like there’s new genres of guys, I feel like. I’m not sure I’m into the “sensitive guy” thing that’s happening, you know, the kind of guys that are wearing these exact pants. You know, like they walk into your coffee shop… and they’re wearing a ratty cardigan and tortoiseshell spectacles, and you’re just like, “Oh, good afternoon, Professor 20-year-old.” You know? I’m not sure I’m into that. I feel like for me to see a guy be super-sensitive and find that attractive… like to see a guy cry and find it hot, the way he’d have to cry is just like… He can’t even put his arms down ’cause he’s so jacked. And the way he cries is just like… [goofy crying] l',\n",
       "  \"ike he’s almost confused by what feelings are. “What’s happening to my face? Why’d I kill so many bears?” That’s the kind of stuff he’s up to. Like Channing Tatum, you know? Ronnie from Jersey Shore, Channing Tatum, that’s my… [sighs] Like Magic Mike… Did you guys see that? – [audience whooping] – Yes! One of the best American films of our century. I did love it, though. It was such a pièce de résistance performance. Um… And I’m extremely religious, and extremely politically conservative, but I saw that movie, I’m like, “I want to fuck Channing Tatum on camera in front of his wife and my boyfriend, our families.” He just brings out that kind of openness and vulnerability. I never had that much luck with Jewish guys. I don’t know, I just feel like, you know… Some of you are gonna disagree, some are gonna agree… It’s kind of a stereotype but it is one of those ones that’s true. They definitely do really want to fuck their moms really hard. Don’t get uncomfortable. Just be like, “Oh, yeah, that’s true.” You know what I mean? It is true, and we just have to accept it. And I think that that tension of that taboo is honestly what causes all the earthquakes in California. I’m serious. I feel like if… Why don’t we just make a day where it doesn’t count, okay? Hear me out. We just make one day where we’re like, “We’re not looking, go, go, go. No one’s gonna judge you. No one’s gonna wag their finger. Just do it. It’s not gonna count.” And I actually think that would make a great movie, like Hall Pass or something, you know? And I want to pitch it to a Hollywood executive, and just feel that out, but I feel pretty sure that that executive would be like, “Um, Chelsea, we’re not gonna make this movie, but I am gonna fuck my mom. That sounds incredible.” Do you guys know that it’s illegal to make jokes about the Holocaust in Germany? Isn’t that funny? Like, to me, that’s such a fascist approach to anti-Semitism. It’s like, “You guys have learned nothing. What are you doing? Hit the books.” I always wanted to be… Tolerance books. I always wanted to be in one of those Holocaust movies where it’s like there’s the beautiful Jewess who can pass for German. And I want to play her. So, it’s just me with my exact face, but in a blonde wig. And I’m just walking around, hanging out with Hitler and his friends, and like, I see a Jew. I’m like, “Shh!” [giggles] They’re like, “What?” Everyone watching the movie is like, “This is miscast. I’m furious.” “Shh.” I was talking to my friend, and he was like, “Hitler was a good speaker.” I’m like, “What are you doing right now?” Like, do you think Hitler’s ghost is sad somewhere like, [whiny voice] “Did I do anything right? Wah… I feel like a failure.” You’re throwing him a bone like, “Here you go, Hitsy.” You know? It’s like, of course he was a good speaker. That’s part of being a dictator and creating a genocide environment. You can’t just walk out like… [constricted laughter] [surfer voice] “All right, you guys. What we’re gonna do, depending on the vibe… is grab a gypsy if you feel like it. Blue-sky thinking, but maybe kill all Jews. I don’t know. Feel it out.” Everyone would be leaving… Just like, “Mmm, Hitler, you suck.” Just tearing off their armband like it’s a shitty music festival. Why are old maps always burnt? Have you ever noticed that like every map you see from the olden times is always burnt all around the edges and in the middle? Where did they used to store their maps at? They’re like, “This is our cooking pit slash map storage unit.” [baby voice] You guys know what I’m talking about, – don’t you? – [barks] Don’t you know? Don’t you know? So, yeah, I’m in love. I’m in love. Just trying to keep leading you guys back to being okay with that, ’cause when I said it the first time, you’re like… “We’re really not here for love. Um… we’re here to laugh at your pain.” [audience laughs] [Chelsea laughs] Anyway, I don’t know. I wanna like… Now I’m in love, so it’s like I gotta figure out, “Okay, now what?” Right? The whole rest of our lives stretch ahead. Do we get [shrill voice] married? Married? [normal voice] I feel like marriage needs re-branding. Do you know what I mean? It’s like, [shrill voice] “We’re married. This is a marriage. I’m his wife, and he is my husband. Wife, husband, marriage.” [normal voice] I just feel like… I like the idea of soul mates, like being together forever, or like Bonnie and Clyde, like, kill people and die, you know? But I don’t know about marriage. The only really cool example I have is my grandparents. They were married 50 years, okay? They had this beautiful marriage. They worked their way up from nothing, they built their dream house, they had a garden together. She grew roses, he grew vegetables. It’s a beautiful marriage. And then I always tried to ask her questions about it to get some insight, like how can I have that kind of longevity and that compatibility, you know. And my grandmother will tell this story where she’s just like, “Well, the day we got married… Grandpa was driving away from the church, and I remember looking at his hand on the wheel, and thinking, ‘I don’t know this man.'” I’m like, what? That’s the story you’re passing down to the next generation? What am I supposed to do with that? Just marry a stranger? Also that’s a pretty shitty story. It has no beginning, middle, or end. It’s just, you were looking at an arm. But she’s told it to me like 25 times. “I don’t know this man.” I’m like, “What is happening?” And they had this great marriage, and then it’s like, okay… then he passed away. So now, even though they had this long, great marriage, now she kind of wanders around her house… she’s like, “Well, guess I better go turn that light off. Then I’ll go round back and turn that light off. I don’t know how all the lights got on!” [chuckles] We got her a dog. We’re like, “Here, take this.” She named it Buffy after the Vampire Slayer, which is cute. – [applause] – Yeah! All my Buffy heads. But it’s weird ’cause she projects all her own nonsense onto the dog. The dog’s just like, “Yay, I’m a puppy!” And she’s like, “Buffy don’t want to go outside. Buffy’s tired.” Buffy’s like, “Let’s go, come on! Let’s go, I’m a dog!” She’s like, “Buffy don’t want to play. Buffy’s feeling morose today. Buffy’s been off her meds for months.” We’re like, “Uh, Grandma, we still talking about Buffy?” My dad, he’s at the opposite end of the spectrum. He’s on his third wife now, so… [sighs] Yeah, cool. Um… I don’t know if you’ve ever attended a third wedding, but there is kind of a different feel to it… maybe a titch less whimsy. You kind of walk in, you’re like, “All right, hey, everyone! Same seats, or… we gonna switch it up?” Just eating cake like, “Dad, dare I say, this cake is even better than all them other cakes.” My dad’s Italian and my mom’s Jewish, then he was married to a black woman from when I was one until I left home. Now he’s married to an Indian woman for his golden years, so it’s really been just a whirlwind of scents, and spices, and silks, and colors. It’s been like some sort of a strange foreign exchange program that just kind of revolves around my father’s penis. My black stepmother, which is what we used to call her… She used to do my hair when I was a little girl, and she would always call me tender-headed. She’d be like, “Chelsea, stop moving! You are so tender-headed!” I’d be like, “Well, I’m really just more of a white person. We kind of have a two-barrette maximum… on what we’re up to with barrettes. Please stop sending me to school looking like Katt Williams. I’d like to do an impression of my dad, but I don’t have a newspaper and five hours to spare. I was so excited when this show was put in The Chronicle, ’cause I was like, “He will have to acknowledge my existence.” Don’t feel sad. Don’t be sad. Um… I’m always looking for just examples of happily married people… You know, just to see someone like, “Oh, that looks awesome.” like, looking for clues in society all the time, and how do people make it work and be fun. like, I’ll watch the “housewives” reality shows, um… just looking for a morsel of inspiration. I remember when those shows first started airing, like 18 years ago, I remember being like, “Oh, my God.” I forgot being a housewife was still an option for women. I was like, “Fuck, I should have done that!” I took a wrong turn. That is so awesome. Someone else works and then you do not work? Like, why did women ever stop doing that on any level? Why did we phase that out? Just out of dignity? I’m not trying to be rude. If any of you guys are housewives, I’m sure it’s a lot of work, but… [audience cheers and applauds] “You should be paid a wage.” No, but sometimes I look at… friends of friends on Facebook, and just kind of observe their lives to see… Do I want any of that? Is there anything I can cherry-pick out of those lives, toss it into my life and make it a better life? A friend of a friend just posted like 500 engagement photos on Facebook. It was a photoset of 500 photos. I’m not exaggerating. It’s like that wedding portraiture, where it’s just like, two assholes back to back in the woods, just like… [laughing shrilly] “To the future!” I’m just obsessed with the entire photoset. I’m just like, “Next, next, next, next, more, more, more, more.” Every photo, they were just like… [giggles shrilly] “Uh-oh, it’s us again.” [trills] This same girl on Facebook, all her posts and all her updates are about her husband. That’s all she seems to write or think about, but she doesn’t call him her husband, which would be awesome, and she doesn’t call him by his name, which would also be great. She calls him by a word that I really feel is one of the more disgusting words in the English language. She calls him her “hubby,” which, to me is on par with the “N” word. Like let’s… Let’s eradicate both. All her updates, she’s just like, “My hubby made breakfast. My hubby fixed the door. My hubby is sleeping. He breathed in, he breathed out. He breathed in, he breathed out.” I just keep waiting for the day where she is like, “My hubby shot himself in the face! His letter said he missed his name… which I just found out is Steven. Missing my hub like a mug.” You have to be so patient to be a parent, you know? My friend, her kid… We were in the park hanging out, and her kid tangled up his kite string, and she’s sitting there with it for 40 minutes like, “Okay, baby, I got it. Over and under. It’s okay, baby. I got it.” And he’s just watching, like… And I’m watching this whole operation, and thinking if that was me, I’d be like, “Oh, my God, we have to throw away your kite! Oh, you loved it. Aw…” [chuckles] [nasally voice] “That is awful. I feel so bad.” [normal voice] I just want a life that has passion. I don’t know. [sighs] I just want excitement. I want to be a good person. I want to be a good adult, have a solid life, but I also want passion and unpredictability. Not like Jodi Arias level, but like something. Are you guys following that… The Jodi Arias? [scattered applause] Cool. [giggles] Me too. Me too. How crazy, we have that in common. Um, no… it’s an interesting one, right? First of all, it’s like, you know, she’s a woman, and murder is mostly a man’s game, so it’s like she kind of broke a glass ceiling in a way. It’s like… I don’t know. Feminism is so complicated. But it’s an interesting case because… [sighs] allegedly, she stabbed him a bunch… It’s her ex-boyfriend… She stabbed him a bunch of times, then slit his throat from ear to ear, then she shot him. It’s like, “Mmm, pick a thing,” you know. In that regard, she really was like a typical girl, where she’s like, [mimicking] “I can’t decide. I’ll have all the desserts.” Well, cong\",\n",
       "  'ratulations, guys, on you all just coming out of your houses tonight. That’s so hard to do, isn’t it? [applause] So hard. I hate leaving my house. I’m always amazed when people do it. I’m the happiest when I’m just on my couch, under my blankets, just all cozied up with just my laptop, and my iPhone, and my iPad, and my pee jars everywhere. Just playing bongos on my pee jars. Happy as a clam in my little kingdom. Do you ever do one chore, and then celebrate that for ten years? Or you have a pile of dirty dishes in the sink in the next room, and you hear water, one drop drop into it, just like, “Bloop.” And you’re like, “I know!” That’s my kind of household, but I love it. Sometimes I feel like if these walls could talk, they’d be like, “Bitch, you’re back in bed again?” I’d be like, “Shut up, walls! You’re boring, too.” [chuckling] I do hate it. I hate leaving my house ’cause I have to pee constantly, and I hate asking people… I hate asking people, [nasally] “May I use your restroom?” I hate that, like, [shrilly] “Please, may I?” [normal voice] It’s just so humiliating to ask a business to use their restroom. And I pee all the time. I told my friend that. I’m like, “I pee all the time,” and he’s like, “You’re a frequent urinator?” I’m like, “Um, don’t put a medical flair to it. I pee a lot, okay?” And he’s like, “Is it sticky pee? like, is it like syrup?” I’m like, “No, motherfucker.” How crazy would I have to be that I have sticky pee, and I’m just walking the earth… like I’m just like, “Uh-huh. Yeah, I do, I have sticky pee. Why, what’s up? What’s up? What’s up? What is it? What’s on your mind? What’s the deal? My pee… yeah, it’s like molasses, why? Why do you ask? Just wondering why you ask.” You know. It’s like… if I had molten pee, like, I would be in an ambulance right now. I don’t like peeing in public. I hate that feeling of like, someone being so close to you. I don’t know if you guys do this, but I will actually tilt and try to pee on the side of the toilet bowl ’cause it flattens it and then it’s seamlessly injected into the toilet water, completely silently. And then no one can ever know how forceful my pee stream is. That’s too much intel for a stranger. They’re like, “Chelsea pees like a horse.” It’s like, no. Putting my foot down. I just panic… like, what if I let go, and it’s that kind of lawn-sprinkler pee, you know, that pulsating… Where it’s like… [makes whooshing sounds] Then all of a sudden, you gotta make a joke to your stallmate. You’re like… [forced laughter] “Club music!” I can’t take this stress. like, I’d rather just hold it. I don’t even like eating in front of people. That stresses me out, to be honest with you. I hate the feeling… I don’t want to eat on a business lunch, and I don’t want to eat on a first date. It’s an animal thing… I can’t chew confidently, like… [imitates chewing] You know? My instinct as an animal, when I see meat on a plate, I just want to pick it up and then just drag it off down into a dark hole somewhere, just… [makes gnawing sounds] That’s how I think restaurants should be, just jet black with dirt holes around the perimeter. Just like throw a pan in there. My ideal eating situation is just me in a ditch with a buffet in it. Okay? With no one around for miles, just the wind and the treetops. I’m just naked. I’m just like, “Mmm. Shrimp, shrimp, shrimp, cake, cake, cake. Shrimp cake, why not?” [grunts] And I’m not saying this in a Cathy cartoon way. I’m saying this in a River Monsters way, okay? A Game of Thrones feast. That’s how I want to eat. Just like Sizzler right when the apocalypse hits. That would be my absolute dream. I don’t like eating bananas in public. That is so stressful if you’re a girl. It’s so annoying ’cause it’s such a portable, good snack, but if you’re a girl and you want to eat a banana on the bus or wherever you may be, all of a sudden you’re in the position of like, how do I de-dick this delicious treat, so that I may enjoy it without people imagining me blowing them, you know? So, I have a system again, and I think a lot of us do this. What you do is you peel it, right? Then you break a piece off, right? Then you mash it up in your palm into a paste, and you push it up between your fingers and eat it like… [trills] [laughs] [trills] Right, ladies? ‘Cause you don’t want it to look sexual. That’s a no-no in society. I actually just got some bad news. I just found out I’m allergic to gluten-free food, so it’s a nightmare. It’s gonna be hard to eat in this century. Do you guys know… Speaking of pigging out, do you know that a female pig’s orgasm lasts supposedly for 30 minutes? Ask your mom. That’s a great spirit in here. Honestly, sometimes, I look out at the audience, and I’m just like, “Fuck, I wish I was you.” You know? Just sitting there totally just like, “What’s next?” You know, just totally relaxed, just watching a genius, you know. Just seems like a fun time. Do you guys ever fantasize about having a job other than your own shitty job? like, for me, I do it all the time. For me, what my fantasy job is… is to be a florist. I really feel in my heart of hearts, if I was a florist, I would be happy all the time. It would just be 24/7 nirvana, and I would always have my hair just kind of loosely piled on my head, you know, with just some chopsticks through it, and just long skirts and bangle bracelets, just like… [imitates clinking] And then I would talk to all my customers just really soothing, like, [quietly] “Let me put some extra baby’s breath in there for you.” [giggles] It actually calms me just to pretend to be a florist. “Okay, these will look really nice. That’ll fill that in really nicely for you. There you go. And I’ll put a little ribbon on it. [indistinct] I think that would be really nice.” It makes me feel so good, I should do this every night. “All right, there you go.” And then I feel like, in my fantasy, all my customers would be really handsome male architects ’cause that’s like the perfect guy job, and when I was done making the bouquet, they’d take it and turn it around and be like, “It’s actually for you.” You know, that’s my fantasy of what it’s like to work in the floral industry. I’m sure I’m idealizing it. If I actually got into that field, I’m sure someone would just be like, “That’s not a daffodil, you cunt.” You know. [audience laughs] It’d be a rude awakening. That’s my fantasy. It’s weird being on TV now because then it’s like stand-up… When you do stand-up, it’s all about being relatable. You want to go, “Okay, here’s what my day was, here’s what’s going on,” and people are like, “Oh, I’ve done that, too.” Then you get on TV and weird stuff starts happening in your life. You start going, “Is this relatable?” You know, like… [sighs] For example, nothing really feels like it costs anything anymore. Is that relatable? [audience laughs and applauds] [Chelsea giggles] No, I do love stand-up. I think it’s just cool that you get to say your feelings, and it’s this completely unmoderated experience. like any song you’ve heard, that’s the same thing. That’s just that songwriter’s point of view on what was happening. I always have that Michael Bolton song stuck in my head, where it’s like… ♪ How can we be lovers If we can’t be friends? ♪ ♪ How can we start over When the fight never ends? ♪ ♪ Oh, baby, how can we? ♪ Anyway, yes, yes, it’s a great song. We all love it. [chuckles] I think we can agree. But that’s just maybe Michael Bolton’s take on whatever was going on in that relationship with that girl that he was singing about. Maybe that wasn’t her issue with Michael Bolton at that time at all. like, maybe her song to him would have just been like… ♪ Your hair kind of hit me In the face when we fucked ♪ ♪ I just didn’t like it That was more my issue ♪ [audience laughs] That’s so funny how you know every word to a song, and then, it’s like, maybe ten years in, you realize what it’s actually about. You realize the lyrics, what they’re actually meaning, you’re like, “Oh!” You know? I was thinking about that Dr. Dre song from the ’90s, where it’s like… ♪ Bitches ain’t shit But hoes and tricks ♪ I’m like, “If you actually look within the lyrics… that song is actually not that complimentary to females.” [laughs hysterically] You guys have been really cool. You know, uh… have you? I don’t know. Um… [chuckles] Sometimes when I do interviews, which is constantly, people will ask me, you know, “You’re a woman and you do comedy. Question mark.” like, that’s the whole question. And I never know what to give them, what they want. I don’t know how to describe what it’s like. The best I can do is like, you’re up on stage, and you’re telling jokes, and the whole time, in between your legs, you have a pussy. Sometimes the jokes are going great, you still have one. Other times they’re going… ugh… you still have that same set of genitals. It’s like it’s haunting your every move… no matter what ideas you might be expressing. It’s creepy. like, watch… [grunts] still there. So scary. It is weird being a female comedian ’cause you do hear people talking shit all the time. like, “Fucking female comedians, dude, they fucking suck. All they do is talk about their fucking period, man. Fuck that shit. I have discerning taste. I like fart jokes mostly.” [chuckles] Or whatever their taste may be. But it just annoys me ’cause I have never… just because of that, I’ve never talked about my period the whole time I’ve done stand-up ’cause I don’t want to give anyone the satisfaction. But what annoys me is just on principle, because I guarantee you, if guys got their period, all right? Just make that jump. If guys got their period, there’s no way a male comedian would be standing on stage right now bleeding out of his dick, okay? Just like bleeding, and he’s just like, “I’m not gonna talk about it. I’m not gonna do it. It would be déclassé. I don’t want to disrespect comedy like that. I said no.” You know? If guys got their period, 90% of stand-up comedy would just be people running around like, “I was bleeding out of my dick! What the fuck?! Drip, drop, drip, drop, drip, drop, drip, drop!” Thank you guys very much. [man coughs] [snores] [soft music plays] [instrumental rock music plays] I found a caricature that someone had drawn of my face and I don’t a-know… And I don’t a-know… [laughs] I don’t a-know. Show the audience you’re having a soda. [imitates soda can opening] [burps] Men love Daniel Day-Lewis, you know? [audience whoops] Hoisting my pants. Should I say that again? Or should I just keep all this in? [grunts] [man] This isn’t funny. Can I have my money back, please? It’s not funny? You want your money back? All right. – [click] – [whirring] – There you go, toots. – Great, thanks. – Are you guys awake? – [audience laughs] Just checking in. This will be my life dream. Uh… just making sure you are with me here, as I do perform my jokes for you tonight. Thanks for checking in. I will go off-book. As you can see, I will go ahead and personally attack each and every one of you. [laughs] Your email address will not be published.

       " ['[indistinct chattering] [faint laughter] [audience cheering and applauding] Oh! What the fuck, Boston? Goddamn! Thank you. It’s good to be here. Good to be back. Fuck! I love it. Goddamn it! Good to see happy people… having a good time. It’s a tense world we’re living in today. You got a president that’s threatening to fight an ex-vice president. [laughter] You pay attention to that shit? It’s a couple weeks ago on Twitter. Donald Trump said that if he fought Joe Biden, Joe Biden would go down fast and hard. [laughter] I want to get in his ear. I’ll be like, “Let’s make this happen, bro.” [laughter] There’s money on the table. I’ll commentate for free. [laughter] No rules, grow your nails out, wear a diaper. No clothes. To the death. [laughter] Fuck it. Let’s bring this thing totally down. Seems like every day you turn on the news, more and more crazy shit. When are we going to realize we shouldn’t have a fucking president? It’s a ridiculous idea to have a popularity contest to see who controls everything. Because if you could go back in time and grab Thomas Jefferson and bring him to 2018… his first question would be… “You guys didn’t write any new shit? [laughter] Dude, I wrote that with a feather. [laughter] I did it by fire! That’s the only way I could see what I was writing! You lazy fucks! You guys have phones in your pockets and spaceships! ‘But the wisdom of the scroll shall not be adjusted.’ What the fuck does that even mean? Who told you that, bro?” [laughter] We always like to say, “The long, great history of the United States.” Listen, that’s not real. The United States was founded in 1776. People live to be a hundred. That’s three people ago. [laughter] You’re like, “Is he right?” Yeah! The Fear Factor guy just hit you with a fucking math quiz! [laughter] Three people ago! Listen to me, you’re not going to get this from teachers. We used to be monkeys, and we found mushrooms, and now we’re different. And it’s real, real recent. [laughter] No one knows what’s going on. Three people ago, slave owners made boats out of trees, and used the power of the wind to drift across the ocean. They didn’t have a YouTube video to watch first. They didn’t talk to a travel agent. You know what they had? A drawing. Some guy went there and drew it. [laughter] Like, “Are you sure that’s what you saw?” “That’s what I saw! You callin’ me a liar?” And they had a gunfight in the dirt streets. They were fucking savages just three people ago. They took their baby and jumped on a boat and floated across the fucking ocean with their kids. Animals. That’s us. It just happened. Real recent! “I just never saw Trump coming.” Well, you don’t pay attention to trends. We have a very clear trend in this country. We try one person as president, and the next person has to be completely opposite. ‘Cause no one can do the job correctly. So we let someone try it and we’re like, “He fucked it up.” We go with this guy who’s totally different, who’s got our interests in mind. And we always do the same thing. We go right, left, dumb, smart. We give everybody a chance. [laughter] We go Clinton, Bush. Then we go Bush, Obama. Obama, Trump. We just got out of a long-term relationship with a very boring but sensible person, and now we’re dating a whore. [laughter] [cheers and applause] All right? She’s got fake hair. She’s racist. She’s always lying. We don’t care! We’re not trying to start a family, we just want to run red lights and fuck. [laughter] All right? [applause] For real. We don’t know what we’re doing. If this country was a person, we’d be on coke, driving a yellow Corvette, singing Mötley Crüe songs in front of our ex’s house. [laughter] We’re going crazy! [laughter] “Well, it would have been so much better if Hillary won.” [moans] [audience cheers] “Oh, we got so close!” “Oh! We almost had a woman!” Oh, girls, relax. I think a woman can be president. But let’s not use a lying old lady who faints a lot. [laughter] I think you can do better. It’s not that I don’t think a woman can be president. I’m fucking sure a woman can fuck it up just as bad as the men that fucked it up. No one’s going to do it right. But if Hillary Clinton was my own mom, I’d be like, “Mom! You can’t be president. You can’t stand up fast.” [laughter] “I’ll show you! One ring to rule them all…” [groans] [laughter and applause] [in a woman’s voice] “Oh, you’re sexist! I see, you’re sexist! As well as short. You’re fucking sexist!” Ugh! Defuse my point of view. I am sexist. But I’m sexist against men. I decided during this whole Harvey Weinstein thing. This is why. That’s when I realized I was… I had some suspicions… that I might be sexist before that. [laughter] That’s when I really decided. ‘Cause what Harvey Weinstein did, it was fucking terrible. Can you imagine being an actress? You gotta fuck that guy in order to make it. Like, ugh. What a horrible choice. Like, what a terrible position to be in! “This is the only way?” That sucks. That’s fucking… That’s criminal. I think that guy’s a piece of shit. I think he should be punished. But! [laughter] If he had done the exact same thing to men, I wouldn’t give a fuck. [laughter] I wouldn’t even be slightly upset. [laughter] If I was reading the morning paper and I read a story about a bunch of dudes who let Harvey Weinstein fuck ’em… [laughter] -so they could be in superhero movies… [laughter] I’d read that, I’d go, “Ha-ha!” [laughter] What else? What else is happening? [chuckles] [laughter and applause] I wouldn’t be clamoring for justice. [audience member] Woo! [laughter] If Harvey Weinstein was a woman who looked like Harvey Weinstein… [laughter] and she did the exact same shit to men, my only question would be, “Hey! How bad you want to be Batman? [laughter and applause] How long is it going to take, bro? You could wait tables in this town for 20 years and never catch a break. Or you give the nice lady what she wants. [laughter] Jude Law is in the waiting room and he’s wearing a lobster bib. You tell me… [laughter] if you want to be a winner. [laughter] They don’t fucking give Ferraris away, son! They make ’em by hand.” [laughter] If Harvey Weinstein propositioned my daughter and offered her a movie role in exchange for sex, I, like every other parent in this room, would want to fuck him up. But if Harvina Weinstein… [laughter] came to my son with a solid contract… [laughter] I’d be like, “Dude, you’re gonna be Batman. [laughter and applause] Yes, you are. [cheers and applause] [whistles] Hey, no crying! Batman doesn’t cry! Come on!” “Your own son? Really?” Jaaaaa. What’s the worst thing that can happen? It’d be a harder job. It’d be hard to please Harvina. [laughter] Right? Rich old lady, it’s probably real hard to make ’em come. You gotta make eye contact, you gotta lock in with them. They got to know you’re involved in this project. Right? Rich old ladies are probably super skeptical. [grunts] [laughter] Look. Always, always maintain eye contact. That wouldn’t be the hard part. The hard part is, when you go down on Harvina, she likes to rest her fat gut on your forehead. And the sweat! The sweat gets in your eyes! And it stings like sunscreen! But you gotta keep ’em open ’cause you want a Ferrari! Aah! Aah! [laughter] Nobody cares. Nobody cares about boys that have to eat pussy. No one cares. [laughter] We’re all sexist against men. No one cares. No one feels bad. [faint laughter] “How’d you get that car?” “Man, I had to eat pussy for it.” “You gonna be okay?” [laughter] Feel bad for you. [Joe laughs] [laughter] Look, I get it. Men are gross, ladies. I’m on your side. My favorite example of the difference between the way men and women are treated was always old school Fox News. I used to watch it without the sound on, so it’s almost like watching a wildlife program, just watch them move around. I was watching it once and Megyn Kelly was on, and she was on with Bill O’Reilly. They were right next to each other, so I assumed they were in the same climate. But Bill O’Reilly was dressed like there was a chill in the air. He had a jacket on, a shirt, a tie, and pants. And Megyn Kelly was wearing what would best be described as a vagina curtain. [laughter] Not a good curtain either. Not like one of those Vegas curtains that lets you sleep in late. No, no, no. No, this curtain is like that curtain that sits over Grandma’s kitchen sink. You know that one? [laughter] Kind of flutters in the breeze. You could always see the yard. You know that one? And Megyn Kelly’s on TV with smooth, slippery skin that doesn’t exist in nature outside the dolphin community. [laughter] You’d see her toes. You’d see her feet and her toes. She could just kick off her shoes and there’s a Dorito-sized piece of cloth keeping you from the greatest show on earth. And it’s right there. She knows it’s right there, you know it’s right there and no one’s saying a fucking word. And if she disagrees with you, she’ll adjust the curtain and switch her legs. Hmm. [faint chuckles] Hmm. Nobody says nothing. If I was talking to a dude… and he didn’t have any pants on… [laughter] and he kept switching his legs back and forth… I’d be like, “Hey, man. Are we cool? [laughter] Where the fuck are the rest of your clothes? Why you so itchy? Where’d you get those shoes?” No one says shit while Megyn Kelly’s over there trying to start a fake tan fire in her pussy. [laughter] [blows air] [a clap, laughter] It’s weird. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with it, but it’s weird. She doesn’t have any sleeves on. Where are your sleeves? [laughter] That’s not weird? It’s not weird, it’s strange. “I want you to respect me.” I want to respect you, but you’re half-naked and I want to fuck you, so I’m confused. I don’t know what to do. I’m thinking of saying anything you want. Whatever you want me to say, I’ll say it. I want you to like me more. That’s the problem with a woman that’s that beautiful and super smart. You know she’s smarter than you. She’s a lawyer. She never says “um,” she’s smart as fuck. [laughter] And she’s really, really, really pretty, and she doesn’t have a lot of clothes on. She’s gonna get her way. All right? [laughter] You won’t tell her to go fuck herself. You’ve to be super secure to do that. And you can see some of her tit. [laughter] That’s weird, right? If I came here like this, you’d be like, “Joe, what the fuck are you doin',\n",
       "  'g, man?” [laughter] Right, but if Megyn Kelly’s on TV, “Oh, she’s just got a cute shirt on. It’s just cute. It’s cute.” You could see some tit. You could see some middle tit. You might even see some side tit if you catch… if she’s pointing at something, she might just… “I didn’t even know you were looking at my side tit.” She’ll just pretend. But long as you don’t show the dirty, dirty dark skin. [groans] There it is! [cheers and laughter] The sensitive, forbidden skin! Put it away! It’s not for strangers! [laughter] That’s fucking strange, ladies. Listen, don’t listen to me. I’m a moron. Wear what you’re wearing, it looks great, but it’s weird. You can show some of a sex organ. What if that was the case with dudes? What if we had a window in our pants, we could just see the shaft? [laughter] Right? Just the shaft. [laughter] You can’t see the head of my dick, I’m not a creep. [laughter] Okay? Just a little side dick. [laughter] You have cleavage, we have tubage, it’s no big deal. It’s whatever. Just showing a little tubage. Why do I dress like that? To look cute for my friends. Okay? God! You’re so fucking jealous. I need to get a sip of water. Excuse me for a moment here. [Joe clears throat] I probably should’ve taken this onstage with me, but I’m trying to be cool. That’s that cotton mouth, son. [laughter] [sniffs, clears throat] Woo! [cheers and applause] Yeah, you guys are legal now. I grew up here. We used to hide in the bushes and smoke weed. Ridiculous. Hiding from cops that are now getting high. Going, “What do I do to all those fucking kids? Hoo-hoo-hoo.” [laughter] The real problem is the laws. And Massachusetts finally has good laws. We’ll be able to understand… [cheers and applause] what pot actually is. Florida’s got the craziest laws, ’cause Florida’s trying to protect their pain pill industry. So in Florida, they make it so illegal, this is one of the things they do in Florida: they hire undercover cops to pretend to be high school students. Specifically a hot woman. They hired a 25-year-old hot woman to pretend to be a high school student, flirt with boys, get those boys to sell her weed, and then arrest them. [faint laughter] I don’t like to use the word “cunt.” [laughter] When I use it, I want it to mean something. That’s a cunt. That lady’s a piece of… fucking human garbage. You fucking asshole. Here’s the thing. [laughter] Not only is it not fair, that is one of the most sexist stories you’ll ever hear. Here’s why it’s sexist. It’s sexist against boys. Here’s why. You could never imagine that story if the genders were reversed. If you found out that a 25-year-old man was throwing dick at your 17-year-old daughter, and he talked her into selling him weed, and then he arrested her, we would light that motherfucker on fire in the street. Right? [cheers and applause] But if it was my own son who got arrested by that cop, I’d be like, “How’d it go? [laughter] Tell me what happened. Record? You’re worried about your record? You got a story, dude. You got a… You’re the first guy ever to get arrested by an undercover cop you thought was his girlfriend. [laughter] That’s a fucking hell of a story.” Some people are, like, hard asses about it like, “Shoulda known better. He’s almost 18.” Yeah, but he’s almost 16 too. [laughter] Which is almost 15. That’s like a little kid. Do you remember what you were like when you were 17? You didn’t know what the fuck was going on. And this kid wasn’t even a drug dealer. This kid, it’s not like he got caught. No, this kid was a straight-A student that thought he was getting pot for his girlfriend. He even tried to give it to her. She wouldn’t accept it. She wanted to give him money, so she could arrest him. But he had to know, he was a smart kid. He had to know. He had to know something was off. ‘Cause here’s what it’s like: a 25-year-old woman is not the same as a 17-year-old girl. They look similar, but they’re not the same. Here’s what it’s like: I had this dog once that I got from the pound. [laughter] You know how you get a dog… “Are you comparing women to dogs?” No! [laughter] You’ll see. [laughter] The dog, she was a sweetheart of a dog, but she had been the pound too long, she was real sketchy. And I would bring her around other dogs, and, like, when a dog has been in the pound, like, every other dog they think is going to take their food or take their bed. So I take it to the dog park, and she’d see dogs and go, “Fuck off! Fuck off!” And every dog would be like, “Whoa, Jesus.” [laughter] That’s how she acted with every single dog till one day, one day I brought her to the dog park and somebody brought a wolf. Some fucking hippie asshole with wooden beads on, wearing sandals, this motherfucker brought a thing that eats dogs into a cage filled with dogs! [laughter] My dog looked at that wolf and looked at me and went, “That’s not a fucking dog! Aah!” [laughter] She knew. I don’t know how she knew. She didn’t grow up in Alaska. She wasn’t a Montana dog. How the fuck did she know? But she knew. Somehow. Somehow. That had to be what it was like when that 17-year-old boy was around that 25-year-old woman. Like, “Um, where’d you go to school? Unh? Hmm?” [laughter] She’s like touching him. [groaning] ‘Cause 17-year-old girls don’t sound anything like 25-year-old women. You ever talk to a 17-year-old kid? They don’t know what the fuck they’re saying. They’re basically just practicing talking. [laughter] They’ve only been talking for, like, a few years. [laughter] They don’t know how to make shit sound good. They’re like, “Have you heard the new Drake song? It’s so fire!” You’re like… [groaning] Argh! What the fuck did you do to my ears? Meanwhile the 25-year-old cop’s like, “Let’s go back to my house, smoke some pot, and snuggle.” That kid’s like… “You have a house? [laughter] How the fuck did you get a house?” [laughter] Your dumb friends are like, “She saves, bro. [laughter] My cousin did it, my cousin bought a house.” Kids are always lying. 17-year-old kids. “Yeah, my cousin bought three houses by the time he was four.” What? Four? [laughter] Seventeen. “You should know better.” You know how crazy that is to say? That is a short amount of time on this planet, seventeen years old. And it’s a confusing time. Maybe one of the most confusing times ever for a boy, because your life is a certain way for 13 years, and then you start getting uncontrollable boners right around 13 years in. For 13 years you think you got life mapped out. “I get life, you do what you want, you kind of have a good time. You ride your bike and you play your games, hang out with your buddies.” And then suddenly two years later you’re waking up going, [screaming] “What do you want from me?” [laughter] And your dick’s like… [groaning] Every day. Every day. Confusion. “Do I love you?” [laughter] “What are you gonna do for a living, bro?” Another thing you get when you’re 17. “What are you gonna do? You’re almost a man. Be a loser?” “I don’t know.” And then you see, you see around you all these people that are chasing bullshit. Material possessions and nonsense lives, doing things they hate and getting stuck in a rut. You don’t want it to be you and you don’t know how to get out of that. And everybody’s confused and everybody’s like, “Bro, what are you gonna do for a living?” I don’t know! I don’t know. Just get together with your friends and try to figure life out. Unwind, hang out, smoke a little joint. Like, ‘Dude… [snorts] I think my girlfriend’s a cop.” [laughter] [cheers and applause] I’m like, “Dude, you’re paranoid. Trust me, it’s the weed. There’s no way.” Meanwhile, he was right. Poor little fuck. Nobody cares. ‘Cause nobody cares about boys. Why? Listen, don’t “aw.” It’s okay. We’re running shit. [laughter] It’s the balance of power. Look, it’s… it’s all for good. So much tension. ‘Cause, like, this is a new time for jokes too, because everything I say on this Netflix special is going to get me in trouble, but I… I knew coming in. But I want to explain to people if they’re mad\\xa0at me. Talk to me offstage, I’m super reasonable. But I say shit I don’t mean ’cause it’s funny. Like, people should get that but they don’t get that, not in 2018. Everybody wants to write it down and make it literal. “This is exactly what he said, here’s a quote.” “Oh, hate! Let’s end the hate! Enh!” [applause] And people are way more sensitive now. Because of the Internet, everybody has an opinion and they can all express it, when that’s not really necessary for some folk. Some folks, their opinion’s not that good. They should… keep it to themselves. But today, anybody can express opinions. I’ve gotten death threats for shit I don’t even remember saying. Like, I did a podcast with Tony Hinchcliffe, and apparently I said I thought pro wrestling was gay. [laughter] I don’t even remember saying it. [laughter] But I got off the podcast and I checked my Twitter, and the fucking hurricane of misspelled hate messages that came my way. I was like, “Aah!” What have I done? [laughter] I didn’t even mean what I said. It was just a funny thing to say in that moment ’cause he’s so into it. I’m like, “It’s gay.” It’s funny to say! [laughter] “No, it’s not ever funny to say.” Well, you don’t hang out with my friends. So I don’t know what the fuck to tell you. “Well, you’re a homophobic piece of shit! I wouldn’t hang out with your friends!” That’s not true. Here’s where you’re wrong. I… ‘Cause people tell you that you shouldn’t say something’s gay. But I love gay people. I’ve no problem with gay people. I’m happy they’re a real thing. I really am. I like it, mix it up. Who gives a shit? [laughter] So if you don’t like me calling things gay, then what word would you like me to use to describe gay shit? [laughter and applause] What are we doing here, man? There’s certain noises we can’t make with our face anymore? You know, I think the same fucking thing, right? [laughter] Gay’s not negative. It’s just gay. Okay? There’s certain things… [chuckles] There’s certain things that are gay that have nothing to do with men having sex with each other. Like musicals. [laughter] Right? No one knows why. They’re just gay. Men wearing pearls, gay as fuck. [laughter] It’s not a negative. And I don’t really hate pro wrestling. I was just talking shit. Like, when I was a kid, I loved Jimmy “The Superfly” Snuka, and Bob Backlun',\n",
       "  'd, and Hulk Hogan, and I love The Rock. I go to his Twitter page every day for inspiration. And who’s not a fan of Ric Flair? [audience] Woo! We didn’t rehearse that! [laughter] You knew what to do! That man has an exuberant noise attached to his name. That’s one of the most American things of all time. Right? I was just talking shit. That’s all it was. So Tony goes, “Listen, if you just watch pro wrestling with me, you’ll love it, and you’ll become a fan.” I’m like, “All right, dude. Turn it on.” He turns it on! I see a guy with shaved legs, wearing Speedos, with knee-high leather boots on, and he’s holding another guy down. But not really. [laughter] The guy’s like, “I can’t even get up.” And the guy he’s holding down is wearing a leather mask! I’m like, “What the fuck, Tony! [laughter] Have you watched this with a critical eye?” [uncontrollable laughter] I’m not saying it’s gay. But let’s just be honest. Everywhere else on the planet, other than that ring… [laughter] Everywhere else on Earth, when a dude shows up shirtless, wearing a leather mask and Speedos… he’s there to suck dicks. Okay? Period. [cheers and applause] I don’t care what you tell the cops. That guy knew what the fuck he was doing. So there’s going to be people mad at me for that, but I just want you to know, for a bunch of things. Here’s what’s really important. And I can’t believe you’ve to do this, but in 2018 you’ve to do this. You’ve to say a joke and then you go, “Hey, that’s not…” This is what I really feel. This… this is what I really feel. There’s nothing wrong… I don’t want anybody thinking I’m a bigot. There’s nothing wrong with being gay, nothing, and there’s nothing wrong with being a fan of pro wrestling. [laughter] But it’s the same thing. [laughter and applause] To me. I respect both of them. I think both of them are amazing. I’m super happy. I’ve had some other death threats this year. I, uh… [chuckles] …put a poster up, put a picture up on Instagram of some deer meat, and I wrote, “This is some meat from a deer that liked to kick babies and was about to join ISIS.” [laughter] I was feeling real good about that post. Then I got cocky and I wrote\\xa0hashtag #vegan and that’s where I fucked up. [laughter] Ooh! That wasn’t worth it. That didn’t feel good. Oh! The hate, the anger! Never in my life have I encountered such a ruthless, vicious group of kind, compassionate people… [laughter] as I have in that fucking hashtag #vegan group. [faint laughter] These vegans that are vegans for good reasons, folks, but the problem with vegans is the problem with every single group of human beings. If you get a group of 100 people, just pick a random 100 people, what are the odds that one of them is a fucking idiot? It’s 100%. We nerf all the sharp edges in this world and we let dummies survive. There’s no wolves running through our streets. It’s 100% that one out of 100 is a fucking idiot. Some of those are vegans, and this is how it works: if you got a group and you don’t have to take a test to get in there, some of them are in there for the right reasons. Most vegans are vegans ’cause they’re kind people. They don’t want anything to die so they can live. And those people are heroes, ’cause they’re always tired, they’re cranky, their health’s all fucked up. They’re doing it for all the right reasons. But then there’s vegans who are really only vegans ’cause Scientology didn’t find them first. [laughter and applause] -Okay? You know. Everybody knows certain vegans that would have joined the Taliban if they took the wrong flight, all right? They’re fucking dipshits. Those guys always have “vegan” in their name. It’s always like “vegan warrior.” They just start eating plants and start talking shit. They joined a gang. It’s a plant-based gang. [hysterical laughter] I don’t argue with these people but I do when they say something totally crazy to me. I will check their profile, see what they’re interested in. And this one lady said something really fucked up. She wrote me, she goes, “I hope animals eat your children in front of you. I hope everyone you know gets cancer. I hope you die in your mother’s arms.” And I’m like, “Well. [laughter] What’s this healthy lady up to?” [laughter] [laughs] So I go… I go to her fucking page. She has a bunch of hashtags, right? Normal ones like hashtag #vegan, hashtag #crueltyfree, and then I seen one that I’ve never seen before. It says hashtag #vegancat. [faint laughter] [Joe sighs] I check my watch. It’s 1:00 in the morning, I’m like, “Fuck, do I click this?” [laughter] I’m like, “I should just go to bed, right? I should just go to sleep. I shouldn’t do this. I should have some herbal tea and read a book.” And there’s the other part of your brain like, “Shut up, pussy. Click it. Come on! Come on!” I always listen to that part. That’s the secret to my success, I always listen… [chuckles] “Come on, pussy! Come on!” I click it. I’m hoping… This is what I’m hoping. I’m hoping hashtag #vegancat… I’m hoping what that is is, like, a support group. [laughter] Right? Like, we all have friends that are vegans that also have cats. You go over to their house and you’re like, “So why are you vegan again?” “Well, I just don’t think it’s our right to decide that an animal should live or die.” And then they open up a fat can of murder and give it to that little fucking psychopath that they live with. And you’re like, “Hey. [chuckles] Hey, man. What’s in that fucking can? What are you doing?” “Well, he’s a carnivore but I’m an herbivore.” If you are a vegan with a pet cat, that’s like being a doctor with a pet vampire. [laughter] Pick a team, fuck face. What are you doing? You live with a murderer! Okay? If you love animals, just shoot that cat right in the fucking head. That thing eats 200 animals a year. [laughter] That is what I was hoping. That’s what I was hoping hashtag #vegancat meant. Oh! But no. No. #vegancat is a whole fucking community of people who think it’s a good idea to feed your cat salad. [laughter] Now, before I go any further, it’s very important that I be completely truthful to you, ’cause people call you out all the time. It’s always some guy. “Actually… Actually you can feed your cat a vegan diet.” They do that little cunt nod. You know that thing that people do? [laughter] They tell you something and then… Oh, is that the worst? Even if they’re right, you’re like, “Fuck you and your facts. This fucking face thing you’re doing.” But he’s right. You can… feed your cat a vegan diet if you don’t mind them going blind… and dying young. “Is he serious?” Yeah, I’m fucking serious. You will, after this show, go on your phone and check out hashtag #vegancat, and you will be treated to a collection of pets that look like they live in a house with a gas leak. [laughter and applause] Every fucking cat is like, “When is the real food coming? What the fuck is…” They’re all lying down! I’m not joking! Every fucking cat. You’re gonna go, “He’s right!” They’re all lying down! All of ’em! And they die young!\\xa0Really fucking young! They take pictures, these fucking psychos. “RIP Tabby! We had five amazing years together!” The cat’s eyes are milky, its legs are stiff. It’s like… “What is this lady feeding me? Where’s the real food, bitch?” It’s a cat! You got to feed it cat food! “Hashtag #crueltyfree.” Tell that to your blind, dead cat, you fucking crazy asshole! -It’s a cat! Okay? [whistles and\\xa0cheers and applause] It doesn’t want to eat mashed potatoes! It makes us uncomfortable that something would want to kill something because what if someone wants to kill us? I don’t want that. That’s what it is. It’s just weird panic that we have about our own mortality. But it’s a real simple system. If this comes up in an argument, feel free to use this. This is how it works: Green shit grows out of the ground, dumb shit eats the green shit, mean shit kills the dumb shit. That’s your cat. That’s why you don’t have to hack your way through a river of bunny rabbits to get your fucking Prius every morning. Okay? You can’t feed that thing cranberries. [laughter] “We went to see Joe Rogan and he hates gays and cats. I am currently blogging about it.” [laughter] None of this is true. I love gay people and I have cats, and my cats are fluffy, which is gay. [laughter] I have gay things that I love. I listened to Miley Cyrus music right before I got onstage tonight. There’s plenty of gay things I love. I have those fluffy, those Monsanto, GMO cats. You ever see those cats? Like, how the fuck did that turn into that? You see a cat in a tundra and then you see my fucking thing. They’re called Ragdolls because, like… I don’t know you, ma’am, but if you came to my house, you could scoop that cat up, they wouldn’t get nervous. “Who’s this crazy lady?” They wouldn’t… Anybody could just pick one of those cats up and put it on their shoulder, and they’d just go limp. [purrs] ‘Cause I have a seven-year-old daughter. My daughter just scoops that cat up like a sandbag in a CrossFit class, and she’s barely got this fucking cat, and they just limp. [purrs] Purring away. So happy to be touched. They have almost no instincts. Almost. Almost! ‘Cause those little fuckers will sit in front of the window. And they see a squirrel across the street, their eyes lock on that squirrel, and they start making these involuntary mouth noises like… [Joe sputtering] [laughter] [repeats it] You ever see your cat do that? It’s so fucking creepy! They don’t even know you’re there. You can get right next to them, like, “What the fuck are you doing, man?” They don’t even look at you. [sputters] I’ve had that cat since it was a baby. It’s never been outside. Three-year-old cat, never been outside. And he sees those squirrels across the street and he’s like… “I remember. [laughter] [Joe imitates a soft growl] I remember the old way.” [growls] How the fuck does that DNA get into that cat? He’s not looking at that squirrel like, “That’s my little friend across the street. I’d like to meet him!” No, it’s like, “Ah! Your neck is right there.” [laughter and applause] That’s crazy. That’s some crazy, murderous DNA. That’s like if you had a science experiment where you had a man in captivity, and you never showed him a woman ever, until he was full grown, and then you show him a naked one through prison glass. And as soon as he sees her, he goes, “Time to fuck! Time',\n",
       "  '… time to fucking fuck!” [laughter and applause] Dudes come over with clipboards. “How do you know? How do you know what to do?” “I know what I know, bro! I know when it’s fuck time! It’s fuckety fuckin’!” That’s what it’s like for that cat. How the fuck does that cat know what to do? [uncontrollable laughter] Explain that to me, science. Cats kill everything they can. Dogs will keep it together. If you’ve a good dog, a good dog will keep it together. Like, you could could have a pet dog and a pet hamster, and that pet hamster, if you got a good dog, that pet hamster could live a long life. [laughter] But you got a pet cat and a pet hamster, that hamster’s got an hour to live. [laughter] And that’s just ’cause your cat’s going to torture it for 59 minutes. That poor little fucker’s like, “I think he’s done! Finally it’s gonna let me get away and I’m just gonna be free!” And the cat’s like, “Not today, motherfucker. Not today. You just stick the fuck down.” It’s what they do. You can’t feed ’em apples. It’s what they do. Dogs care. You can put a hamster on the floor in a room with a good dog. A good dog will look at you, look at the hamster. Look at you, look at the hamster. He’d be like, “Um… -can I fuck him up?” [laughter] “No! That’s Mr. Fluffers! Mr. Fluffers is the newest member of our family!” The dog just starts calculating, like, “Okay, okay. [hysterical laughter] Okay, okay. I like free food. These people are nice to me. Okay. [sniffs] [laughter] That’s a fucking rat, dude. That’s a rat! Okay. Okay. Okay, family. Yeah. Family, family!” You can tell, though, when that dog’s not totally on board, they just get a little too close to that hamster like, “Ooh! I was gonna fuck you up.” [laughter] [a few claps] But a cat, you don’t have a chance. Cats, they will make Exorcist noises. You can try to hold your cat in a room with a hamster, your cat starts going… [Joe caterwauling] [laughter] He’s letting you know, “Bitch, I’m about to claw your fucking eyes out! You’ll never see your kids again!” They don’t care how long you been feeding them. They don’t care about your history of free massages. “There’s a rat on the floor! If you let me go, I can kill the rat!” [loud meow] [laughter] And people keep those things as pets. That’s what’s so fucked up. Imagine if your kid did that, a kid that you couldn’t have in a room with something smaller than him, he’s like, “Gotta kill, Mommy! Murder! Kill!” Like, “Junior, sit down!” “No! Fuck you! Death!” “Well, we just can’t have a pet cat, ’cause Junior breaks the cat’s neck. He’s crazy. I don’t know what to do.” We just accept the fact this fucking cat’s a murderer. Can’t feed that thing cranberries, you crazy bitch. Okay? You’re the monster. Dogs feel bad when they kill things too if you’re mad. Like if your dog kills a hamster and you’re like, “How could you!” [sobs] “How could I? Shit! Did I do that? [groans] Damn it!” “I’m so disappointed in you.” “I’m disappointed in myself! -[laughter] [Joe groans] I’m sorry!” [sobs] [laughter] They walk to you sideways. “I fucked up, dude. Fucking seriously.” But your cat, the cat doesn’t feel remotely bad. Your cat kills something, you’re like, “How could you?” He’s like, “Bitch, you know me.” [laughter] He’ll walk away slow with his tail in the air so you can see his asshole. [uproarious laughter, applause] They don’t care. You scream at him. “You’re a monster!” They pull their ears back. Like, “Why you so loud?” And just lie down right in front of you and lick their own dick. “How about you just shut the fuck up while I lick my dick?” [cheers and applause] [whistles blowing] They don’t care. They don’t care about you. Cats know when you’re high too. They seem to know, you’re vulnerable. Dogs don’t have a clue. You come home high, your dog’s like, “You’re extra friendly today!” [laughter] If I’m watching Black Mirror at 1:00 in the morning, my cat will, like, sit down next to me and be like… “You know you’re going to die, right?” [laughter] [hysterical laughter, cheers and applause] Creepy little fuckers. Something… something spooky about predators, living with a little predator. You know? I think it’s good for us. I think it’s good for us to be nervous. I really do. I think we all need Jesus. [laughter] I grew up… I was raised Catholic for a little while, and then I wised up when I was about seven. And, um… [laughter] Since then, I was like, that discipline is probably pretty good for people. One of the things that gets me about, um, people that are really into Jesus is that you’re supposed to think that Jesus is going to return. But if he did, you’d never believe it. [faint chuckles] Right? Like, nobody believes new miracles. If someone came up to you and go, “Yo, dude. You gotta meet my cousin. He was dead for three days and he came back to life and he hangs out with hookers, but he don’t fuck ’em, he only gives ’em advice. [laughter] Want me to give him your number?” You’d be like, “Yeah, sounds like a good idea. I want to talk to him forever. He sounds totally legit.” [faint laughter] No, we only like old miracles. But I think there’s a new miracle that we might have missed, and I’m going to tell you this story. There was a woman who was born in Africa, she had a birth defect. She was born without a vagina. Grew to be a full grown woman, she had no other problems. Grew to be a full grown woman, gave a guy a blowjob, and then got into a knife fight. The knife went through her stomach, the sperm hitched the ride on the blade, and landed on her eggs. She got pregnant. Nine months later, by cesarean section, they open her up like a sleeping bag and pull out a normal kid. That’s a real fucking story. You’re like, “The Fear Factor guy just makes shit up to make his stupid fucking jokes work. That’s why they took our phones away, so we can’t call him out on his bullshit.” [laughter] No, I’m telling you a true story. Y’all don’t yell. It’s true. A woman without a vagina gave birth to a kid. Now… here’s my question. Isn’t that a miracle? That seems like a miracle. Like, if you… People that believe in Jesus, you’re supposed to believe he’s going to come back. But if he’s going to come back, do you think he’d come back looking like Jesus? Wouldn’t that be super obvious? We’d see him coming. We’d see the robe and the beard, like, “Dude, that’s Jesus. Hold my hand.” ♪ Kumbaya my Lord\\xa0♪ ♪ Kumbaya ♪ “Oh! Hi, Jesus. We didn’t even know you were coming. This is what we do.” [laughter] Jesus’d be like, “Hmm, I don’t know.” I think if is Jesus is going to return and find out what we’ve really been up to, he’s going to return as the miracle-blowjob knife-fight baby. [laughter] And we’d never even see it coming, ’cause we’re not looking for it. That kid’s got to go to school. Other kids are going to ask questions… right? You remember what childhood was like. Kids are fucking brutal. Everybody’s insecure, so they try to find someone more insecure than them and fuck with ’em. I had a good childhood, but it was weird. And it was weird because my parents split up when I was young, and then my mom lived with my stepdad for a few years before they got married, and we moved a lot. It wasn’t bad, but it was… Kids would ask questions like, “Hey, man, is that your dad?” “No, it’s my mom’s… boyfriend.” “Oh, so it’s a dude who fucks your mom?” [laughter] “Hey, man, I’m eight. [laughter] What about your parents?” “Dude, Dude! My parents have been married since high school. The first time my mom and dad ever had sex, my mom got pregnant with me. Bro… my dad cries a lot. He just cries! He’ll just fall down and start crying. We ignore him now. [laughter] No one cares. Step over him, pass the peas. We don’t give a shit. This poor fucker’s just weeping on the ground. Life isn’t a movie, man. I never saw that in a movie. Life’s not a fucking movie, dude. Life is hard.” “Yeah, man. Yeah, dude, life is hard, dude. It really is. It’s fucking hard. What’s your story, Mutombo?” “Oh, you know! Same old story. Mom ain’t got no vagina. [laughter] Suck a dick, get stabbed. Here I am. [faint laughter] You know, could be worse. Hashtag #blessed.” [laughter] [a few claps] From the humblest of beginnings, he’d be around us as we judged him. Change our ways. We should change our ways. The first thing we gotta do is stop doing this. You know what that is? That’s the symbol of the cross where Jesus was murdered. We got to stop doing this. Start doing this. [laughter] Love… and life. Love and life, brothers and sisters. Don’t get mad at me! You knew why you came here! You get mad. We’re a fucking hour in. If you’re mad now… Jesus Christ! [audience member] Woo! “Your point of view is terrible.” Yeah, it’s how I make a living. [laughter] I say fucked-up shit. You don’t have the time to think up. That’s all it is. Listen. Violence against women isn’t funny. I don’t know why you’re laughing. You guys are assholes. Ass-holes! “Especially in this day and age. -Ooh! [laughter] Oh! Dangerous time. Oh!” My own mom said this to me. She goes… “I just wish that Hillary Clinton was president, because I think it’s about time a woman does the most important job in the world.” Okay. I’m like, “Yeah, but you already make all the people.” [laughter] Like… [cheers and applause] I’m not saying, ladies, that that’s the only thing you can do. You make all the humans. That’s a big fucking deal. There’s seven billion people on the planet. All of them came out of a woman’s body. If babies came out of dude’s dicks, there’d be six of us. [laughter] An abortion would be an app on your phone. All right? It’d be snowing out, you’d pull your phone out, “Fuck this kid. I’m not shoveling snow and breastfeeding.” How about that, ladies? You make food with your tits! You know how goddamn crazy that is? You make the most nutritious baby food known to man, with your tits, while you’re doing other shit. [laughter] ‘Cause no one’s giving you enough credit for it, because so many of you can do it. That’s the problem. Almost every woman can make people. That’s the problem. If only one lady did it, one giant bitch that lived in the middle of the city… [hysterical laughter] She had a huge, clear abdomen with all our children floating around inside of it. We’d bring her food and blessings. That’s just as weird as a baby coming out of a person. We’re just used to our weird. But if that was the way you did i',\n",
       "  't and someone just said, “I’m making my own people. Look.” You’d be like, “Aah!” [laughter] If people didn’t come out of people and then they started, we would freak the fuck out. We’d be like, “What’s next?” No, the problem with the thing is, when you… childbirth, you have to be in the room to really understand it. It’s not like a thing you watch in a video and go, “Oh, I get it.” You think you get it, but you never get to see the kid unless it’s yours. No one lets you watch. Your friends never let you watch. Even my sister wouldn’t let me watch. I go, “What do you think? I’m gonna get horny and fuck you? Come on! Let me see the kid! I want to see my nephew.” Nobody lets you in. Nobody. It’s got to be your kid. By then it’s too late. ‘Cause you see the kid come out, you’re like, “Oh! Oh, okay.” And then you start thinking, “How often is this happening? This is happening right now all over the world!” But you don’t get to see it. There’s a website you can go to where you can see the actual numbers. You can see every time a baby is registered as being born. There’s like a world population number and that number is like this…. [mock buzzing] It’s just fucking spinning. It’s not sustainable. It’s not like, “Well, we gained a few people, we lost a few people. Keeping a healthy balance here on Earth.” No, it’s just people shooting loads into each other, just fucking… [mock buzzing] Eating food and coming in each other. [groans] You just don’t see it. But if there was a place you could see it, like if there was a giant drive-thru movie screen, and it was every baby coming out of every vagina in real-time all over the world, you’d be like, “It’s a fucking invasion!” You’d be like, “Oh my God, now I get it! The vagina is a portal to another dimension. It’s like a well of souls and they’re coming through with pleasure and love and confusing us! And then they grow up and they do whatever the fuck they want! This is how culture gets shaped! From aliens from another dimension!” Ladies… you do that. [faint laughter] You make people. You make all the people. And you want to be president too? You fucking greedy bitches. Jesus Christ! What else do you want? You want bigger dicks than us? You want all the money? [laughter] If I was a woman, I’d definitely be a feminist. 100%. Men are bigger, they make more money, they always try to fuck you, they lie to you. That’s too many things. [laughter] It’s too many. It’s not balanced. I get it, ladies. You know what I don’t get? Men’s rights activists. Every one I’ve ever met, I want to go, “Dude, we got all the rights. [laughter] We got ’em all.” Fucking relax! The problem is, guys that are clamoring for, “What about men’s rights?” They’re going to pay attention to what we do. This is the thing. If girls start doing an audit of what men do versus what women do, it’s a big fucking difference. Men cause all war. That is somehow or another some weird fact that slipped us by. Can you imagine if women caused all the war? How long would it take before we were like, “Yo, we got to kill these fucking crazy bitches. Dude, I came home, the girls are in the backyard making a plane to fly over the ocean and fuck people up they never met. These bitches are bloodthirsty. They never want to stay put, constantly conquering new ground, stealing people’s oil.” Can you imagine? “What about men’s rights?” Shut the fuck up. Stop. Men cause most of the murder. Men cause most of the rape. A guy stops me. “Actually, here’s a statistic you’re probably not aware of. But men actually get raped more than women.” Yeah, by other men, you fucking dipshit! Jesus Christ! [laughter and applause] You’re making my point for me, you stupid fuck. What did you think was happening? When you heard that number you’re like, “No more investigations needed. Clearly there’s packs of cheerleaders out there raping soldiers. We got to put a stop to it.” [cheers and laughter] No, men are so gross, we fuck each other. [laughter] See, I say that and no one gets mad. No men are like, “Bro, you’re fucking generalizing massively. [laughter] It’s such a douchebag move to just criticize an entire gender.” Men don’t care, ’cause I’m one of you, and you know. Like if I say guys jerk off to basketball games, you’re like, “Some of us. [laughter] For sure.” Right? But if I say anything even remotely critical about women, people will get really mad. Watch. [laughter] Ladies, I love you. You’re some of my favorite people. But let’s be honest, you don’t invent a lot of shit. [laughter] Ooh! Feel that? Yeah! That’s some ride-home arguments in the air. Right? You can feel the tension. “No, you were laughing. It’s not funny. You were fucking laughing! It’s sexist! No, he makes fun of men first so he can make fun of women later, you fucking moron. Oh my God, you don’t even know comedy. You don’t even know what you like. Drop me off. Just fucking drop me off. Just… drop me off.” But you know I’m right. Here’s what’s important about this. When it comes to inventions, we’re talking about inventions. Let’s be really clear. I am a fucking moron. Okay? I’ve never invented shit. And I’m guessing you’re probably pretty dumb too, which is why you’re here listening to me talk. Okay, let’s just be honest. [cheers and applause and whistles] We’re not talking about us. We’re talking about inventors. Okay, it’s not us. Why do we have to be on Team Penis versus Team Vagina on this one? It’s crazy. The men and the women in this room, we have more in common with each other than we do with those fucking freaks out there inventing all the shit we need to make our life awesome. Okay? But those freaks out there inventing shit are almost all dudes. And I don’t know why. But that makes me feel like a winner. [laughter] I feel like I won. I really do. I feel pretty good. And I’m looking around at some of you ladies and you look like losers. You look like you lost. You’re not even in the contest. You’re like, “Hey! [grunts] I don’t like this part.” [grunts again] If you’d your phone you’d be like, “Surely women have invented a bunch of things.” No, they haven’t. I wish they had. Women invented, like, 40 things ever. And it was all shit they needed. [laughter] A woman invented the dishwashing machine. [cheers and applause and laughter] I didn’t even write a joke for that. I’ll let you figure out why you’re laughing. Can’t call me out on a non-existent sexist joke. It’s just a fact. Women invented some very important things, actually. Like, no bullshit, all jokes aside, a woman invented Kevlar, which is the bulletproof material they use for first responder vests. Who knows how many lives were saved because of one woman’s invention? [cheers and applause] But! I bet it was probably a chick who wanted to shoot her husband… [laughter] but she didn’t want him to die, ’cause then she’d have to get a job. She’s like, “Hmm. [cheers and applause] There’s got to be a way to shoot this motherfucker and still sleep in.” Again, I’m a fucking moron! Don’t get mad at me! We’re just talking about inventors. I don’t want to leave any really important women inventors on the list who are all way smarter than me, but, like, one of them was Hedy Lamarr, a gorgeous actress from the 1940s. She invented spread spectrum technology, which is how we use GPS and Wi-Fi today. This one woman did that. But she was hot, no one cared. They were just trying to fuck her. Nobody paid attention to anything smart she said. They had to wait until she died. They’re going through her notes, like, “Fucking Wi-Fi. Hmm.” [laughter] Yeah. ‘Cause we’re gross! I already told you we’re gross. A woman invented the first hypodermic needle. It was one woman’s idea of how to effectively get medication into people. Who knows how many lives she saved? One woman’s idea was computer coding. One woman. She invented the computer code. Without her contribution, who knows? One person. Without this one woman’s contribution, who knows where technology would be today? After that… big drop off. I mean, fucking, like a cliff. The number 11 most impressive invention by a woman is the chocolate chip cookie. Again, I’m a fucking idiot. Way better than anything I’ll invent. But a dude invented the chocolate chip and a dude invented the cookie, and he probably just wanted to go to bed. He was probably like, “You nailed it. You’re an inventor. Goodnight.” She’s got her chef’s hat on. “Write it down. Write it down.” [laughter] I’ll leave you with this ’cause it’s uncomfortable but also true. A man invented the tampon. Let that soak in. Oh! Oh! How’d I do that to you? [laughter and applause] I had to. That’s what you have to say right there. I know. But for real, a tampon is not a good invention. It’s just one of those things that’s been around for a long time, but it’s like a legacy invention. It seems like a male solution to a body part he doesn’t have and a problem he doesn’t understand. Like, “What? What’s going on? Huh? Aah! Just stuff something up there!” [laughter and applause] No woman is ever going to invent a tampon! A woman would have invent a maxi pad. Like, “Hey, hey, stupid. We’re not stuffing anything. We’re just going to take this, put it there, leave it alone. It will be fine.” “Fuck that! We’re gonna make a cotton dick and just stuff it up there. Get in there.” [laughter] “What if it gets stuck?” “I’m going to put a rope on the end of it and yank it out like a fish.” Thank you, Boston! [cheers and applause] I had a great fucking time! I love you, people! [cheering and applause continue] For real, it makes me incredibly happy to be able to do this here. This is where I started. You people are the shit and I love you. Thank you.

All right. Thanks. [laughing] Oh! Story time. Nice. Well, I’ll settle in. Okay. Um… [sighs] Mae, I just got mine replaced. [kisses] [kisses] Hope you backed up the pictures from your wedding. [sighs] Um, can you introduce me? Okay. [clears throat] Can you do the “And now” one? The “And now”? Okay, got it. Thank you. And now, please put your hands together, and welcome to the stage, the one, the only, Mae Martin! [crowd cheering] Hi! [crowd continues cheering] How we doing? [chuckling] Hey. Hi. Nice to see you. Oh my God. This is the best. Thank you so much for being here. What’s… Uh… Okay. [laughs] I have so much to tell you, genuinely. Um… What is everybody’s name? Should we just start… On the count of three, everybody say your name. Ready? One, two, three. [crowd yelling names indistinctly] Hello, uh, I’m Mae. I’m so pumped to be in Canada right now. Just, I really… [crowd cheering] Um, I… I am Canadian. I’m very Canadian. [scattered whoops] But, please, I’ve been living in England for the past 12 years. I’ve been living in London. So I do sound a bit like an asshole. I do have a slight, like, Madonna lilt. And I’m trying so hard to fight it. I’m really sorry. But it’s… My dad’s British. Like very… He’s very, very British. He’s like… My dad’s like a mystical British gentleman. He’s very… He’s a magical man. He’s very into, like, the phases of the moon. He’s… He’s a moon man. He’s into, like, um… He knows all the birds that ever visit his garden and he has a specific relationship with each bird. And my childhood, like my whole childhood, was pretty mystical. Like, the best example I can think of… Okay, when I was about eight years old, my dad was driving my brother and I to karate class. And it was a very Canadian scene. It’s like 5:00 p.m., the sun’s already going down. It’s snowing, we’re on the highway. We’re going to the karate dojo. Me and my brother in the backseat. I’m eight, my brother’s 12. I was a green belt in karate, my brother was a yellow belt. So he was four years older, two belts lower. Um… Which is not important, but I thought I would flag it. And, uh, we’re driving along the highway and suddenly my dad, like, swerves to the side of the highway in, like, a panicked move. And tires are screeching, people are honking. Really dangerous. He pulls over, and he’s really shaken up, and he goes, [British accent] “I’m so sorry, children, but we have to get out of the car.” [regular accent] We’re like, “What?” And so we get out of the car. We’re standing by the side of the highway, in the snow. My brother, 12 years old, so embarrassed, he’s like, in his karate uniform. And people are driving by, they’re like, “Is he a yellow belt? ‘Cause…” “Hang on a second. He looks older…” “We’re gonna turn the car around. Check this out.” And so we’re like, “What is going on?” And my dad goes, “I’ve just seen the new moon through glass.” So, he had seen the sliver of the new moon through the windshield and we had to pull over, get out of the car, and he made us bow to the moon three times. We had to do this whole ritual. We had to say, “Good evening, Lady Moon.” It was… It was mystical. He’s a moon man. He’s deep into the moon. And, um, I was just visiting recently, uh, visiting home. This is my childhood home that I grew up in, and they’ve had it since long before I was born. And I’m in the kitchen with my mom and dad, and my dad comes up to me and goes, “Meet me in the study at dusk.” I’m like, “But I…” I go to my mom, I’m like, “What time is dusk?” She’s like, “I don’t know.” [laughs] And I go up to the study, which is like… It’s been many things over the years, it’s been like a spare room or whatever. My dad’s there with a glass of wine, looking out the window. He wanted to show me there’s a family of raccoons that lives in a tree in the neighbor’s yard. And, like, every night at dusk, they emerge, and he’s got, yeah, a relationship with them all. Um… So, we’re standing, waiting for the raccoons, and he just really dreamily goes, um… “Do you know you were conceived in this room?” Which… So I was like, “Oh…” And I don’t like to shut him down when he’s being vulnerable, so… I was like, “Wait. You remember the specific night that I was conceived?” And he said this phrase, which truly has haunted me ever since. He said, he goes, “Yes, of course I remember it.” “I remember it well.” This is what he said. “The moonlight shone in over your mother’s bottom.” [crowd gasps, laughs] Over your… I feel like you’re not fully getting, like… I now know the position I was conceived in. I’m horrified. Nobody wants to be conceived doggy style. It’s so bleak. You don’t want… You want to be conceived face to face. Eye contact. At the moment of ejaculation, just like we… “We’re making a choice to make a life.” Not like, “Ah! Bite the pillow!” It’s horrible. It’s… It’s bleak. It’s like… It’s changed how I see myself. Like, how I… I’m like, “I’m a doggy-style baby.” [crowd laughing] Makes a lot of sense, actually. Explains a lot. It’s, like, affected my posture. I’m just a little more… I’m like… Just a little hunched. [laughs] I feel like I can spot other doggy-style babies when I’m out in the world, 100%, there’s… I’ll be getting on the subway, and there’s someone… [grunting] Smoking on the subway. I’m like, “Oh, yeah.” Or I’ll be in a bar, and the bartender’s like, “Sorry, someone’s just sent you a drink.” I look down the bar, and… [grunting] Another doggy-style baby. There’s some in here tonight. I can see us. Several. [Mae laughs] They… Every time I go home to visit, something like this happens. Something that derails my… my grasp on reality. Like, um, okay, my parents have this anecdote, and it’s a story they’ve been telling my whole life. Like, once a year, they’ll have a few drinks and tell this story at a dinner party or whatever. Um… And it makes me feel crazy, because I’m like, “It cannot be true.” So, why are you doing this to me? What is this? Um, and my brother and I get really upset. I’ll tell you the story and then you can be the judge, if you think it’s true or not. Okay? [audience whoops] Okay. So, my parents swear that when they were in their late twenties, they were driving through Northern Ontario, down a winding road through a forest, and they drove under a moose. [crowd laughing] [scoffs] They swear. They swear. My mom says they were driving down this winding road, the moose was horizontal on the road, and they drove under its belly. It makes me feel insane. I’m like, “What are you talking about?” It’s… And so it’s… [laughs] She does a sound effect of the sound of the belly fur of the moose gently grazing the roof of the car. Just like… [whooshes softly] Can you imagine? It makes me feel insane. It makes me feel crazy. And, uh, it makes my brother irate, as well. Because… So, the last time I was visiting, me and my brother were like, “We need to get to the bottom of this.” We need to find out if this is even possible. So we did research and we found out the height of a Toyota Tercel. That’s the car they were driving. So, the height of the roof of the car. We Googled the largest ever recorded moose. And the infuriating thing is it could just have happened. It could just have happened. If they happened to stumble upon the biggest-ever recorded moose, I guess it’s possible. It makes me feel insane. [sighs] You think it’s true? Give a cheer if you think it’s true. [crowd cheering] Really? Give a cheer if you think it’s bullshit. [loud cheering] See? I don’t know. I think it says a lot about your worldview. Like, if you believe in the moose, you’re young at heart. You… You’ve retained a sliver of, like, childlike enthusiasm about life. And if you don’t believe in the moose, you’re… Look, it’s been a tough couple years. It’s been tough, hasn’t it? Oh my God. It really has. We got to do whatever it takes to get by. You know? Whatever makes you feel good. Like… So my father sent me a news article recently. Uh, he sent me this news article, and was like, “I thought you’d like this.” “I thought you’d relate to it.” Those are the words he used. “I thought you’d really relate to this.” This was the story, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it. I’m going to tell it to you. So this, it happened in the Netherlands, in a small town in the Netherlands, where basically this family noticed that they weren’t getting any mail. They were like, “We haven’t received any mail in a long time.” Weeks start going by. They’re like, “Wait. We’re not even getting our bills or pamphlets in the mail. This is really weird.” So they go to their neighbors. “Are you guys getting your mail?” They’re like, “No. This is so weird. Not for so long.” So they go to the post office and speak to, like, the boss. The mail boss, you know. [chuckling] You know, the mail boss… that you have to defeat to pass Level 10. [laughs] He’s like… [growls] And, um… They’re like, “We’re not getting any of our mail.” He’s like, “I’ll look into it.” He goes to speak to the mailman who’s responsible for that block. And I can’t remember the mailman’s name, so we’ll call him like… Gary. We’ll call him Gary. He’s like, “Gary, these people are saying that they’re not getting their mail.” “What’s going on?” And Gary’s like weirdly defensive right away. He’s like, “I don’t know what to tell you. I deliver the mail.” “If they’re not getting mail, it means no one’s writing to them.” They’re like, “Okay.” So the mail boss is like, “Okay, Gary.” But privately, to his coworkers, he’s like, “What’s up with Gary?” Gary is being really weird. So they decide they’re going to keep an eye on Gary and investigate the sitch. And so, the next day, Gary comes to work and first red flag, he picks up the mail and gets in his personal vehicle. Not the mail truck or whatever. Gets in his… And he drives out of town. So they’re like, “Fuck.” And they followed him. They follow him, and he drives into the forest in the Netherlands. And they follow him at a distance. They watch him park. They park. They’re keeping an eye on him. They see him get out of the car. He takes the bag of mail, he goes into the woods, he’s gone 45 minutes. He comes back out with no bag. Gets in his car, drives away. So they go in after him. Into the forest. And… Imagine this. This is the sight they’re confronted with, okay? Beautiful, dappled sunlight, you know. Mist rising from the moss. There’s a lone moose. A huge moose in the background. Just towering over the trees, truly. Um… [laughs] And they see, as far as the eye can see, there are hundreds of piles of freshly turned earth. Little… In neat rows stretching through the forest. And they dust, they brush the dirt up. Gary’s been burying the mail. He’s been burying the mail for ages. This has obviously been going on a long time and it’s now amped up. They’re like, “Fuck.” And, uh… They approach him the next day at work. Gently. They approach him gently. They’re like, “Hey, Gar. Um…” [clicks tongue] “I…” “We noticed you’ve been burying the mail.” “And we were just wondering, why are you doing that?” And in the news article, this was the direct quote from the mailman, in answer to the question, “Why are you burying the mail?” This is what he said. He said, “I did it once, it felt good.” “And now it’s just kind of what I do.” I love him. He’s my hero, I… Guys, Gary went to jail. He went to jail for eight months. Yeah. You can’t fuck with the mail, that’s a federal offense. Um… He went to jail. And I wanted to write him fan mail in jail, but I don’t want to stress him out. ‘Cause he’d be like, “I want to bury it. Argh!” [laughs] But, no, I really was, like… I’ve never felt so seen by',\n",
       "  \" my father. Um… That’s… [chuckles] It has been tough. Like, I’m trying to get back into life and sort of feel that enthusiasm again of pre-pandemic life. Especially, I’m struggling to feel that enthusiasm in my romantic life. I don’t know if anyone is in the same boat. [scattered cheers] But post-pandemic dating, like, I’m… ‘Cause I’m 35, like… In my early 20s, so romantic. Obsessed with finding “the one.” My parents are very in love and that was my model. So I just… Somebody would be, “Do you have the time?” And I’d be, “I love you as well.” Is that… “And I…” “And I want to go with you.” [awkward laugh] “Where are we going?” Um, and now I’m just a bit like… I don’t know. Last summer, I dated someone. A man, actually, a lovely man, if you can believe. Not if you… Wait, not if you… Not “if you can believe that men can be lovely.” Of course they can. But if you can believe that I… Um… Yeah, so we dated for like six months, me and this guy and, uh… You know it was really nice, but I’m 35, he’s 36. Like, at this point, we both have big exes in our past. You know what I mean? We’re never going to be that big ex for each other. Like, we’re never gonna properly traumatize each other, so it’s kind of like… What’s the point? Um… [audience laughter] And… [laughs] So, we were in bed one night, and we were just chatting, we were having a nice light-hearted chat. He wasn’t trying to be heavy. He just goes, “If we had kids one day, what would we name our kids?” I was, like, “I don’t…” I was like, “I don’t know.” At this point, I’ve had that conversation with so many people. I was like… [sighs] “I don’t know.” “Let me just wade through this graveyard of dead hypothetical children to try to get to the new hypothetical kids.” I’m passing the ghosts of ’em. I’m like, “Oh, look!” “There’s Olive and Basil, the twins.” [laughs] They’re there. They’re like, “You forgot about us.” I’m like, “Oh, fuck off.” There’s little Clementine, I sent her to a private school. You know? She’s got a clarinet through her head. [in child’s voice] “Come and play with me.” [regular voice] I’m like, “No.” [chuckling] And I finally find the new hypothetical children, I’m like, “I have no creative energy left to name these children.” Like, “Can we just call them both Ian?” I don’t know. Did you guys know that…? This is true. In 2018, there were no new Ian’s born. There were no… It’s a true story. In 2018, not a single new Ian registered on this planet Earth. That is true. And if you’re watching this, and you hate the show, at least take that with you. You know? Wait, so do you guys know what I mean when I say big ex? Like, you have your exes. [scattered cheering] Okay. Really? You’re like, “Yes, we know.” Like you have your normal exes and then you have, like, your big exes. Where you reach a certain page in the novel of your life… No. Uh, I do feel you reach a certain age and you just have to accept that for the rest of your life there’s certain names, where every time you hear them, all of your organs are gonna dissolve. And just fall out of your vagina. Or your bum hole, if you don’t… And you have to carry around a plastic bag just in case you have to collect your… [laughs] It’s disgusting. Um… So, I have a couple of significant big exes, but I have this one who… I want to tell you this story. So basically, this ex, it was a really intense relationship, it was like four years. And it was a secret relationship because it was her first non-heterosexual relationship. She was like, “We can’t tell anyone.” And we lived together. It was so stressful. And she broke up with me, which is not allowed. Um… Which… I thought I had made that clear. [chuckles] Um… It was a long, drawn-out break-up. Anyway, so at the point where this story takes place, I hadn’t seen her in a year and a half or had any contact. I was in London and I was doing a show, and I was feeling good that night. You know what I mean? Like, I had a fresh haircut. I was freshly shorn. You know the feeling? I was wearing a crisp black T-shirt and… [laughs] Crisper than this. I’m sorry about this. This is… crumpled. Crumplestiltskin over here. [laughing] Do you remember Rumpelstiltskin? [crowd cheering] What happened to him? He used to be everywhere. We used to always talk about him. When you’re a kid, Rumpelstiltskin this, Rumpelstiltskin… Now you never hear about him. I get it. It’s hard to stay relevant. You know? He’s, like, faded into obscurity. Anyway, so I’m feeling good on this particular night, feeling crisp. Feeling shorn, and, uh… And also my best friend Joe was with me that night. He was in the audience of my show. I love having Joe in the audience, he’s a generous laugher. He’s a real angel, like, my best, best friend. And, um, I do the show, it goes well. And I go to the green room afterwards. Out the green room door to meet Joe. And I’m… It was a good show. I’m like, “Hey, man. Fun show.” But he’s like green. Just all the color has left his face, and he just goes, “She’s here.” And I’m like, “Fuck.” I know exactly who he means right away, so I’m like, “Okay.” And he goes, “Look, she’s upstairs.” “She doesn’t know you’re in the building. She came to the bar to have a drink with some of our mutual friends.” He goes, “Let’s just sneak out the back.” “Let’s have a fun night. We’ll go to a different bar.” And I thought about it. And then I thought, “No.” “I don’t want to have a fun night.” So, I’m like, “No, we’ll go upstairs.” We go up, I’m feeling confident. I see, there she is with our mutual friends and, um… You guys would have been very proud of me. I walk over very cool. [laughs] What does that mean? I walk over… Uh… Um… No, I walk over feeling confident. And… I’m also… I have the element of surprise. She doesn’t know I’m in the building. I think this is gonna work in my favor. So I walk over, go, “Hey.” Our mutual friends, they all know how bad the breakup was by this point, so they see me coming. I go, “Hey, how’s it going?” She’s like, “Oh my God, hi.” She stands up. We hug. It’s really nice. I go, “Great to see you.” “Hey, I heard you got that part, that’s so great.” She’s like, “Yeah. Congrats on stuff.” And I’m like, “Yeah, great.” It’s going well, and I suddenly think, “You know what, I need to be the one to end this interaction.” Right? I need to retain control of the situation. Like, I need to… We talked for a while, and I go, “Listen, so good to see you…” She goes, “You want to sit down?” I’m, “No, no, I’m gonna hang with my friends at the bar, but it’s really nice to see you.” We hug again, she sits down. I’m walking to the bar and she’s still kinda casting glances over her shoulder as I walk to the bar. And, as I’m walking to the bar, I suddenly realize, “What friends at the bar?” There are no friends at the bar. Joe has sat down at her table. He’s a snake. He’s dead to me. I’m panicking ’cause she’s still kinda looking. And I’m walking to the bar. Thank God, at the last second, I see three girls who were in my show. They were in the front row of my show. So I’m approaching the bar, thank God, one of them goes, “Hey, great show tonight.” So I think… I think probably what she wanted out of that interaction, like, what she expected from that interaction, was kind of like, “Hey. Great show tonight.” “Oh, cheers, thanks for coming.” What she got was so intense. I was like, “Hi, how are you? What are all of your names and jobs?” So tactile as well. Weirdly tactile. Like my arm around all their shoulders, like my head on their shoulder. I’m like… Mm! [laughs] They’re like, “Whoa, okay. Uh…” We’re chatting. Then, thank God, we start chatting, it’s going well, we’re getting along. So I’m like, “Crisis averted.” They’re like, “You want a drink?” I’m like, “Yeah.” We’re having a drink and I suddenly feel a tap on my shoulder, and I look around and it’s my big ex. This time she has the element of surprise, because I wasn’t expecting it. She goes, “Hey, sorry to interrupt, I want to say bye, I’m leaving now.” I’m like, “Yeah, yeah.” And we hug. And she said something awful, like… Like… “I’m sure our paths will cross one day.” You know what I mean? Something like that, where all my organs dissolve. Get the plastic bag out. Oh God. Um… [laughs] And so we hug, and she’s leaving, she turns. She’s still kind of saying goodbye to some people here, and I turn back to my “friends,” and suddenly, like, I guess I just got overwhelmed. And the floodgates just open and I just start sobbing. So… No, my face like crumbles, my shoulders… I’m literally just like… [sobs] They’re like, “Oh my God, are you okay?” And I just go, “Laugh, laugh!” [sobs] “Laugh!” It was psychotic behavior. I’m literally like, “Fucking laugh. Ah!” [sobs] And they’re all like… “Ha-ha-ha-ha.” [laughs] [sighs] There’s no real punchline to that story, it’s just… a vignette, if you will. To illustrate the level of emotion I’m operating on. I mean… I have a lot of feelings. Do you guys have a lot of feelings? [crowd whooping, clapping] It’s exhausting, you know. I’m full to the absolute brim with feelings. I always visualize, um… like Campbell’s tomato soup. That it’s… You know what I mean? Campbell’s cream of tomato soup. And then I’m full to brim. Right to the top of my skull, just trying to keep it contained. Just trying to keep it from sloshing out of my orifices as I make my way through life. That’s how I feel about my feelings. All it takes is one person goes, “How are you?” And it’s like… fling! Like, it shoots out my ear. They’re like, “Oh God.” I’m like, “I’m sorry.” [sobbing] [sadly] “That’s not about you.” [chuckles] No, I’m all right. I got a therapist recently. Yeah, yeah, yeah. [crowd cheering] Yeah, you have to, guys. You do. Like… Well, if you’re gonna complain as much as I complain, unfortunately, you do have to get one. Um… Yeah. I feel like my friends were starting to be like, “You should pay someone to do what you expect of us.” I was like, “Oh, okay.” I found this therapist and he’s really smart and we Zoom. And he said something interesting where he said, “Remember, you are not the feeling.” “Sure you feel consumed by the feeling, but you are not the feeling.” He said, “Within you, and within everyone, there’s a very still, neutral, eternal self.” “And you experience the feelings, but you’re not consumed by them.” He said, “Rather than identifying so much with the feeling, like, ‘I’m anxious, I’m this.'” He said, “Don’t be consumed by the feeling.” “Just observe the feelings as they come, with curiosity.” Have you heard that before? Apparently that’s the… So I think you’re just supposed to be like, “Huh.” “I’m experiencing rage.” “How curious.” “How curious.” [laughs] I had a really, um, weird thing where, during the pandemic… I spent the whole pandemic in London. I was just in my apartment, in the rain, in London for… years. [laughs] And, uh, I noticed an unexpected feeling bubbling up where I was, “Why do I feel embarrassed?” Like, I would wake up feeling embarrassed. And I was spending a lot of time, obviously, in my apartment. in my living room, and in my bedroom, specifically. And I was like, “Wait, okay, maybe it’s this.” Okay, stay with me. Don’t you think it’s kind of embarrassing that we’re adults and we still have rooms? Okay, stay, wait. That we’re like, “This is my room. Hm.” “This is my room.” “Don’t go in my room.” [laughs] It’s embarrassing. “I have to clean my room.” And, like, please. I, of course, accept and understand that we need rooms. You need four walls within which to lay your weary head each night. But I think what I find so embarrassing about it is, like, the way we decorate our rooms to reflect our individuality. And we’re like, “I’m me.” Right? “I’m myself in my room.” It’s so embarrassing. “I have one Himalayan salt lamp.” “Yes I do, and I’m me.” “I have my pi\",\n",
       "  'cture on the wall and I…” When you finish reading a book, you never get rid of it. You’re like, “I put it on the shelf in my…” “That is my personality on display for all to see.” [chuckles] “No one else is me.” And then I was thinking… Okay, this is a little abstract, but don’t you think, in a way, our brains and our minds are like our rooms, and we furnish our minds with experiences that we collect to then build what we think of as our identity and selves? And that’s all we’re doing. We’re little experience hunters, collecting these to put them on our brain shelves and be like, “I’m me.” And I always visualize every experience that we collect is like a little novelty snow globe. We’re just going around, being like, “One time I saw Antonio Banderas at the airport. Yes, I did.” “I’m myself. And no one else is me.” [laughs] And then all human interaction is, really… I really noticed this coming out of the pandemic. All interaction is just basically taking turns showing each other our snow globes. And being like, “I…” And just pathetically taking turns. And, like, someone will be showing you their snow globe, you know, and you’re trying to be a good listener. It’s a story about a party they went to five years ago. And you’re like, “Yes, and you are you as well.” Like, “Yes, exactly, yes.” “How wonderful to be yourself as well.” But the whole time, your eyes are darting to your own shelf. A hundred percent, the whole time… You’re like, “Mmm, yes. Well, no. Yes.” Waiting for your moment to be like, “And me as well. I have one…” [laughs] [crowd cheering] Thank you. This is so exciting. You know what? I was thinking… Well, I watch a lot of stand-up specials. Then my friend’s special came out recently, and they put out the trailer. I was like, “Fuck, it’s so dynamic.” Like, she’s so physical onstage and doing… I was like, “I don’t really move much.” Like I’m very… Then I was like, “What if?” ‘Cause I really want my trailer to be dynamic. So, I was like, “What if I just…” I know in my head the things I want to see in my trailer. I just haven’t written the jokes that go with the movements. So I was like, “Maybe I just do the movements.” And then I put it in the trailer and it’s just, like… Just like this. That’s in the trailer, how good would that be? You’d be like, “I gotta watch that.” [crowd cheering] I should just have, like, a hundred trained dogs. They all come out on the stage like this. And they’re all on their hind legs jumping and then we just have it in the trailer and never in the show. [laughs] Um… Yeah, feelings. I got a lot of feelings. So… rage, embarrassment. These are some of the feelings. Um… Another feeling that I… It’s very dominant in my life, and I think a lot of people relate to this, it’s, like, nostalgia. I’m very nostalgic. You know? And I know that’s kind of a useless emotion, like I’m… I’m nostalgic for pre-pandemic times and we didn’t know how good we had it. I’m very nostalgic, really, for pre-puberty, if I’m being honest. That’s where it all went wrong. Like… Yeah, and my friends are like, “Oh, yeah. You missed the ’90s.” That’s so original. “Do you miss how all of our parents used to have a lot of rubber bands?” Do you remember how everyone had rubber bands? You’d find them around drawer handles and shit. There’d be a whole ball of them. What were they for? I have no rubber bands now. “Do you miss how all parents had one big conch shell in the bathroom?” I’m like, “Yes. Yes, I do miss that.” Yeah. And I miss the easier access to abortion and less populism. Yeah. You know what I mean? Yeah. [crowd cheering] I do feel, I think I’m someone who I never really got over puberty. Well, for a couple of reasons. I think puberty hit me like a ton of bricks, really. First of all, I’m exactly the demographic where, um, for me, puberty coincided almost exactly with the arrival of the Internet and the popularization of the Internet. I’m so lucky. I had, like, one to 13, kind of… It wasn’t around. And I remember the one computer in our classroom got the Internet. And overnight, the world just exploded, everything changed, it was like… We all got our first e-mail addresses. Mine was hot-mae-el@hotmail.com. [audience laughter] Thank you. Those were the days you could get the good email addresses. But it was like overnight the world went from being very manageable… Everything I needed to know was in just in one set of Encyclopedia Britannica’s in my parents’ basement. It was so relaxing. It was like a finite amount of facts. That was it. The nice, thin paper. You know what I mean? It was manageable. It wasn’t… Also, it was like objective truth. Like, no one was putting out the devil’s advocate set of encyclopedias. You know what I mean? Like, “Well…” “Are you sure Lima is the capital of Peru?” Um… [chuckles] And then overnight it was like… I was obsessed with it. I remember my friends at lunch being like, “We’re gonna go out and play at recess. Wanna come?” I’d be like, “No, there’s so much work to be done on the Internet.” “There’s so much going on.” I was like, “I have to copy and paste images of Buffy the Vampire Slayer into a Word document.” I then have to print that Word document. The paper will be sodden with ink. Just heavy with ink. Like… I have to cut those pictures out, and it’s going to be like cutting wet toilet paper. I then have to stick those pictures onto my homework diary. Like, I’m busy. I… I truly feel like I’ve been busy ever since. I’m exhausted. And another reason that I think puberty really hit me was, like… Okay, so, yeah. Regular puberty stuff, then the Internet arrives and the stuff that brings with it. And then for me, also, puberty triggered kind of a wild gender dysphoria and a gender thing. You know what I mean? [crowd] Yeah! [laughs] Uh-huh? Dead silence. Um… No, but really, like, before puberty, I felt like I was this bounding, androgynous child, very confident, did a lot of Ace Ventura impersonations. And then suddenly puberty hit and my body’s changing, I felt very like… And this was the ’90s too. This was the era of girl bands and boy bands, right? This was the very pop-fueled binary. And I went to an all-girls school, which I just, like… The ubiquitous question, the question you needed to know an answer to at my school was which Spice Girl are you? And it was like, there’s only five possible answers. You needed to know. You’d be in the hall, and a group of girls would corner you, “Which one are you?” ‘Cause they’re organizing lip-syncs and stuff. They need to know, no judgment. They did need to know where you fit into the constellation. It was like, “Which one are you?” And I was like, “Justin Timberlake. I don’t know.” “Nick Carter?” Um… I think, regardless, if you experience gender stuff, puberty anyway is a fucking nightmare. Like, you feel like an alien, and everything that was cool about you just becomes worthless overnight. Like, okay, I had this trick. Okay, well, it’s a noise that I can make with my hand. And I swear, it was really popular. People loved when I did it, it killed at parties. I’m going to do it for you now. Uh… Okay, maybe some of you remember this. Um, okay, this is the noise. [high-pitched vibrating vocalizing of “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”] Do you remember that? Guys, I swear, it used to kill at parties. People would request it, they’d be like, “Do the noise.” I’d be like, “Okay.” I did it in a school assembly once. That was… That was too far, but, um… It was really cool, and then, all of a sudden puberty hit, suddenly I’m at a house party, I’m in a cupboard with a pimply 13-year-old boy who’s got a semi, and I’m like… [vocalizing “The Lion Sleeps Tonight”] And he’s like, “What the fuck?” He’s like, “I thought you were gonna give me a hand job.” I’m like, “No.” “I said… that I could do something cool with my hand.” [cheering] He leaves me alone in the cupboard. I’m there in the dark by myself, like… [vocalizing “Mad World”] Really mournful. [cheering] It’s hard to live at that age. It’s really… I mean… Don’t you think that the only way to flirt when you’re 13, the only acceptable way, is to go, “How big are your hands?” That’s… Don’t you think? Do you remember that? “How big are your hands?” I still kinda think that’s a great move to make physical contact with someone that you like. Except I was at my all-girls school, just sort of slightly getting it wrong. “Yeah, my hands are pretty massive.” “Yeah, yours are tiny, of course.” Going around the playground, being like, “Well, you know what they say.” “Big hands, massive labia.” [laughs] [exhales] But… So all that was going on, you know? And I think for everyone, at puberty, you do kind of… You develop critical thinking and suddenly, sort of, the hard facts of life are hitting you. I think if you’re, like, different in any way, like, if the dominant narrative that’s being told to you by everyone doesn’t match what you’re experiencing, know what I mean? Like, with gender, people being like, “There’s two. And you’re a woman and this is what it’s like.” And you’re like, “Okay.” But you’re experiencing something completely different. Then you kind of have two options. You can either question the validity of yourself and your experience or you can question the validity of everything else and the whole system. Once you start pulling that thread, you’re fucked. It’s like… Monogamy, you’re like… Can I bring two people to prom? Why not? I don’t get why not. And I really felt… And also, like… For me, I, um, I started doing comedy when I was 13 and I discovered… I got really into drugs, like psychedelic drugs. So that just exacerbated the general existential wave. Like I felt like I was peeling back the wallpaper on reality and I was seeing this very flimsy scaffolding holding everything up. I was just like, “What is going on?” You suddenly realize your parents are flawed, your teachers are, like, lonely or something. I remember being, “Mm, I think Ms. Buchanan’s lonely.” “I feel a huge amount of pressure to laugh at her jokes. And I don’t know.” Um… And yeah, I remember being really stressed by why don’t we, as a society, talk more about the fact that the movie Antz and the movie A Bug’s Life came out in the same year. Surely, powerful forces are at play here and we’re just not going to address it? Like what the… Um… Yeah. So, yeah, I was stressed and… And also, I think with drugs, it was a way to get out of my body. I was feeling very uncomfortable in my body and it was this trap door. And so I got heavily into drugs, and the bullet points are, I went from psychedelics into, like, the really bad ones. I got kicked out of my house. I dropped out of school. Fast-forward, I ended up in rehab. When I was 19, I went to a rehab day program for nine months. Uh… A rehab day program for teens, objectively, a bad idea. Well, in a way, right? Like, you get a group of teenagers together, all they have in common is they love doing drugs. Every day, at 3:00 p.m., the bell goes and they’re like, “Off you go with your new friends.” “Run along. Bond in the alleyways.” “The only way you know how.” [laughs] Um, but it was very eye-opening for me. It was a big turning point because I got into this program and there were 12 other kids in there. I was suddenly like, “Oh, fuck.” These kids have come from actually difficult lives, and difficult family situations. Like who am I? You know? I’m this privileged, middle-class kid. What am I rebelling against, really? But I needed to be there, and it was good. I wanted to fit in with all these kids. They’d been there a while, they were all really bonded. And they had nicknames for each other. I’ve never had a nickname and I wanted to be in on it. I was very excited because after like two months in the program, I came in one morning and one of the guys goes, “Yo, Bath ',\n",
       "  'Water, what’s up?” I was like, “Bath Water?” And they all start calling me Bath Water. Then the teacher starts calling me… It catches on. The teachers are, “Good morning, Bath Water.” I’m like, “What is happening?” But I get into it. I don’t want to admit that I don’t know why they’re calling me Bath Water. I’m like, “Yup. Not much. All good.” Yeah. And then finally, I get comfortable enough with them and we all get close. I’m like, “Guys, I’ve been meaning to ask you for months.” “Why do you call me, Bath Water?” And they said, “Oh, it’s because when you arrived, we all had a conversation and decided you look like the type of kid who would drink their own bath water.” It’s… so specific. So insulting. And creative, yes. Drink their own… I mean, look, I’ve drunk some bath water in my time. Sure. Haven’t we all? I mean, not like with… [glugs] [laughs] With a straw. Just… No, but, like, we all… We’ve all drunk some, haven’t we? Okay, wait. Do you remember bath time? Remember bath time? Did you ever, um, in bath time, take your wet flannel… Do you call it a flannel or a facecloth? Flannel? Yeah. Canada, yeah. [laughs] Did you ever take your wet flannel and lie it on your face, and breathe through it? And then you suddenly feel like you’re waterboarding yourself? You’re like, “Oh no, God!” Or did you ever suck the water out of your flannel? Right? It feels so squeaky on your… What a feeling. Bath time. You know what I mean? Know what I miss most? I’ll move on from bath time, but I will just quickly say what I miss most about bath time is just once a day, somebody going, “Uh, it’s bath time.” How good is that? I feel like we don’t appreciate it when we’re young, but imagine you’re on a shitty Tinder date, and the waiter comes over, they’re like, “I’m so sorry to interrupt. Um, it is bath time for you.” You’re like… You’d be out of there. [crowd cheering] Youth is wasted on the young. You know? Youth is wasted on the young. Um… Yeah, so that’s… Yeah. I think the reason that I obsess over my teens, and I’m constantly processing it, is that I feel like a completely different person now. And I did have this kind of chaotic adolescence, and it was really dark, like it was crazy. Now I feel truly like a completely different person. Like, I’m very risk averse now. You… Yeah. You should see me on an escalator, it’s insane. I hold so tight to the railing. I’m very like… [chuckles] As the thing’s approaching, “Oh my God.” I’m like, “One, two, three, go.” Waiting for my moment. [nervous laugh] If I’m not ready and it’s coming, I’m walking backwards. I’m going, “Okay…” “One, two…” [chuckling] Yeah. Yeah. But I do still… I feel different. I do, I guess, still get that self-destructive feeling. Like, that pressure building up. I feel like we all kind of sometimes have those impulses and you have to find the healthy way to deal with those feelings. Um, I do a lot of escape rooms. I’m always escaping a room. Constantly. Um… Like, I was on tour recently and touring is intense. Also, I tour by myself. I don’t usually have an opening act, or a tour manager, or whatever. I just travel by myself. I have these long days in these random cities in the UK. And I was doing a show in Edinburgh. I was Scotland, in Edinburgh, by myself for the day, and I was having the feeling of pressure building up. You know what I mean? And, like, I had just seen Trainspotting, so I was like, “We’re in the danger zone.” And, uh, I said, “What should I do?” So I go online and I found the Edinburgh dungeons were open. That’s kind of like the London dungeons, where it’s like this horror, immersive horror experience, where actors dress up like Victorians and scare you. And you walk through a maze of hell. So I was like, “Great.” Um… And I got the VIP package as well, which is just you pay 20 extra bucks and all it meant was, when I arrived, they take a picture of you in front of a green screen. And then they give you a key and they project a graveyard and give you the keychain of the… That was when I was like, “Oh. This is something you should do with friends.” [laughs] Friends or loved ones. I do now have a keychain that’s just… So, I go down and it’s me and this group of strangers and we’re going to go together as a group through this horror maze. It’s tourists and families, there’s like ten of us. We’re about to go through it, and this guy comes out, and he’s dressed like a kind of Victorian butcher. He’s covered in blood and he’s got a big butcher’s knife, big beard, Scottish guy, and he goes, “I’m the butcher!” I can’t do the accent very well. He’s like, “Welcome to the Edinburgh dungeons, we’re gonna fucking kill you.” And I’m like, “Yes!” “Yes, I’ve been praying for death!” Um… Then he goes, “But first, I do have a few safety announcements. Um…” “If you are pregnant or you do have epilepsy, don’t go in the dungeon.” Uh… I’m like, “Okay.” Then he said, “At no point will any of the actors in the dungeon touch you or grab you.” So I was like, “That’s good.” Right? Nobody wants to be grabbed in the dunge. So I was like, “Sweet.” Um… So we start going through and guys, it’s so scary. Like it’s just… I’m quaking with fear. I’m with these strangers going through. They do this thing where they love to turn off all the lights, pitch-black. And then when they come back on, there’s a woman standing an inch from your face and being like… [growls] It’s so scary, but I’m loving it. I’m like, “Ah.” There’s sort of a narrative arc where, at the very beginning, the butcher was like, “You’re gonna meet the legendary cannibal Sawney Bean.” Does anybody know Sawney Bean? Legendary cannibal, apparently, and… We’re like, “We don’t want to meet him. We’re frightened.” He’s like, “Oh no. He’s going to love you guys.” We know it’s building to something. And we get to this part where there’s a sort of boat underground, we’re in the bowels of Edinburgh, right? And there’s a boat on a track and we all get in it. And we can hear Sawney Bean in the darkness, toward where we’re headed, going, “I’m Sawney Bean.” We’re like, “No!” The butcher goes, “Okay, guys, you’re on your own now. I’m leaving you.” We’re like “No, wait. We’ve learned to love you, we need you.” He’s like “Fuck you, guys” and he leaves. Now it’s me and my group and we’re in the little boat. The lights go off and it’s pitch-black. You can’t see your hand in front of your face, it’s so dark, and it’s damp and it’s cold. We can hear, “I’m Sawney Bean.” And I’m freaking out. Then I feel these hands on my back. Going up my back, and kind of coming around my neck. And I’m freaking out because I’m remembering they’re not allowed to touch you in the dunge. Right? I’m like, “What’s happening?” The lights come back, I spin round, and there’s just this middle-aged woman who’s part of our group. And she just goes… [spookily] “Ooh!” It was… insane. “Ooh-hoo-ooh.” And she was with her two teenaged daughters who are sitting on either side of her. They’re like, “Mom, what the fuck are you doing?” She’s like, “Ooh.” I think about her all the time. She’s like the mailman. She’s a hero, you know. A hero to us all. [laughs] But, yeah, I do things like that to, you know, to feel alive and, um… Yeah, I try to be very vigilant about my brain because I have a lot of shame about my teens. I behaved very badly. You know? I was very self-destructive and I… The weird thing is I was so angry, I was really angry. And, uh… The weird thing is since, like, 2016… I remember when Trump got elected. I was like, “So we can’t deny anymore that the world is slightly off its axis.” It’s a little fucked, right? We have so much information available to us now, it’s hard to deny the system doesn’t work for everyone. Like, billionaires don’t pay taxes and all the stuff we know. So I’m like, “Okay, in a way, my anger was valid.” I think a lot of teenagers feel this righteous indignation and stuff. But the method of my rebellion was garbage. Like, it was so self-destructive and self-involved. You know, it was impotent, ultimately. I got this tattoo when I was 16. It says, “Oatmeal.” Um… It says, “Oatmeal,” twice. I remember being like, “Fuck the man, you know.” Like, what? [chuckles] So that’s there for good. Uh… [scattered cheers] I… I remember feeling like… I felt like the world was a house that had been sold to me at a very young age when I was too young to be signing mortgages. A house that was sold to me by a really shady realtor. Like, a kind of greasy, with a… A doggy-style baby realtor. [grumbling] “Sign here, kid.” And I’m like, “Okay.” “All your dreams will come true.” I sign it, suddenly I’m in this house. You develop critical thinking. You wake up in the house in your teens. You’re like, “Wait.” Hang on, the foundations of the house are rotten, the backyard’s on fire ’cause the previous owners kept heating it with fossil fuels exclusively. So my reaction was, I thought, “All right, I’ll just bulldoze the house with myself in it.” And of course, now I realize what I should have done is put any amount of energy into fixing the house, right? That’s what we need to do is… That’s hopefully what we’re trying to do. We have to, right? Put some energy into making the house a nicer place to live. ‘Cause it won’t do it… Yeah. [crowd cheering] I do feel we have to consciously do it. Or else it won’t happen. You know? Um… And that’s why I am really… I love… I feel like Gen Z is incredible. I don’t believe that they’re just on TikTok. I think they’re wicked. They’re out there. They’re doing stuff. You know, protesting climate change and dismantling rigid gender binaries. What was I doing? I was slithering around being like, “Does anyone have any acid?” [laughs awkwardly] Just like useless behavior. And they’re wicked. I want to talk about… I want to talk about, like, the gender thing for a sec. So… [crowd cheering] Just because I’ve been in the UK, and now I’m in the States, and in both places there’s a real hysteria right now around gender and gender identity. And I think part of it comes from this misconception that it’s a recent Gen Z fad. Or a millennial fad, right? To have this fluidity around gender, it’s like… Of course… As long as there’s been human civilization, we know, right, there’s been variances in gender. There’s been different cultures that recognize third and fourth genders. Not just recognize, revere. Like I could have been revered. I could have been revered. It sucks. And instead I’m like, “Which bathroom am I allowed to use, please?” Um… And really it is a recent colonial fad to have this very rigid gender binary. It’s really like we just went around the world bulldozing over the nuances of all these beautiful things. Um… In the UK, where I’ve been living, I remember in 2018, India decriminalized homosexuality, and it was great. Like, big celebration, really exciting, but it was really frustrating ’cause the coverage of it on the news in the UK was so smug. It was like, “It’s about time, India.” And it’s like, England went into India and criminalized homosexuality in 1896. Like, it’s… It’s the ultimate gaslighting. It’s like lighting someone’s house on fire and being like, “It’s really awkward how long it’s taking out to put that out.” “It’s so embarrassing.” [crowd cheering] Yeah. Thanks. Um… Yeah. And the annoying thing is I don’t really want to talk about gender because it’s kind of lose-lose, right? Especially if it’s something that personally affects you and you care about then it’s hard to debate. You get emotional, you’ve already lost. ‘Cause you’re like… [frustrated whimpering] Like, it’s hard, but I feel like I should talk about it because everyone else is. Like, comedians. Big multimillionaire comedians, in their stand-up specials are, like, taking shots and punching down at a time when trans rights are so tenuous, a',\n",
       "  'nd slipping backwards, it’s just not… Yeah. And, uh… [applause] No, no, no. But I feel… You’re like, “Yeah, they’re slipping backwards, yeah.” No, just kidding. I’m suddenly like, “Oh, fuck.” [Mae laughs] The thing… And I watch those specials so I can be informed when I’m asked in every interview to talk about those guys’ specials. But, like, the thing that kept coming up was, “Gender’s a fact.” That was the refrain of one, “Gender’s a fact.” Then they cut to the audience. “Aw, yeah.” They’re loving it. And it’s like, um… I feel like I’m kind of preaching to the choir a little here, but just to quickly say… Of course, biological sex is real. It’s a thing. Within that, there’s tons of variation, it’s very much like… Scientifically, it’s not as binary as we think. There’s intersex people, there’s hormonal variation, all kinds of stuff. But, yeah, for sure, biological sex, no one denies is real, but gender is so much more ephemeral and much more what to do with what’s in here and in here. Very much like, you know, a social construct. And more fluid. And the way I explain it to people who are trying to understand the difference between biological sex and gender is I picture the gender spectrum. You know the movie Beauty and the Beast? Okay. So imagine if at one end of the gender spectrum, you have Gaston. You remember him? He’s like, “No one fights like…” Hot. He’s hot. He’s like extreme masculinity. On the other end of the spectrum you have Belle, who has Stockholm Syndrome. So dark, but, um… But, guys, she’s still an excellent role model because she can read. She loves a book. You got to hand it to her. Um… And then in the middle of the spectrum, you have the candlestick, right? You have Lumière. And I really relate to Lumière. I connect with Lumière. And obviously the more we empower Lumière, the more fun Gaston and Belle are gonna have. Lumière’s throwing parties. They’re like, “Be my guest!” Yeah. I have this fantasy. I have this fantasy that like… It’s a really clear image in my head of… You got Dave Chappelle, Ricky Gervais, Louis C.K. Throw Joe Rogan in there. And they’re eating a hog roast. In this fantasy, it’s a huge hog, and they’re ripping the flesh off it. [chomping sounds] They’re drinking goblets of mead. That medieval drink. They’re throwing their money. And then they turn the TV on and they see me doing my little Beauty and the Beast gender… Just like… “And the candlestick.” And they’re watching it, and are like, “Oh my God, we… Guys.” “We were wrong.” “Oh.” And then they just… [crowd cheering] That’s my fantasy. Then they just like… You know what I want? I want them to… I want them to cradle each other. I want them to hold each other gently, and just gently rock. I want them to re-parent themselves, basically. Just give a little… That. ‘Cause I do understand too. I get it. It’s hard to learn new language. You know? Although, is it? Like… Omicron, you know? We picked that up pretty fast. Um… But the… The joke I always hear, and this has been a joke… This was hack in the ’90s, this joke. It’s come back with a vengeance on the stand-up circuit. It’s like, “Well, like, I identify as a cactus.” Or, “I identify as a lamp post,” or this inanimate object. And it’s like… Um, yeah, I’m non-binary, which is under the banner of trans identity. In that like the sex I was assigned at birth doesn’t feel like it fit. [giggles awkwardly] Um… And, uh… But it’s like, I don’t want to necessarily identify as non-binary or trans, I just am that, I just am. And to say otherwise would be bizarre. It would be like doing a violence to myself. That’s what it would feel like. It would be like the hot tomato soup thing, times a hundred, just full of tomato soup. It’s tricky because it’s like… You just have to take my word for it that I know who I am. It’s so hard saying that to people. It’s like, I just… You just have to take my word for it. I am certain of it. And it’s like… I may not be certain if a Toyota Tercel can fit under a moose. Very unsure. But I do know this. Also, you don’t have to understand it even. You know what I mean? Like, I do not understand Wi-Fi. How does it work? What is it? But I know that it’s real. I know it exists among us. I just accept that it’s there, whatever. [crowd cheering] I don’t let it keep me up at night. I’m not like… Yeah. Um… Yeah, so I had top surgery last December and I’m on a low dose of testosterone for this past year. And it’s been the best year of my life. Genuinely. And I’m 35 years old. This has been the best year of my life. Yeah. [crowd cheering] Thanks. Um… And it’s like… What’s weird is, like, I’m not that happy. I’m not skipping around. It’s truly just the absence of agony. That’s all it is. And that’s a low bar, and who are we to deny anybody that? The absence of agony, yeah. That’s going to be my… [laughs] That’s going to be my album title. Um… Yeah, okay. And also, I’m really just so grateful to have the language now. Right? Growing up I didn’t have that language. But I always felt this way and I remember being… You know when you’re four or five and your parents tell the story of your birth? You know? And… I feel like my parents… It sounds like they were always talking about my conception and my birth. I swear we had normal conversations as well. But I remember my dad telling me, “Your mother went into labor, we went to the hospital.” He was saying, “Maybe you’ll have your own kids one day.” And I’m imagining having my own kids. In my fantasy of having children, I was never the one having the kids. It was a really specific fantasy where I was this 1950s businessman father, just like pacing the halls of the hospital. Smoking. Just… Really like a very 101 Dalmatians vibe. Then some nurse would be like, “It’s a boy.” And I’d be like, “Cheers, gentlemen.” “I’ll name it Buster.” “Send it down the mines.” Um, yeah. Okay, we’re almost at the end. I have one more thing to tell you. I’m gonna get my mic stand. If I… Yeah, imagine if I lost it? So, I feel like… And by the way, thank you so much. This has been really… You’ve been amazing. [crowd cheering] I feel like we’ve been through, like… In terms of our worldview, we’ve been through pessimism and optimism. And I really want to end on a positive note. So I want to tell you this Buddhist parable that I love. Um, this is… Stay with me. So… I love this story. Um… And then I’m gonna go. It takes place in the forest, actually. We’re back in the forest. And, basically, in this parable, this man is being chased, pursued through the forest by what I can only describe as a beast from hell. Like, a really terrifying creature with a lion’s jaws and this monstrous body. Its nature is pure hunger. It wants to devour this man, and it’s been chasing him for days, and he’s been running. And he’s starting to get exhausted. At some point, he’s going to succumb to the beast. Just when he thinks he’s gonna pass out and the beast is gonna get him, he sees this little stone well in the middle of the forest, little circular well. He’s like, “I’ll hide in the well from the beast.” He jumps in. Sure enough, the beast doesn’t follow him It stops at the top and is like… [growls] He’s like, “Great.” He’s falling down the well, and as he’s falling, he feels water splashing up onto his feet. He’s like, “That’s weird.” And he looks down. And below him, where he’s headed, the water is churning wildly, and he realizes… What’s at the bottom of the well? Another beast. Yeah. It’s a double beast situash. Bad. Bad news. Beast at the top, beast below. [growls] Like that. And, at the last second, he sees this branch growing out of the side of the well, like a gnarly branch. So he grabs onto it and he uses his last remaining strength to maneuver himself up onto this branch. And his muscles are quivering. But he’s like, “I made it.” The beast is there, the beast below. And the branch is creaking under his weight, like, this is not a permanent solution. Right? At some point, the branch is going to give out. And he’s sweating… he’s sweating in that crease here. You know? If you’re sweating in that crease, you are in trouble. And suddenly he looks to the end of the branch and he sees something glistening on the end. He’s like, “What is that?” And so he balances and he reaches out with one finger to the end of the branch, and he gets it on his finger. It’s golden, glistening tree sap. It’s tree sap. And he puts it in his mouth and he’s like, “Is that? That’s delicious.” Guys, it’s positive. Wait. That’s… That’s it. No. Hello? [laughs] Okay. Okay. Uh… Trust me, I find it very positive. You got to get on board. Please. I’ve called the show SAP. You truly must get on board. Like, this was not cheap. [crowd cheering] No, but I really do find it positive because it’s, like, look. Life might be a double beast situash. That might be just what life… In a way, is it not? Know what I mean? But luckily there’s so much sap, and we have to just to take the time, it’s worth it to enjoy the sap, and cultivate it where we can. And luckily there’s an abundance of sap, I think. Like everywhere you look, if you look hard. You got dogs. Every dog on this Earth. Like a good pair of jeans. That’s sap. That can be sap. The Beatles, for me, are sap. Um… Your friends. The TV show Friends. No, like having friends. Um, sex is good. Sex with your friends is pretty good. Um… Scaring people, “Ooh.” Yeah, if that’s… I like campfires, roasting marshmallows, the song “Bennie and the Jets” by Elton John. Um… Yeah, hugs and sparklers, Christmas lights, all those things are fully sap. All those things can be sap. And genuinely, this may be corny, but truly, this is sap for me. Doing this makes me so happy and it’s sap for me. And I’m so grateful to you all for coming. [crowd cheering] Thank you so much. [continue cheering] [continue cheering] [man clapping] Thank you so much. Thank you very much. Oh, fuck. [sniffles] [sobbing] Oh my God. Oh my God. Are… Wait. Are you crying? Yeah, I mean, it was all just so sad. [sobbing] It was supposed to be funny. No, it wasn’t. Yeah, it was. The whole thing. Really? [sighs] Guess you and I just have different senses of humor. Well, thank you for listening anyway. [sniffs] It’s good to get that stuff off my chest. No, it’s… It’s me. I’m me. You are you. It’s wonderful. Well, should we get started? Yeah.

Let’s see who gets offended. [Music] [Applause] Thank you! Oh, my God, Austin, what the fuck is up? How is everybody? Good? Let’s go! Oh, my God, thank you guys so much for coming out. This is so cool. It means the absolute world. Thank you, guys. Ah, just checking you all out. This is fun. This is good. Gay? One for one, baby. Let’s go, let’s go! Oh, it’s the energy I was looking for. Thank goodness, man. Oh, my God, thank you so much for coming out twice. I appreciate that. It’s very brave, very great. I’ll be honest with you, I wish my entire crowd was gay, man, to be honest. It’s just an energy you want to be around, you know what I mean? I’ve never met a gay dude in a bad mood, not once. I’ve been so jealous of gay men lately. You have no idea. That’s what I’m talking about, man. I’ve been so jealous, man. It looks like a good time going on over there. I wish I was gay, for the fitness or the fashion alone. Are you kidding me? Oh, my God, I’m straight, but I’d love to be in gay shape, you know what I mean? You ever meet a gay dude? They’re in great shape, every fucking time, man. It’s so impressive. Gay dudes stay in the gym. That’s the guy’s name, Jim. They just stay in there. They’re just turning it out, burning calories, dog. It’s dedication. You better respect it. That’s next-level fitness, bro. That’s that level of in shape, like, you could fight off another grown man if you wanted to. You know, that’s up to you. You put in the work. Top or bottom, that’s you, dog. That’s your prerogative. God, if they’re not fucking shredded, they fucking dress impeccably. You guys look fantastic. Oh, my God. I don’t know if you guys know this, but gay men have a stranglehold on the fashion game. They are killing shit bro. Nobody in this world dresses better than gay men. You better respect it. It’s pretty impressive. I mean, you spend enough time in the closet, you’re bound to find something, you know. He goes… boots! Love it. Oh, man. Exhausted, man. We’ve been traveling a lot this year. It’s been very exciting. It’s one of the most fun parts about the job. Obviously, it’s a little taxing as well. I got a chance to go home recently. I’m originally from Ohio. I don’t know if anybody’s ever made that mistake. I never go home. I left 10 years ago, after high school, and that’s about it, man. I go home maybe once or twice a year. I’ll go home for Christmas or something like that, you know. I’ll go home for the holidays. I don’t mind that as much because whenever I go home for Christmas, I stay with my grandpa, and I love my grandpa to death. He’s probably the closest person to me in my family. And I love staying with him because whenever I’m not there, he lives by himself. My grandpa has lived alone for like 15 years. It’s been single 15 years. Hasn’t been on a date in 15 years. As you can imagine, carpal tunnel is on its way. And because he’s lived alone for so long, he’s kind of become this crotchety, grumpy old man. He doesn’t like anything or anybody. He complains all day long. You all know an old person like this. He’s always the hardest person to shop for, for Christmas, every year. So, two years ago, it’s mid-December, right? I’m at my place in L.A., I’m getting ready to go home, you know, finishing up all my online shopping. And it gets down to him. Every year, I’m sitting there, just racking my brain, I’m like, “What the fuck do I get this dude?” He doesn’t like anything. He doesn’t like anybody. He doesn’t have anybody. So, I bought him a pocket pussy. Normally, I would be like, “Does anybody not know what a pocket pussy is?” But this is Sixth Street; y’all be fucking banana peels, whatever y’all can find out here. Y’all in no position to judge my family, okay? Bro, I just wish y’all could have been there to see him open it on Christmas morning because we all thought he was gonna be like, “What the fuck is this shit?” He was like, “Thank you.” This is exactly what I needed.” I was like, “It’s a flashlight, not a Purple Heart, dog. Relax, okay? Stop feeling so honored.” He loved it, man. So obviously, Christmas is a good time. And then we fast forward a little bit. Now, we fast forward to that following February, and I hadn’t spoken to my grandpa since Christmas. So, I call him up. “Steve, Stephen, what’s up, man? How you doing? I love you. I miss you. My Christmas was fun. It’s always good to spend the holidays with you, you know. How was it?” And there was just a silence on his end of the phone. I was like, “Are you using it right now? Like, fucking answer me, dog. Like, what’s the review, you know? I’m interested.” He gets all defensive, and I’ll never forget these words for as long as I live. He goes, “No, no, no, no, no. I, uh, I broke her neck.” There is so much to unpack in that one sentence. First of all, “her”? You gave it a pronoun; now it’s real. Second, “neck”? That’s not even what it is. And third, you broke it, dog? How hard are you going? Fucking 15 years, you forget how to be a gentleman? So, we laughed on the phone for a couple of hours, and then now we fast forward to the following Christmas. This is last Christmas. Again, same time of year, going home, finishing up shopping, gets down to him. So now, I’m really struggling. I’m like, “What the fuck do I get this dude this year?” Like, how do I possibly top what I did last year, you know? Clearly, he enjoyed it, and now my man hasn’t had pussy since at least February. So, uh, I doubled down. Got him another one. I got him two pocket pussies, two Christmases in a row. I’m grandson of the decade, easily. Only, well, you know, obviously, I was a little bit more aware of what it was going to be put through this time around. I had to find it more and more durable, right? You know, something with a stronger neck. Now, I’m out here trying to find a pocket pussy with traps, trying to find my Papaw a trap queen for Christmas. And I– fuck… I couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for. I was so mad. And then, I think I found the next best thing. I found this other pocket pussy that I’ve never seen anything like it. It was remarkable. It came with– it was like so souped up, it came with all these, like attachments and pieces… It was like a Swiss Army pussy. It had a compass, a can opener, and it doubles as a canteen if you’re lost in the woods, I guess. But by far, the best attachment this thing came with was that, like, if you… if you… like, let’s say… you fucked this side of it, right? Like, this is the entrance. This side of it is a suction cup. The idea being, you can fucking put it on walls and shit, if you need to. I don’t know, switch positions, work your legs, you know, whatever it is, feel like you need it added to your repertoire, you know? And I got it for him, thinking like, “Yo, this is so creative.” You know, now my man’s got free roam in the house. You know, he’s not bed-bound, beating his dick like a pilgrim. He’s got options, you know what I mean? So, I was excited for him. But now, I’m fucking terrified to go home this Christmas, and there’s just gonna be chunks of drywall missing all around the house, waist level. “Doing a bit of remodeling, are we?” His house looks like a mid-demo project. Like, “Ah damn, Papaw, you literally fucked from the window to the wall.” [Applause] So, dick sucked down the hall. Oh, Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve. He’s disgusting… but he’s funny, man. He’s very funny. I called him about a month ago, and I told him I was gonna start telling this story on stage because it’s 100% true. And I think the world should know that. And he’s got such a good sense of humor, man. He was joking with me back. He was like, “You keep telling people that story, I’m gonna leave it to you in my will.” Which I think would be fucking hilarious. I told him, “Yo, you should do that, because I’ll fucking, I’ll put your ashes in it, name it Ashley, and then I’ll fuck it. Just kind of keep it in the family, you know what I mean?” Just from generation to generation, just so he can meet his great-grandkids, you know. Just, guys, it’s called cremation, grow up, okay? Grow up. [Applause] It’s not your grandpa, and my grandpa’s funny, man. You guys would like him. You can judge them if you want to. At least he got somebody. It’s hard. It’s hard to find your person, isn’t it? Dating’s hard. It’s a very cliche topic. Every comedian talks about how hard dating is, but yeah, it’s a relatable',\n",
       "  ' subject. Something everybody goes through. You know, it definitely gets harder depending on where you live. Like I said, I live in L.A. now. It’s the fucking worst, bro. There are no good people. Bunch of fucking heathens running around. Nobody’s going to heaven. Not one person. City of Angels? No angels. It’s depressing, man. It’s so depressing, getting let down every time. Like, I just expect it at this point. Every first date I go on, as soon as I sit down, I’m like, “Alright, bitch, what is it? Ask me what my sign is. I dare you. I’ll split this check so fucking fast. I swear to God. Oh, you’re a Pisces? Awesome. Yeah, charge it to her crystals. They were in the moon all night last night. Clearly, that should stop.” I’m so fucking tired of hearing about astrology. I swear to God. It’s all y’all care about. I’ve stopped sending dick pics and just started sending my star chart, to be honest. It’s getting me so much further. So much further. [Applause] I hate it so much, man. I have so many red flags now, bro, and no patience. That’s the main thing. It’s like, I’ve been let down so many times. Like now, if I see something that triggers a red flag in me, I’m gone. I’m not gonna wait around to be inevitably let down, you know what I mean? It’s a waste of time. And I’ve got so many red flags. So, there are some that I want to get off my chest, and I think maybe we’ll find some common ground. Maybe you’ll think I’m crazy, but I think it’s worth finding out. And we’ll start slow. We’ll ease our way into it. We’re gonna start with red flag number one. And just a disclaimer, this one is not going to be the funniest one, but I do think it’s going to resonate with the most amount of people here. Red flag number one is when she had… that… That [ __ ] is red flag number one. Girls who don’t drink enough water, that’s what it is. Red flag number one is when she has another guy in her life who is consistently trying to sleep with her, and she refuses to acknowledge this. This is good. It’s gonna cause a lot of fights in the car ride home. It’s my favorite one. You clapping, you had a… you had an argument recently… Like I said, this isn’t the funniest one, but every dude in here in a relationship right now knows the guy in his girl’s life that he’s like, “fuck that dude. I’ll kill him tomorrow.” It’s so obvious to us, right? As the boyfriend, that shit is clear as day. We can spot it from a mile away. Usually, at the beginning of the relationship, we’ll clock it. We’ll pull you aside. “Hey, babe, I know you hang out with so-and-so, and that’s fine. You’re a grown woman. You can do whatever you want. I’m not controlling or anything. But just so you know, that dude’s trying to fuck you.” And women will always have the exact same naive reaction. “Babe, come on. Are you serious? Him? You’re worried about him? He’s literally like my best friend. Like, he’s literally like a brother to me.” “Word? Oh, that’s your brother? Oh, I didn’t realize what kind of PornHub family tree you were associated with, but shut it down, okay? He’s not your friend. He’s not your brother. He wants to enter your body holes. End of story. Okay?” Ladies, you have to understand. The reason we are so passionate about bringing this to your attention is not because we think you’re stupid. It’s not because we don’t trust you. It’s that you’re being taken advantage of. You’re hanging out with somebody who’s lying about their intentions so they can weasel their way into your life. That’s not a real friend. That’s some shady shit to do. So, we’re just trying to point out something that’s happening under your nose, so hopefully, you can be aware of it and put a stop to it. I promise you, we are coming at it with good intentions. And you still want to get mad at us and act like we’re the crazy ones making this shit up. “Oh, that is so ridiculous. Why would a guy go through all that trouble and pretend to be my friend just to sleep with me?” Okay, I don’t know, but I’ve done it so many times. How do you think I got you, stupid? Come on. Oh, my God, knuckle buddy! No, nobody has been a better friend than me. Are you kidding me? That’s why dudes can spot the shit ’cause fucking game recognizes game, you know what I mean? He’ll do some shady shit and we’re like, “fucking, good move. That’s what shit I would have done. You know, fuck you, but respect.” He is not your friend, ladies. And if you really do treat him like your best friend, oh, that’s so much worse because if you treat him like your best friend, that means you’ve gone to him with all of your secrets, all of your problems. He knows everything you like, everything you don’t like. You’ve probably complained to him about everything your boyfriend does wrong. So now, this motherfucker has all the Infinity Stones to become the perfect guy for him. So, when you and your boyfriend finally break up, who do you go running to? Me. And I’ve been waiting for this moment, boy, weeks, months, maybe years. I’ve been waiting for this exact opportunity, bro. I’ve been putting in work, too. I’ve been sending you memes in the morning. I’ve been texting you, “How’s your day going?” I don’t give a fuck about your day. Are you stupid? It’s about my day. I care about my day. Come on, man. It’s about patience. All I’ve had to do is play it cool and stay in the game long enough, and wait for the day that you come banging on my door, crying your eyes out. And I just have to play stupid, like, “Whoa, whoa, wait, why are you crying? He says he doesn’t trust me? It’s crazy. Y’all broke up? Oh my God, I am so sorry. Oh, some dudes are so insecure. Oh my God.” He’s not your fucking friend. Stop falling for his shit, ladies, I’m trying to tell you. Oh my God! Shut up. [Applause] Now, I understand this is the part of the red flag that I’m sure a lot of the women in the audience are thinking, “Well, Matt, what about the reverse? How about when a guy has a girlfriend? What about that?” And I hear you. Look, ladies, you can be – look, a guy can have a girl that is just a friend. No, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen. I’ll wait. You, as a girl, can be just a friend to a guy, but it means you’re ugly. I’m sorry, I know you don’t want to hear it, but you are just a homie with a ponytail. I don’t know what else to tell you, man. Men and women can be just friends, but one of y’all fucking busted. Okay? Somebody’s ugly. Or maybe both of you are ugly. In which case you should be fucking anyways. That’s why it’s called bumping uglies. Like I said, it’s not the funniest one, but you got some thinking to do. Red flag number two: She cannot have any distinct physical features. I’ll explain. Nobody feel targeted. And before you get mad at me, I’m not even the shallow one in this red flag, by the way. It’s my fucking friends, because all of my friends are Black, and they will roast you within an inch of your life if you have anything prominent about your face that stands out at all. They have cost me so many potential relationships. I was seeing this girl last summer. I thought maybe she was the one, man. She was fucking beautiful. She was smart, funny, didn’t know her dad. She was new to town. She had just moved to L.A. from Austin a couple of months before I met her. Like, very, very sweet, innocent girl, right? We were hanging out for a while. We went on a handful of dates, and everything was going great. Until, just a couple of dates in, I was hanging out with a bunch of my friends of mine who I hadn’t seen in a while. So, you know, we’re hanging out, catching up, and they’re grilling me about, you know, what’s going on, what’s new, you seeing anybody? And I was so proud and excited to be seeing this new girl. So, you know, I broke out her Instagram. I was like, “That’s her.” And my friends immediately were like, “Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” Which is Black for, “I’m about to hurt your feelings, bro.” They roasted this poor girl for, like, 90 minutes. Did I laugh? Yeah, but fuck those dudes. I’m not gonna stop hanging out with her over it, you know? I didn’t. We kept hanging out. We went on a few more dates until our last date, man. We were at dinner, and she just laid it out there. She was like, “You know what, Matt? I’m having a really nice time with you, and I think it’s time we take this relationship to the next level. And we need to start incorporating our friends into our hangouts, you know? I need to meet your friends. You need to meet my friends. We’ll all hang out together, see if our friend groups get along, you know?” And I was like, “Uh, why? You know, why are you trying to rush things? You know, I’m having such a good time getting to know you.” She’s like, “No, it’s important that our friends get along.” And I was like, “No, I hear you. I just don’t… I don’t think it’s such a good idea.” And she started to get really upset. She was like, “And why not?” And I was like, “Because we have the same chin.” She was like, “What?” I was like, “You have like a cleft chin. Like how I have. It’s very strong. It’s a very masculine facial feature. And like, I think it’s cute, obviously, but not everybody does.” She was like, “What are you trying to say?” I was like, “My friends are going to roast you. They’re gonna make fun of the way you look. I’m sorry. It’s just how they are.” “Oh, that is so childish. Like, what are they gonna say? That I have like a butt chin? Ooh, so original. Like, I’ve heard it all before, babe.” “And I was like, ‘Nooo, you haven’t.’ I don’t know how many Black friends you have, but this is kind of what they do. Okay? Do you know that they call you the Texas Chinsaw Massacre? Did you know that?” That was just off the top. She was so offended. “Oh, that is so rude. Is that all they know about me, is what I look like?” I was like, “No, they know you just moved here from Texas to be a chinfluencer, they said?” And now I miss her, man… I know. She was my little Chinderella… So stupid. I appreciate you wearing your best shorts. I know it’s hot outside. Like, this is still an event, you know what I mean? He’s like, “I know, I’m going to a comedy show, but just in case there’s a trampoline.” Didn’t even try. You mowing the grass after this? God damn, man. Whatever, it’s not your night. You’re right. Pressure’s on me. Red flag number three. Yeah, there’s more. Red flag number three: A big red flag for me is if I don’t have anything in common, like hobby-wise, with somebody. Like, it’s such a necessary relationship trait to have. I think it’s so easy to be physically attracted to somebody, obviously. It’s everyone’s first instinct. But I think if you want longevity in a relationship, you have to have that extra layer of compatibility, right? You have to want to do things',\n",
       "  ' together. I think, like, a big red flag for me is if a girl doesn’t go to the gym. And that’s just because it’s a very big part of my life. I love going. I go every day. I’m a very big advocate of going to the gym and working out. And it’s so good for your health, not just your physical but your mental health as well. Get your endorphins going, get some of that stress relief out of you, you know. But I do acknowledge that it’s not for everybody. It’s intimidating for some people who don’t go every day, and I try to be cognizant of that and try to help out the best I can. Like, there may be some people in here right now, or maybe watching at home, that want to get started and just don’t know how to take that first step. And if there is anybody out there, I highly recommend the program I just started about six months ago that changed my life forever. And that program is where I only work out with Black dudes exclusively. Because Black dudes will push you to your limits, whether you want to or not. I started about six months ago, man. I was in the gym one day, I was having a bad day, I was stressed about something, I was angry about something. And I was like, “Man, fuck this. I’m gonna use this negative as a positive. I’m gonna use this aggression, I’m gonna put up some weight.” And I’ll say it was chest day, so I was like, “fuck it, I’m gonna hit a new max on the bench press.” So I go in there, put the lighter weights on first, get loosened up, get warm, you know, then you gotta put on the heavier stuff. And when you do that, you’re supposed to have a, um, a spotter, so you don’t die. And I didn’t know anybody in there at the time. Closest person to me was this Black dude next to me. So I walked over, I was like, “Hey man, would you mind spotting me for this set real quick?” And he was like, “Yeah, I got you.” I was like, “I feel like you do. Everything about your voice is safe. I feel like I can lift the world now. Okay, come on.” So we go over to the bench together. He gets behind the rack in the spot position. He’s ready. I lay down, and I’m trying to psych myself up, get in the zone, line up my hands, get a good grip. And finally, I just get it off the rack. I get one rep in. Oh! I get two reps in. I hit a third, my arms start shaking, and he can see this. So like any good spotter, he has some words of encouragement. I’m trying not to die, and this man just gets in my ear. “Do that shit! Do that shit! You ain’t nothing!” I was like, “I don’t know, man. I’m getting kind of tired.” He was like, “My people been tired.” I was like, “God damn, I’m sooorry.” It was only like 255, you had white guilt on top, that’s like 500 pounds, man. I was like, “Is this pre-workout or a history lesson? What are we doing, dog?” I racked that shit up. I was like, “I appreciate you, man. I was struggling at the end.” He was like, “You don’t know struggle.” Fuck man, can’t have anything. So, that’s my new routine. Whenever somebody’s like, “You look good, Matt. You on a diet?” I’m like, “Yeah, it’s called White Watchers. You should try it. It’s when black people watch white people struggle. You will sweat, I promise you.” This is one of the whitest crowds I’ve ever seen in my entire life. Bro, I’m uncomfortable. You know, there’s so… Is this a comedy show or a meeting? God Damn! Oh my gosh. I’m sorry. Um, we could try something different. This could be fun, or it could be a fucking nightmare, but I think we can have fun. Um, so the thing is, it’s like, I could do red flags for hours, right? And they can be funny. We could all laugh, have a guaranteed good time, but who wants to do that? So, and a lot of times, I don’t like to do a lot of red flags because it is very male to female, you know? It’s listing things that men don’t like about women, and I don’t want that to be unfair, one-sided, or sexist. So, to even it out, sometimes I am genuinely curious. Like, for the women in the audience, what might be some red flags for a guy if you go on a date with them? He says or does this, that makes you kind of be like, “Oh, I don’t know.” I’m gonna go balcony. I’m gonna go balcony. What is it? Is it a good one? Splitting the check? Okay, splitting the check. Um, on a first date? He asked in the beginning of the date? Towards the middle? Oh, you were boring. In the middle? “Can I get you anything?” “Yeah, two checks. Two checks would be alright. Yeah, yeah.” So, where did you say you were from? How recently was this? Five months ago? Okay, and you’re still upset… Um, so hold on, where did you go to eat? What is it? The Gin and Temple? What is that? [Applause] Rude. What kind of restaurant is that? Yeah, yeah, catfish and steak. [Music] It’s like a Roadhouse, an expensive Roadhouse. Okay, well, yeah, I mean, maybe did you like him until that moment? Did you like him? [Applause] I’m curious. Until he asked to split the check, were you like, “This is going good?” You were… Fuck. Did you sleep with him? Wow. Oh my God. He split you and the check in one night! [Applause] Oh my God. [Applause] Did he leave a big tip? That was an unnecessary detail. Would did you say? He was sweaty after? Yeah, my man was putting in work. That’s just… That’s good… I think. Well, I’m sorry you got half of a meal. All right, well, one for one. What’s another fun one? \\xa0Do you have a fun one? What is it? This is going to get cancelable. Let’s do it. So, you said it when he says he’s on hormone therapy, but he’s just fucking jacked. So, hormone therapy, what’s that supposed to do? Balance it out, basically? So, what he says, he has too much like natural testosterone. He doesn’t have enough. Okay. How long have you been seeing this man? 25 years. [Applause] What? Where’d you meet him? You met him when you were kids. So, he tells you he’s going on hormone therapy to get more testosterone, but you think he’s on steroids, you know? So, did you find them? Could you get me some? Thank you. I’m trying to get in gay shape, dog. Let’s go. I’m taking all the shortcuts. You did find some. Was it a needle or a pill? [Applause] She said she thinks he is in gay shape. The plot thickens. Oh my God, this is the bigger red flag now. He has his workout buddies. Do you have a picture of him? I want to see what his gaydar says about… Oh, God damn it. The phones are locked up. God damn, your phone isn’t a hormone blocker. God damn it. Okay, after the show, I want to see this. Yeah, that’s a valid red flag. You don’t want somebody who’s lying about an obvious appearance thing. Like, if you’re clearly on steroids, just open up, it’s fine. It’s fine to do it, if that’s the body you want and the life you want to live. You chicken fucking can do that. It’s fine, as long as you can still get your dick up, you’re fine. If you can’t, then it’s not okay. Stop what you’re doing immediately. Okay… Let’s unlock her phone. Can we unlock her phone? [Applause] Okay, okay, okay, okay. Bro, what if it’s just a picture of me? Oh my God, that’s it. That’s what you unlock them with, that fucking flying saucer. Can I see your phone? There we go, pass it over. Oh, this is great. This better be worth it. There we go, pass that back, there we go. I just gotta see a picture of this guy, and then I want to see what you think. I want to test this gaydar. Let’s go. Ah, damn bro. He had the traps that my grandpa’s pocket wishes it had. [Applause] Why is his neck so big? Oh my God, this looks so unsure. Okay, resident gay, what are we thinking? What are we thinking? What is it? The pose? He’s gay? Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Ding! Any excuse to drink, go ahead! [Applause] Let’s go. Whenever we out again an angel gets his wings. This is good, this is good, everybody knows that. Okay, two for two, good about to see. All right, that was good. We’re gonna do one more for an even three. I don’t know if you can top that, but what’s a more fun one? College baseball? Oh man, you’ve been fingered in a dorm for sure. Okay, good. Oh, okay, all righty, let’s dive into this. All right, all right. So, who went pro and didn’t take you with him? Who was it? [Applause] All right, what is it that you don’t like about college baseball players? The ego of playing a collegiate sport at a high level? You can’t be proud about that? The seventh pitcher on the team? I love how you’re clowning them for that, but Loki you fucked with the seventh pitcher on the scene… Your pussy is the ball pen, do you know that? Strike one. Is it just an ego thing? That’s the only thing you don’t like about it? Because he could just be proud to be playing a sport. I loved playing high school sports. I didn’t get to play at a college level, but I would have been very excited to. Oh, you never… You never fucked him? Damn, you couldn’t even fuck the seventh pitcher on the baseball team? Damn, strike two! Oh my gosh, where did you go to school? You didn’t go to school? You didn’t go to college? Strike three, bitch! [Applause] Oh my God, that could not have gone better. I could not have gone better. Oh my God. Have you tried Little League? For the Love of the Game. Come on, guys. Okay, well that was fun. It’s a fun portion. No more crowd work. Nobody else yell out anything. That chapter is done. That’s fun, that’s fun. I like doing that portion of the show because it’s like, obviously, I come out here, I list all these red flags and their standards that I’ve set for myself. But it’s nice to know where other people draw the line. You know, what are some other people’s red flags? Is it something that could apply to me? There’s a lot of self-reflecting that I think people need to do more often, especially when you’re single. If you’re single, use that time to do some self-reflection. Think about the kind of shit you like. I went through a horrible breakup at the beginning of this last year, and I thought it was such a low moment. I was like, this is such a lull in my life, nothing positive is going to come out of this. But I did some thinking, and it made me realize so much about myself, made me think about the standards I wanted to set. But it also made me think about how much I fucking hate being single. This shit is so trash. It’s so trash. People over-hype the fuck out of being single, don’t they? Especially the freedom aspect of it. As soon as you’re single again, all your friends are like, “Oh, you can go sleep with whoever you want.” No, you can’t. No, you couldn’t before. Why could you now all of a sudden? The factor of being single, to me, I don’t like. I don’t like sleeping with a bunch of different people anyways, because I don’t like… That’s not fun. [Applause] That’s not fun, man. I don’t… I don’t like inconsistent feedback. My ego can’t handle it, dog. I’m too fickle. Okay, I ',\n",
       "  'need to know where I stand sexually at all times. Okay, that’s the best part of any long-term relationship. If you’ve been together long enough, you probably have pretty good sexual chemistry. That’s why you stuck around. You like what they like, they like what you like, messes pretty well. The relationship that I ended earlier this year, that was the best part about it. We stayed together months after we should have, just because we had that sexual chemistry. It’s a hard spark to walk away from. It’s fun, makes you feel good about yourself, you know. I was getting my ego stroked daily. Like, how the fuck do you walk away from that? It’s so much fun. I knew with this girl, there was like a certain position I could put her in, and if I hit her with like the right move, just bow, then like, she couldn’t handle that. Like, it was too much dick for her. She was like, “Oh, my stomach.” And I’m like, “Shut up. It is not in your stomach with your shallow guts. Whatever.” I should call her. Don’t call the ex, don’t do it. Don’t fall for it because sexual chemistry will make you ignore all the other red flags, the… you should be paying attention to. Like my ex and I, we had great sexual chemistry, but our communication was… terrible. We could never talk anything out. If there was ever a point that I needed to get across to her, I would just have to like finger her in Morse code. The next day, my boys are like, “How’d the talk go?” I’m like, “It was terrible. This… just sat back and rolled her eyes at me the whole time.” Luckily, I can read lips. [Applause] Hate it. But you know, single again, back to the streets. Now I just gotta have sex with all these women I don’t want to do. I don’t want to do it. I’d rather be in a relationship personally, but somebody had fucking other plans. And I want y’all to think about that the next time you’re about to chastise a dude for being a fuck boy. Like, “Oh, you just a… boy, you out here sleeping with all these girls, you don’t even want to be in a relationship, you’re just a fuck boy.” Maybe he’s not a fuck boy, maybe he’s sad. Maybe behind every fuck boy is a man who once loved too much. Okay, or maybe that’s exactly what a fuck boy would say. TBD. But while I’m single, I’m trying to use this time to be self-reflective, work on myself, think about what are some of the red flags I bring to the table. Is there something I could be working on? And a major one, a major red flag for me that’s been brought to my attention that I didn’t realize was as big of a deal as it is, and it’s, you know, in relation to the climate we live in today, and that red flag is that apparently, I’m not very PC. I’m not very politically correct. So, I don’t know if that term made it down here yet or not. Y’all, y’all don’t seem to give a fuck. So, and when I say that, I just mean like, I’m not one of those people who tries so fucking hard to like prove how woke, what a good person I am, because that shit comes across as so disingenuous and corny to me. Like, you’re clearly pandering so hard. You can be a good person without it being your entire fucking personality, you know what I mean? So exhausting, man. As long as, as long as you know your heart’s in the right place, you’re doing the best that you can, you don’t need to prove yourself on Twitter every fucking day. And obviously, I’m referencing the extremes, these like woke internet warriors or whatever you want to call these fucking losers, who spend their whole life trying to cancel people on the internet. That shit pisses me off so much because they’re ruining, they’re ruining a good agenda. Cancel culture is not necessarily a bad thing. I get what they’re trying to do, is eradicate negativity in the world and get rid of some bad, toxic shit, and we do need that. But a lot of that gets lost in translation when they carry it out because they themselves are such bitches dog. Oh my God, bro. And that drives me insane because I’m, I’m on their side. I hate the same shit they hate. Off the top of my mind, I can think of, um, homophobia. Homophobia is a massive pet peeve of mine because it doesn’t fucking affect you, who somebody else loves has nothing to do with you. And oh, and it is always the ugliest fucking dude who’s the most homophobic, isn’t it? The most toothless motherfucker from Corpus Christi. [Applause] “I’m, I’m not with that gay shit.” They’re not with you either, bro. Have you met a gay guy? They’re handsome. They’re in good shape. They can fuck your girl so fast. Okay, be thankful they took a competitor off the board. I hate it so much, man. There’s such a pain in the ass. And as, as you can imagine, you all have the internet, it makes our job incredibly difficult. Nope, nobody’s allowed to joke about anything anymore. Everyone wants to complain about every joke ever told. That’s so frustrating because, I mean, no, you guys have been here the whole show, you know I have a pretty fucked up sense of humor. Like, I love dark shit. Like, the darker the better, to me. I love that so much. Keep that same energy. Like, I love fucked up stuff, but again, I’m okay making those jokes because I know my heart’s in the right place. And even though I acknowledge that that sense of humor isn’t for everybody, I’m okay with that because I don’t need to impress everybody. The same way you wouldn’t try to be friends with everybody, right? You’ll find your people as your life progresses. So, it’s like, yeah, I might get in trouble, or yeah, some people might not like the jokes that I tell, but I’m going to tell the jokes that I want to tell, and hopefully, my audience will gravitate towards that, and we can all get along and have a fucking cool friendship, you know. And it gets tricky sometimes. I’ll do jokes that a lot of people wouldn’t want to tell or don’t want to listen to. Sometimes, like, you know, sometimes I’ll do jokes about trans people because it’s funny sometimes. Not in a disrespectful way, it’s never disrespectful. I’m just making light of a situation so we can all laugh rather than be touchy and upset. That’s all it is. And this is what’s so funny: the energy in the room is exactly what I’m talking about. Subject matter is what triggers people. I haven’t even said the joke yet. All I’ve said was “trans people,” and everybody in here got a tigh asshole. Everybody, not you guys, but everybody else, everybody else tightened the fuck up. The special is presented by poppers. If you don’t know what poppers are, get you some gay friends. Change your life. [Applause] But that’s what I’m talking about. All I did was say a trigger word, and people are automatically already uncomfortable. You guys are worried about being canceled just being in the room. Like, it’s so funny to me because the jokes that I tell, they’re never disrespectful. They’re always with the utmost respect. It’s… I never want to hurt anybody’s feel… They’re just jokes, just to say some goofy shit make the world laugh, that’s all. And people will still come up after the show saying the same angry rant every time. Just fucking “You… you cannot make jokes about trans people. What they’re going through is so incomparable, and you can’t imagine how hard their life is, and the shit that they have to go through. Therefore, you cannot make jokes about trans people.” And I hear you, I hear you loud and clear. But… the point that you’re trying to make is, you’re saying I can’t make jokes about somebody because of how hard their life is. And you are making very valid points, that I don’t know how hard that life is. I imagine it is tremendously harder than my life. I can’t imagine how hard that is to go through, and I wish you the best of luck. But… at the same time, to retort that argument, you also don’t have the hardest life. You know who has life way harder than trans people, that we never talk about? People on wheelchairs. Think about it comparatively, people in wheelchairs have a much harder life. Do they complain about it? No. We gave them a couple of ramps and kept it pushing. We fucking… Look, somebody– some people are gonna think this is an insensitive comparison. I think it’s a step in the right direction personally. I think if we want to head towards trans equality, we fucking start with better parking, you know? It’s the least we could do. I don’t know where we’d put them, we can’t assign them anything. Just joking, just joking, okay, relax. Hey, look, if you let it be, this can be the most fun part of the show. Okay, if you just have fun for the next 15 minutes, we’re all gonna laugh at some things that we don’t think we’re allowed to laugh at. Oh, is it like a naughty thing if I laugh at a joke in a comedy show? Have fun. Okay, do not get sensitive now. Don’t fucking sit there and feel like you need to defend the wheelchair community. They can fucking stand up for themselves. Okay, God damn it, you guys. Stop being hesitant. Okay, look, people in wheelchairs come to comedy shows all the time. It is incredibly common. You know what? They are some of the best audience members you could ever ask for. They come, they laugh their asses off. And I’ll tell you the reason I believe that to be true. It’s because I think they’ve gotten themselves to this point of understanding and this positive mindset that no matter the hand you’ve been dealt in life, no matter how hard things might be for you, if you can learn to find the light in whatever dark situation you’re going through, and you can learn to laugh at the things that should make you miserable, including yourself sometimes, that’s how you fucking win life. And you are going to be a significantly happier person if you can learn to laugh in the face of adversity. I know this seems harsh, but I just have little to no respect for anybody who wakes up every day and makes the decision to live with a victim’s negative mentality of “oh, everything’s awful, everyone’s out to hurt my feelings.” Only because that’s not fair to you, that’s not fair to yourself. Your life is so short and so precious, you deserve to have the best fucking time you possibly can and laugh your way through life and be as happy as you can, no matter your circumstance or no matter what anybody fucking says about you. You deserve that. Have some fun. We’re only here for a second. Have some fun, man. And that’s why I chose the comparison that I did. A lot of people think it’s an insensitive comparison in the beginning, comparing those two groups. But it’s because of the positive message that I’m trying to put out there. And I want people to remember is that no matter what you’re going through, I would never negate that, but I want you to remember, if you think your life is hard, somebody has it worse. Tr',\n",
       "  'y to remember that. Be grateful, be happy, and enjoy your time, no matter what. And that’s what I love about this example, is because if you think about the life of somebody in a wheelchair, that’s fucking hard. It’s a daily obstacle to overcome to do anything, every day. And the fact that they can laugh their way through that, we should all be able to. That’s what I have so much respect for the wheelchair community. [Applause] Because regardless of what they’re going through, people in wheelchairs are never annoying about their situation, until they’re getting on the bus. I don’t know how many of y’all have been stuck behind a city bus sending somebody in a wheelchair on, but it is fucking excruciating. You’re behind, I’m trying to make that right turn, and they’re fucking… “Put this motherfucker on the bike rack and let’s go!” That is the only time I have ever lost my patience on a handicapped person, is when they’re fucking up traffic. Okay, other than that, they’re angels. Look, if you’re still upset about the comparison, feel free to think about it and tell me I’m wrong. Let’s say you did, let’s say you took somebody with no legs and a trans person and you put them in the same room, the same handicap accessible room. See who you think has the harder life. “I just, I feel like I’m trapped inside of another person’s body.” “So, you have four legs?” “You’re… you’re not listening. It’s not about that. It’s a… Sometimes my mental health will take such a toll that I could just… I could just jump off of my balcony.” “Jump? What’s that?” “You’re… you’re not hearing… People will call me the wrong pronouns.” “Someone called me ‘Chariot Tubman’ the other day. You think a pronoun’s the worst thing you can be called? Come on.” Audience: What about a trans person in a wheelchair? Oh, you mean transportation? [Laughter] Don’t test me, dog. [Laughter] Oh, shit. Look, this is… this is a hard joke to pull off. It’s like a prosthetic leg; you just gotta… No, no, it is. It is, obviously, you take two marginalized groups of people who are going through a tough time, and you think you can’t make jokes about that, but you can. The joke works if my point is inarguable, and I think it is. I think those examples speak for themselves. I guess I just can’t wait for the day that I’m doing this joke at a show, and there’s a trans person in the audience who gets so offended they walk out, and I’m just like, “Show off.” [Applause] Some of y’all are still on edge, and it’s very annoying. Okay, I’m gonna give it one last try. I’m gonna give it one last try to get you all on my side. This is my last attempt to get through to y’all. Okay, I was working on this joke when it was like brand new, about eight weeks ago, right? I was in Arizona, and it’s a new joke. I’m trying to figure it out, obviously a little tricky to navigate, obviously a teeter on a very fine line of offensive and funny, which is where you want your jokes, you know. Have some fun, push the boundaries, you know. So, I’m working on it, I’m trying to make it the best it can be, and I can see out of the corner of my eye, front row, left side of the stage, is a young woman in a wheelchair. And I’m in the middle of like the trans versus wheelchair material, and I can see out of my peripheral vision, she’s laughing her ass off. She’s slapping her knee. She can’t feel it, but she’s slapping her knee, like, this bitch is rolling, you know what I mean? She’s fucking Ah, you know how they’d be laughing. Ah, handicapped people laugh like they’re getting good head, just… Ah. She’s so obviously having a great time, right? So when the joke was over, it dawned on me that I had a very unique opportunity to get an inside perspective on this material. And in order for a joke like this to work, it has to be funnier than it is offensive. And again, I want it to be, I never want to hurt anybody’s feelings. It’s just jokes, man. That’s as simple as that to me. But I’m always open to conversations. When the joke was over, I asked her, I was like, “Out of curiosity, was anything I said in that joke offensive?” And still laughing, this woman says, “No, no, no, no, no, it was… it was so fucking funny. And I want to thank you for including me.” I had never realized that so many people were so uncomfortable around handicapped people that a lot of the times, they won’t even laugh about some of the same things they want to laugh about, and things that they think are hilarious. So getting that confirmation is what gave me all the confidence I needed to know that these jokes are okay to tell, and we are allowed to laugh at them. You know, her and I, we were on the same page the whole time. We both know that’s what you do to vegetables; you roast them. [Applause] Bro, if you didn’t laugh at that shit, I would never be your friend. Fuck you, dude Fuck you, bro. Then I fucked her, that’s the crazy thing. It was after this show. Hey, hey, hey, hey. I’m not saying it was me, but she wasn’t walking the next day. I’m just saying, I’m just saying. I was like, “Can you feel it in your stomach?” She was like, “I can’t feel anything.” I was like, “Yeah.” My name is Matt Rife. Thank you guys so much for coming out. Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you. [Applause] Excellent. Um, thank you. [Applause] Listen, listen for one second. Um, first and foremost, thank you all so much. This means the absolute world to me. And I know, I know we laughed a lot in the past hour, but if you wouldn’t mind, there is something important I would actually like to share with you guys. And it’s something I wanted to address about the special. It’s very important to me. It’s the name of the special, “Matthew Stephen Rife.” Uh, it’s my full name. If you guys buy the DVD, you can get my Social Security number too, but it’s my full name, obviously Matthew and Rife being my first and last name, and my middle name being Steven. And I’m named after my grandpa. [Applause] The same… Pocket pussy Grandpa. And just to clarify, yes, that story is one thousand percent true, zero embellishment. He was… he’s a fucking monster. But the reason we’ve decided to name this special, it was gonna be named something totally different, and I wanted to dedicate this special to my grandpa because just under two weeks ago, he passed away. Um, and the whole show, I mean, this whole special taping almost didn’t happen. I mean, he was my absolute best friend, and I love him and miss him so much. He wasn’t able to come to my first special taping last year. So, for this one, I was like scrambling. I was like, “Do I even want to do this? It doesn’t feel right to do a show without him.” So, I mean, we’ve scrambled together, we changed some of the set for it. It’s like, um, this right here is his hat that he wore every single day. There’s even a photo, it’s a black and white photo of like, he and I when I was a baby. I think, I mean clearly, we were on the set of one of his 70s pornos. And like I said, he, he wasn’t able to come to my first special taping last year because it was kind of the height of COVID and everything. He also hadn’t been on a plane in like 30 years. So, for this one, a couple of months ago, like four or five months ago, when we decided we were going to do this special, I really, really wanted to fly him out here. He was very excited too, because I wanted to kind of immortalize and, in front of everybody that was here, tell him just how much he meant to me and just thank him for every single thing that he did. [Applause] You guys really don’t understand. Um, I spent every weekend with him when I was a kid. Like, he’s the one that showed me, like, all these funny things. We would sit around, watch Adam Sandler movies, and stuff like that, you know? Very inappropriate movies for a job. Um, and he was very funny. Like, he’s definitely the reason I have a sense of humor. When I was starting out doing stand-up, when I was 15, um, how open mics work, a lot of the times, I started out at the local comedy club in Columbus, Ohio, called the Funny Bone. And they would have these open mics. And how those work a lot of times is they’re called bringer shows. So you’d have to bring five people in order for you to get stage time. I was 15, all my friends were in middle school, so obviously I couldn’t have anybody come. So my Grandpa would buy five tickets so that I could get stage time and do this silly thing because he thought I was so funny. [Applause] I really wish he was here to see all of you people here. And just to let you guys know, if I have ever made any of you laugh ever, it’s because of him. [Applause] That’s why, when we were going over the stage decoration for how we were going to do this stage, I wanted it kind of plain and rugged. Um, but then, obviously, I wanted him here at the show so bad, which is why we decided to leave a seat open for him on the stage, want to watch the show. And as heartbreaking as it is that he couldn’t come and be at the show himself, um, fortunately enough, Ashley could. [Applause] So, in the name of Steve, this one’s for you, Papaw. [Applause] Hey, everybody, thank you so, so much for tuning in to this special. This is our second self-produced special, and it means the absolute world to me that you guys tuned in in support of this. And for anybody who might want to show any additional support, we just added a bunch of new merch on my website at mattrifeofficial.com. We just added t-shirts, sweatshirts, hoodies, hats, bracelets that you can actually pay anything you want for. And all the money we are making for Merch is going towards the next Third self-produced special we’re putting out next year. And to top it off, we are going to auction off the star of the second special, not me, um, Ashley herself. And I have signed it for you. It’s from me. It’s from the show. It’s a little creepy, a little sexy, a little gross. My grandpa for sure possesses it. But so can you. So thank you so much again for tuning in. I hope you enjoyed it and see you at the next one.

       " ['It seems like… It seems like over the past couple of years, we’ve developed this amazing ability to get mad at anyone for any reason. Like, I saw otters in real life, which was very exciting for me. I love otters, big fan. So, I post about it on Instagram, ’cause that’s how you prove that life happens. And then this woman responds to me. She was like, “You know, I used to love otters too…” “…but then my husband told me that otters rape baby seals. I just thought you should know. Be better.” Okay. Uh, couple things. What’s going on with your marriage? How is that where you’re at conversationally? He wanted to ruin otters for you. He had to look up that fact. It’s true, by the way. But he had to look that up. That’s not something they’re just giving away on Planet Earth. He had to do a deep dive. Much like that otter did into the seal. No, don’t you start groaning already! But, also, she told me this ’cause she thought she knew me. She’s like, “I’m a fan of yours, and you’re a comedian, which must mean you’re a good person.” “So I know once you hear this fact about otters, you will change your tune. You’ll be on the right side of history. You definitely won’t use this in a bit.” “Otters rape baby seals. I thought you should know.” You don’t know me! Maybe that’s why I like otters. Maybe I think seals have been getting away with too much for too long. Also, whatever you do, you gotta stop saying “rape.” These are animals. No animals are asking for consent. What kind of weird, fairy tale animal sex happens in your head? How do you think your Labradoodle was made? Aww! Did you think a Lab just fell in love with a poodle? That they saw each other from across a field and thought, “Let’s make hypoallergenic puppies”? Some breeder was like, “A happy accident, love wins.” There are two ways you’re getting a Labradoodle. Either some dog breeder jerked off a Lab, and then shoved that jizz into a poodle, or it was puppy rape. You can choose whichever one makes you feel better about life, but it was definitely one of those two. This wasn’t Lady and the Tramp, this was two dogs, one cup. And for the otters, if you want to say rape, all right, how do you know? Did you talk to the seal? Did you get a statement? For all you know, the seal could have been up on a rock and been like, “Hey, otter, want to make a new animal?” And, yeah, an otter-seal hybrid? The cutest animal in the world? I will hold the seal down. And you only care ’cause seals are cute. If I was up here being like, “Otters rape rats,” you’d be like, “Good, ’bout time.” You don’t have to have a stance on everything. You can just like some things. It’s okay. You can find bad information about everything out there. You can look it up on your phone that was made by a child. And you can find bad information about every single thing out there, but you’ll make yourself miserable. You’re too woke, go back to sleep a little. It’s not like I was posting pictures of Kim Jong-un, being like, “He seems like a fun guy.” Which, if you only look at pictures of Kim Jong-un, he does seem like a fun guy. We can’t wait to hate people. We can’t wait to have them canceled, and because of that, we get mad before we get logical. Like, me liking otters could have very easily turned into, “Michelle Wolf loves rape.” And, sure, I have a fantasy, but I don’t love that I have it. Social media has made every opinion valuable, especially if it causes a controversy. Like, right now it’s tweets and Instagram, but before that it was blogs, and before that it was manifestos. I personally love manifestos because you know when someone writes one of them, they’re fucking crazy. And that’s all your tweets are. Your tweets are just teeny manifestos. And you know what blogs are, right? Blogs are a conversation no one wanted to have with you. Even when you were typing it, your computer was like, “I hope I die, I hate this.” We have such strong opinions, and we can’t just let them be opinions, we have to fight over who’s right and wrong. I’m fighting with my friends. Like, I have a friend, she’s really worried about immigrants coming in and taking our jobs, and I’m like, “Well, you’re a stay-at-home mom.” Ball’s sort of in your court on that one. I’m much more worried about Americans taking immigrant jobs. I got a massage from a Midwestern white lady. Felt like a cat was walking on my back for an hour. And not like an angry or a hungry cat, just a happy cat. Trying to find a place to sleep. Then, a couple weeks later, I got a massage from a Korean man, and he pressed into my back with the pressure that he had left his whole family behind. That’s a great massage! You need a massage from someone who’s been through something. You can’t get a massage from a woman named Meredith, where the worst thing that ever happened to her is the one time she got bangs. Plus, you don’t want a massage from someone who wants to give you a massage. You want a massage from someone who has to give you a massage. These are two very different people. Someone who wants– Someone who wants to touch your naked back for an hour? That’s a serial killer. Someone who has to give you a massage? Someone who’s like, “This fucking piece of shit… comes in here and says her neck is sore from sleeping wrong? I work 70 hours a day. I live three states away and I bike to work, and this piece of shit…” And the whole time you’re thinking, “This is a great massage.” Such strong opinions. This same friend, she’s one of those people– She doesn’t understand why some people can’t afford health care. Uh, she’s really rich and she’s not a good person. It is though, it’s really hard for a lot of people to afford health care. It’s particularly hard for women to get maternity care. And I do think part of the problem is that women, we’re still too cute about all the stuff that happens to our bodies. We gotta stop being cute. Like, when we have a baby, we say it’s a miracle. Stop it. These men hear “miracle,” and they’re like, “Yeah, so why do you need health care? It’s a miracle.” First of all, having a baby is not a miracle. A miracle is going to bed with one foot and then waking up with two feet. “Oh, it’s a miracle. I gotta go shoe shopping. Get some of those lefts.” Having a baby is not a miracle, it’s a natural disaster. And we need to describe it like one so we get the health care that we deserve. Like, when Florida gets hit with a hurricane, they send help because they show you how bad it is. They’re not like, “And then Florida was kissed with wind by God.” No, they send reporters, they show pictures, they get testimonials. That’s what we have to do after birth. Get a reporter in there, put ’em in one of those weird raincoats. Like, “I’m here in Martha’s vagina, and things are bleak. Roads and bridges are out. Man cannot survive. Debris is everywhere. I have Martha’s husband here, let’s see what he has to say.” “I mean, you try to prepare, and, uh…” “Well, it’s just… my home is gone.” Gotta stop being cute! Same thing with periods, too cute about those. “Periods,” that’s not even the right name for it. All the names for periods suck. “Period,” “time of the month,” “Aunt Flo.” They all suck. You know what we should call a period? A period should be called: “bloody tissue falling out of a hole.” If you went into work… and you were like, “Hey, I got bloody tissue falling out of a hole,” they’d be like, “Yeah, take the week.” I know, I talk about periods a lot, and I know, men, I know they’re gross. Women know they’re gross. We– We get it. There’s never a time we wake up and we’re like, “Oh, I’m so excited to clean up a crime scene.” It does make you wonder, though. Are there more women who murder? We’ve just been so good at getting out blood. A skill we learned at age 11. Like, “No one must know.” Yeah, I clean out my vagina once a month, I think I can clean up a body twice a year. Periods are gross. I know they’re gross, but I talk about them a lot because I want men to be more comfortable. But then, I was thinking how women, how we would act if men were the ones who got periods. And you know what? I don’t think we would be very nice. I think as soon as a man got his period, we’d be like, “Get in the shed, Kevin. Kevin, get in the shed. No, you’re very leaky. And when you’re in the house, you’re only on the linoleum. Don’t you– Don’t you dare go in my li',\n",
       "  'ving room. That is a new slip cover and you’re very leaky. You’re just like your father.” Of course, women, I also think we’d have to participate a lot more in male periods. You know? But you know, women, we would have to be the ones to remind men to change their tampons. You know we would. We’d have to be like, “When was the last time… you changed your tampon? Babe? Babe?” “Oh, it was, um… Oh… oh… three years ago. But I took it out, I flipped it around, and I put it back in, so…” “Oh, no, little buddy.” I think that’s probably what male tampons would be called: “little buddies.” And I do think they’d be more fun. I think men would have more fun with this. Like, all the strings would have little superheroes on the ends. One would just have, like, Spider-Man shooting up a web. Another one’s got Batman. It’s like, “When Batman’s face turns red, get him out of the cave.” I probably just upset some men. They were like, “I was on board with this whole male period thing, until you combined DC and Marvel. How are they supposed to be in the same box when they’re not even in the same universe?” But the more I think about men having periods, the more it feels like it fits society better. Like, you know how women, how, like, when we get our period, we get, like, a little bit emotional? Just a little. You probably don’t even notice. And if you dare say anything about it, we get really angry. You know, you’ll be like, “Is it–” You’re hiding behind a couch. “Is this– is this ’cause of your period?” And we’ll be, like, “No! I mean, a little, but no. These feelings are… justified!” I think that time would be very different if men got periods. I think we’d really look forward to it. We’d be like, “Are you about to get emotional? Yeah, let’s do this. Uh, where’d we leave off? Your dad, kindergarten, go.” We’d cancel plans all the time. We’d be like, “I’m so sorry, I can’t go to book club, my husband’s about to get his period, and we’re gonna cry together.” And, like, when we first get our periods, a lot of us are in school, and we’re really quiet about it. You know, we’ll whisper, we’ll be like… “Hey, does anyone have, like, a tampon, or, um, a sock, or… or, like, a really big Band-Aid?” Like, even when you get home, your mom will come talk to you about it, but she’s still quiet. You know, she’s like… “So you got your period? Do you have any questions?” “Yeah, do we still have to whisper here?” “Yeah, the cat’s in the house.” I think, uh, men would be quite loud about their periods. I think, first of all, regardless if it were true or not, every man would want you to know that he has a very heavy flow. “I have a heavy flow and an important job! You can ask anyone in college. They called me The Flowmeister.” I think dads– Dads would be so excited when their son got his period. You know, he’d be like, “My boy is a man. Come out here, son.” The son comes out of the bathroom, there’s blood on his legs, he’s like… “Yeah!” Takes it, wipes it under his eyes. “Rambo: First Blood!” The dad’s like, “Son, I don’t want to get too emotional about this because we both do have our periods… I’ve already synced up with my boy.” “I don’t want to get too emotional about this, but I did want to give you something. It’s a Captain America tampon.” It was my father’s. Just remember to flip it around before you…” Gross, gross, disgusting. I was thinking about it. Like, could you even– Could you even put a tampon back in after you took it out? You know, it’d be, like, all squishy. Ugh. Gross, I know. I think we’d be able to figure it out, though, you know? We seem to be able to do it with your semi-hard penises. Yeah, we didn’t have to go there, but here we are. Just really turned down that street and now we live here. It’s gross. The stuff that happens to women is gross. Periods, gross. Birth? That’s– That’s one of the reasons I’m not sure I want to have kids. Birth seems terrible. And I don’t care how many times you try to trick me with those adorable pictures of your new baby up against your chest. I know underneath that sheet is a car accident. Like, if an insurance guy came by, he’d be like, “No, it’s totaled.” “The best we can do here is a rental.” All of a sudden, the husband perks up. He’s like, “Well, what kind of rental are we talking about? Like, a mid-sized Japanese?” Birth is gross, but it’s crazy, ’cause, like, humans are the only animals that seem to have that much trouble giving birth. You ever watch other animals give birth? You can find it online. It’s not porn. Unless you want it to be. Anything’s porn if you masturbate to it. Just take that one home with you. I would give birth– I would give birth if we could give birth like giraffes. First of all, there’s a lady giraffe, she doesn’t even look pregnant, she looks great. She has, like, a summer body. Spots are in, she looks amazing. And then, all of a sudden, out of what I can only assume is her gaping vagina, a baby giraffe just falls six feet to the ground. The bitch doesn’t even bend her knees! She’s just like, “Life’s hard, learn it now!” There’s a crumpled, gooey giraffe at her feet. She doesn’t make a face, she doesn’t make a sound, she just walks away, and she’s like, “Are you coming? We’re late.” “Fix your wobbly legs or you’re gonna die.” Seems like a good mom. I don’t know– I don’t know if I want to have a baby, because I don’t think I’d be that responsible. Like, I would want to breastfeed, but only because I want to use breast milk the way a clown uses a flower with water in it. Like, always going up to people, like, “Hey, how are you? Pew, pew!” I’d try to get a job as a tollbooth operator. Like, “Sorry, E-ZPass is down, but keep the change.” I don’t know if I should have a baby because I don’t think childhood should be fun. I think childhood should be miserable so the rest of your life feels pretty okay. Like, think about it. We were all kids. We were kids and we believed in magic. And then a bunch of shit happened, and now we’re like, “When can we drink?” It, like, makes me jealous of those kids that are born in a basement to a kidnapped mom, because… I’m gonna justify, you guys gotta trust me. …because there’s no way the second half of that kid’s life isn’t better. He escapes, he’s like, “Yeah, I’m an accountant, I have a window. This is amazing.” “I know what day it is. And, like, of the week, not 8,942.” By the way, do you think those guys that have those basement prison families… What? I think about ’em a lot. I think– I think I’m like most women. I think about what I would do if I ever got kidnapped. But this is how competitive I am. I don’t think about how I would escape, I think about how I become the upstairs lady. Like, I try to tell jokes, I always put the lotion in the basket. And then one day he’s like, “Claire!” That’s not my name, it’s the name he gave me. “Claire, to the living room.” And I’m like… “Yeah!” I high-five all the other women on the way up. You know, but they’re in cages, so I only get their fingertips. They think I’m gonna save them, but I’m loyal. Anyway, I’ve thought about it… a tiny bit. But those guys that have those basement prison families, do you think they build the basement prison first? Like, do you think they’re part of the “if you build it” community? Or do you think they kidnap a lady, and then they’re like, “I am so sorry, I’m not prepared”? “Honestly, I can’t believe you got in the van. That was crazy, I wouldn’t have done that. I’m gonna have to run to Home Depot. Don’t go anywhere. Just kidding, you can’t, you’re chained to a radiator.” Yeah, that… That joke got dark. I think the whole point of that joke is, check your neighbor’s basement. Once a year, randomly, especially if he’s a nice guy. ‘Cause we all watch those murder documentaries. We all watch them, right before bed, for some reason. And they interview the neighbors, and the neighbors always say the same thing. The neighbors are always like, “Well, you know, I just can’t believe it. I’m shocked. Well, he was always such a nice guy.” Yeah, of course he’s nice. He’s doing the thing he loves. Not a lot of people get to follow their passions. If you’re ever talking to your neighbor and you’re like, “How’s it going?” and he’s like, “Every day is better than the last,” check his basement! Anyway, I’m not sure if I should have a baby. I do know I can have a baby, I can get ',\n",
       "  'pregnant. This is gonna be an abortion joke, put on your hats. A lot of people don’t think you should talk about your own abortion. I think it’s rude to talk about someone else’s. Plus, I’d rather talk about my abortion than hear about your gluten allergy. Anytime I’m at dinner with someone when they’re like, “I can’t have the rolls ’cause of the gluten,” I’m like, “So I walked into the office…” And that’s just the part about how I got pregnant. I like to start stories from the beginning. And a lot of people think that even if you’re allowed to get abortions, it should only be for a very few specific reasons. Well, I think you should be able to get an abortion for any reason you want. -Yeah. Like, you don’t want a baby. It’s not the right time for you. It’s not the right guy. You’re a redhead and he’s a redhead and you’re worried the baby’s gonna be translucent. And supporters, people even that support abortion, you know, they’re like, “But it is a big deal, you shouldn’t be cavalier about it, it is a big deal. You know, you should take your time making the decision. I mean, not too much time, but you should take your time.” It can be any deal you want it to be. It’s your abortion, it’s your deal. If it’s a big deal for you, it’s a big deal. If it’s not, it’s not. Both are correct. -Yeah. My abortion, not a big deal for me. I left work, I got an abortion, I drank half a LaCroix, and then I went back to work. Not a big deal. And I also think, a pretty good advertisement for LaCroix. “LaCroix, get right back to work after your abortion. Now in Totally Gone Tangerine.” And we don’t talk about abortion in a real way. We talk about it in a very legislative way, but not in a real way. So, I think a lot of women have a lot of apprehension surrounding it. You know, we talk about it so negatively that you feel like you should have this sense of shame after you get an abortion. Well, you can feel any way you want after you get an abortion. Get one, see how you feel. You know how my abortion made me feel? Very powerful. You know how people say you can’t play God? I walked out of there being like, “Move over Morgan Freeman, I am God!” And then I crossed the street very carefully. That was the perfect time for God to be like, “You’re not God, bitch, here’s a bus.” And a lot of people think, even if you support abortion, you’re a monster. Well, you know why I had to get an abortion? Why I had to get one? ‘Cause I’m a very nice person. I did one of the nicest things you can do. I said, “Sure! You can cum inside of me!” That is one of the nicest things you can do! Every man in here should be applauding me! I’m a good example. And, yes, that is how I talk during sex. “Sure, you can cum inside of me! Man, this is fun. Jeez Louise.” And guys are like, “With a voice like that, definitely get an abortion.” I’m like, “With a voice like this, I can’t believe you came. Careful around fire trucks.” Oh, you think this gets any less shrill when things are being poked inside of me? No, it does not! That one hurt my ears a little. I’m– Clearly, I’m a feminist, or at least I try to be a good feminist, but I found out recently that I’m not feminist enough for some feminists, which is so like them. You know, not the easiest group to please. And you know how sometimes it’s annoying to talk to some men about feminism, ’cause, they’re like, “Yeah, I don’t like feminists, they want all men to die.” And I’m like, “That’s not what we want.” And then I ran into these feminists that were like, “That is what we want.” Okay, this seems unsustainable. You know, just biologically. But also, what a stereotypical female thing to do. Women want other women to be perfect. And it’s crazy because I know you can settle. I’ve seen your husbands. It’s why I worry that women will never get ahead. We’re more than half the population. We could take over, but we’re our own worst enemy. We’re never good enough for one another, we’re always tearing each other down. Like, you can see, as soon as women started to organize, you could see some men get nervous. They were mostly younger men. They were like, “Women, they’re organizing.” But older men knew. Older men were like, “Yeah, don’t worry, it’s gonna fall apart.” “No, believe me, my wife’s been in nine book clubs. We’re not even allowed to drive down a street of a lady she doesn’t like. Okay, that one might be because I fucked that lady, that’s maybe…” “But she did forgive me and not her, so…” Oh, too close to home? I try to be a good feminist. I get mad, though. I get mad at some of the stuff we’re fighting for, because we’re, um, wrong. One of the things that makes me really angry is when I hear other women say, “Well, women are just as physically strong as men.” Oh, no… we’re not. Man are stronger and faster than us. That’s just how it is, it’s biological. I’m not happy about it either. But I’m not gonna argue it ’cause I’m not an idiot. There’s probably some women in here right now that are, like, “No. Serena!” No, she’s not as good as the men. And before you get angry, I’m not saying she’s not amazing. She could beat you, the man who gets tired during missionary. But the best women in the world at tennis are not as good as the best men. That’s why they put the women together in general. It’s not ’cause they’re hoping they’ll scissor at the end. That also, for the record, is not why they put the men together either. There is– There’s no scissoring in tennis, and, boy, did I make a fool of myself. It just– It’s so frustrating for women to fight that we’re just as strong as men. First of all, because it’s not true. But, also, it has nothing to do with equality. The reason we haven’t had a female president isn’t because she couldn’t do enough push-ups. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but a lot of our presidents have been very weak. FDR wasn’t sitting with a blanket across his legs ’cause he was warming ’em up for squat thrusts. One of our presidents got stuck in a bathtub. Taft got stuck in a bathtub. How do we not talk about that every single day? How is there not a store called “Taft’s Baths, too big to get stuck in.” Equality is not about making men and women the same, it’s about valuing one another and making sure we’re all getting opportunities. Like, women, I think we’re very comfortable saying we’re better at some stuff than men are. And if we’re gonna say that, we have to let men say they’re better at some stuff than we are. We can’t steal it all. We’re not men. Like, let– Let men have stronger, that’s fine. We’re better at other things. Like, women, we’re better at being people. And this… this is how dumb men are. Men could learn to do the thing we’re good at. We are never gonna be as strong as them, but men could learn how to say, “Are you okay?” Women, we should just admit this has never been about equality. You don’t want to be equal, you want to be better than men! Admit it! You want to do to men what men did to us. You want to rule the world. You want to line the streets with tampons and fill the fountains with Chardonnay. You want to repeat what a man said in the meeting and have a boss go, “Good idea, Cheryl.” You want to hold power in your hands, and that’ll never happen because men will knock it away with their strong, strong arms. Just settle for equality, and maybe a place to breastfeed that isn’t a closet. ‘Cause we are. We’re getting really– We’re getting really mad at men these days. We’re blaming a lot on men. Especially white men. We’re really going after you guys pretty hard. And I’m not saying you don’t deserve it. You have been sneaky little devils. Tricksters, even. But I do think white women, it’s our turn to admit that we are also part of the problem. I know, it’s really uncomfortable. White women are like, “I did not come here for this.” Others are like, “Me? No, you can’t blame me! I didn’t do anything!” Yes. Exactly. We just sat there the whole time being like, “I mean, I guess. I don’t know.” Plus, some of the stuff white men did, I can’t even believe was their idea. Like, some of the stuff was too clever. Like, when we gave Native Americans blankets with smallpox, that was definitely a woman’s idea. That has “mean girl” written all over it. A man would have just been, like, “We’ll stab ’em and throw ’em in a river.” And then, a woman was like, “No, no. Let’s give ’em blankets. ‘Caus',\n",
       "  \"e then they’ll think we’re friends, and we’ll be like, ‘Bye!'” And the white women of my generation, we have completely abandoned white men. We blame everything on you. Even though you pay our rent, we blame everything on you. We’re like, “They did it! It was them! We couldn’t, our arms.” We are the exact opposite of ride-or-die. We are ride-and-flee-immediately. We’re all Rose from the Titanic. We grabbed a door and we shoved a white man into the sea. “Like, I am literally freezing.” I should say, I do like to do all my historical women as millennials. Like, it’s just more fun to do history that way. Like, all the women on the Titanic would have been like, “It’s so annoying the boat sunk.” “Like, how do you not see an iceberg?” That– That had to be the main discussion on all of the lifeboats, right? It was just a bunch of women being like, “So, he just didn’t see it?” “Isn’t that, like, literally his whole job? This is the most random ocean.” “I’m starving.” And, like, we’re living in a time right now where, like, a lot of people are confronting their oppression, and white women are really trying to be a part of that. We love being parts of stuff. We just want to be invited. You know, maybe do a little light decorating. Perhaps take it over completely. And I’m not saying white women weren’t oppressed. You know, for the longest time we couldn’t vote or have bank accounts, but for the most part, we had nicer houses. So it was a very different oppression. It was a very air-conditioned oppression. You know, we were the only ones in four-poster mahogany beds being like, “Sometimes things aren’t fair for me.” That’s where, men, you were very smart. This was a genius move. You kept us comfortable. That was very smart. It’s almost impossible to start a revolution from under a duvet. And then when we did start fighting for equality, we didn’t even do that right. We were like, “We want jobs!” And then black women were like, “We have those! In your house! We’re working for you right now! Your son calls me ‘Mom’ often!” Then we were like, “This is really confusing. Plus, the baby’s crying. Can you go do that? Yucky.” That’s the thing, white women, we’re the most privileged victim. We’re a privileged victim. We’ve seen privilege because we’re white, but we’ve seen disadvantage because we’re women. You know, we haven’t had it the best, but we have certainly not had it the worst. And I don’t really know where that leaves us. You know, you want to go with white men? All right, that’s fine, but you’re always gonna be under them. You want to go with women? All right, that’s fine, but you gotta advocate for black women and black men, and you’re probably always gonna be under them. I think the fact is that white women, I don’t think we’re ever gonna have it the best. I don’t think we’re ever gonna find greatness or glory, but maybe we can be the supporters. We can help other people get there. You know, we can sacrifice ourselves so that other people have it better. And maybe in that sacrifice, we can find some sort of satisfaction. And that… is how you play the victim! I almost had some of you, I could feel it. There was white women who were like, “I will martyr, I will be a martyr.” Black women were like, “No, this is a sneaky bitch.” Women, we’re complicated, we’re complex. I think the more we actually lean into that, the better things will get for us. Yeah, sometimes we make decisions with feelings and emotions. I don’t think that’s bad. I think men, it’s crazy that you don’t, you serial killers. Like, women, we’re complicated, we’re emotional. And I think the reason we’re that way is ’cause women, I actually think we’re a higher evolved species of human than men. -Like… You know how they say God made men first? I do believe that. I believe that God made men and then he goes, “Oh, good try, but… I think I can do better.” And then he made women, and he was like, “Oh, no, that’s a little much. I’ve really over-corrected. It’s too many shapes. That’s gonna be hard to clean.” I do, I think women, I think we’re a higher evolved species of human than men, and I don’t think we recognize that. I don’t think we recognize that men are just dumb idiots and we have to remind them of things. And for every woman out there that’s like, “Well, that’s not fair,” yeah, life’s not fucking fair, you princess! For every woman who’s like, “Well, men should just know.” No, that’s the bliss of being an idiot. You don’t know you’re an idiot. For every man who’s like, “I’m not an idiot.” Shut up, I’m trying to help you, you stupid idiot! You know when I realized men were first idiots? You ever watch a man fall asleep? Men will lay their head back and fall asleep immediately, like there wasn’t a thought in there to begin with. Just like… And then, this is how deep the idiot goes. Men are the ones most likely to get sleep apnea. Your own body forgets to breathe! Your own body’s like, “Whoa, sorry, man. I almost lost us there. You know what could really help, if we wore a Darth Vader mask the rest of our lives.” I mean, one of the best examples of this was when– Remember when we were getting really mad at men for man-spreading? You know, when they were spreading their legs too far in a subway or a train, and we were like, “It’s the patriarchy!” No, I promise you, he’s just a dumb idiot… who was like, “My balls are hot. I’m gonna have to figure this one out. Okay, nailed it. God, I’m so good at problems. I should be in charge of everything.” I guarantee you, it never even occurred to him that there are other people on the train. And, yeah, it’s not fair, but it’s your job as the higher evolved species to be like, “Hey, idiot, close your legs, I need room for my bag.” And I guarantee you, 95% of the time they’ll be like, “I am so sorry, I didn’t see you there, your boobs are small.” And I remember when this was happening, some women were like, “I don’t feel comfortable telling a man to close his legs.” And why is that? Is it because men are a lot stronger than us and they could really hurt you? I promise that’s the last time I’ll make this point. But, also, if you can’t tell a man to close his legs, you can’t be in power. Power is not given, power is taken. And I’m pretty sure I wrote that, or I stole it from Game of Thrones. And, yeah, it’s not ideal. In an ideal world we wouldn’t have to do this, but in an ideal world you wouldn’t have to put a sign outside a pool that says, “Don’t poop here.” Every single one of those dumb warnings are for men, every single one! They did not put up that sign because a lady pooped in the pool. All those warnings, on medicine, when it says, “Don’t take this if you’re allergic to it, you fucking idiot.” That’s for men! That’s why there’s a man in the crosswalk, so you can go, “Oh, yeah, it’s walking time.” On car commercials, when it says, “This is a professional driver on a closed course,” that’s for men! There’s no woman sitting at home being like, “I gotta buy a Chevy and find a cliff!” So… God made men, and he was like, “I can do better.” And then he made women and he was like, “That’s a little much.” And then he made gay men and he was like, “Yeah, that’s the right one.” “That works way better together. I’ll make lesbians while I’m at it, I’ll give them my carpentry skills.” I love lesbians. I think lesbians are the future. I don’t think they know what’s gonna happen, but I think they’re always prepared for several scenarios. But my favorite fact about lesbians is that for the longest time, no one believed they actually existed. Like, men couldn’t wrap their heads around lesbians, ’cause it didn’t involve a penis. That’s how important they think their penis is. They were like, “A puzzle piece is missing.” Like, gay men, they understood. They didn’t like it, but they were like, “There’s these crazy guys, they like a penis in the butt, and I don’t think about it all the time.” But gay men, they could wrap their heads around that. Lesbians, they were baffled. They were like, “No, it’s two ins, it’s not structurally sound. Believe me, I’m an engineer.” Are there gay men here? That sounds about right. I learned this about myself recently: I hate gay men. Not ’cause of anything you do sexually, very onboard with that, quite impressed. I have tried it once, and not for me. But way to power through. I hate gay men ’cause they’\",\n",
       "  're better at being women than I am. Like, I thought I liked dick, and then I heard a gay guy talk about it, and I was like, “Oh, no, I think it’s just okay.” Gay guys talk about dick the way men wished women talked about dick. Straight men, if you want someone to love your dick, be gay! Gay guys talk about dick the way kids talk about Christmas. They’re like, “Is it here yet? Can I open it?” Women, we talk about dick the way Jews talk about Christmas. We’re like, “The music is nice, but I don’t think it needs to start in October. Also, holiday’s over, let’s wrap it up, it’s wintertime.” I do think this is the crux of a lot of our problems. I think men– I think you think your penis is more important to us than it is. It’s important to you, and it should be, it’s yours, but we do not care about it… as much as you do. I think we also don’t care about big dicks as much as men do. Men talk about big dicks a lot. It really… It seems to be on your minds. You’re always saying stuff like, “She needs a big dick!” You… you should ask us. We’re all different. I have a short torso. This is a finite amount of space. I think we should start thinking about penises and vaginas as a foot-in-a-shoe situation. You ever try to jam your foot into a shoe that’s two sizes too small? Imagine if the shoe had feelings. And you cared. We should all know our size. At the end of a night at a bar a guy should be like, “I’m an eight,” and you’d be like, “Well, I’m a four so, no.” Or a guy’d be like, “I’m a two,” you’d be like, “You should lie about that. Or show me a picture of your apartment.” A two with a good apartment is a six, that’s just math. And we should talk about dicks in sizes, sizes that we all know and understand. We have to stop talking about dicks in inches, because I don’t know how much an inch is. You know how I know a penis is too big? I see it and I go, “Oh, no.” “No, you think I’m a different person. You think I’m old Long Vagina.” “She needs a big dick!” All right, what do you think I want out of sex, a hole in my back? To become a dolphin? Which, vocally, does make sense. And, look, I’ve had sex with guys with big dicks. Sometimes I’ll sort of move away, they’ll be like, “Where are you going?” And I’m like, “To safety.” You know, in boxing, if you punch someone in the liver, it’s illegal. And yet, men still say, “She needs a big dick!” No, she needs you to text her back. And I’m sure– I’m sure there’s some women in here whose preference is a big dick, and that’s fine, to each their own. Me personally, more of a strong medium. Small is still not on the table. Small’s– If you have a small penis, you should kill yourself. It’s an honor killing! It’s good! I feel like this is what Goldilocks was originally about. And then they were like, “No, we’re not gonna be able to read this to children.” “Even in Germany?” “Yeah.” “All right, ‘porridge,’ but you get it.” And I know, I know I just said a very mean thing. I said men with small penises should kill themselves, and that’s a really mean thing to say. It’s also a very funny thing to say, ’cause no man with a small penis can ever get mad at me for that without immediately revealing himself. And it’s crazy because we really only talk about big penises and little penises. We don’t talk about what I think is the worst penis out there, the skinny penis, the wisp of wind, the ghost. I blame part of this on us women. I don’t think we talk about it ’cause we’re worried men are gonna be like, “I don’t have a skinny penis! You just have a giant vagina!” No, dude, you got a skinny penis. Looks like a witch’s finger. Are you trying to have sex with me or cast a spell? Wand down, Harry Potter. But there is one important question I don’t think we’re asking ourselves right now, and I think this is really important to address in the time that we’re in as a society. And that is… do you think moms want to know how their sons’ penis turned out? I know, bit of a left turn. In the joke, hopefully not the penis. I just think she had a lot to do with that, and then she never got to see what grade she got. Think about it, she grew the penis for a while, and then she had the baby, and for several years made sure the penis was safe and clean, and then this poor woman sent that penis out into the world, and she never got to see how the movie ended. I think, men, I think you should show your mom your penis. I think you’re out there showing your penis to people who don’t want to see it, show it to the one person… who really wants to see it. Your mommy! Go ahead, pull out your phones right now! I know y’all got a dick pic on there! Send that sweet, sweet dick pic to your mommy! And she’ll be like, “Oh! There’s my little guy.” I have been getting called vulgar a lot lately. Like, when I did the White House Correspondents’ Dinner, right– It’s fine, it was a job, it didn’t pay well. Then afterward all these people were like, “You ruined the dinner,” and I was like, “I ruin every dinner. Did you do no research?” But right before I went up to give my speech, and this is a 100% true story, the guy who was sitting on my right, he was a reporter from Dallas, he leaned over and he goes, “I watched your HBO special before this ’cause I wanted to see what kind of comedy you do.” And I was like, “Oh, glad somebody did.” And he goes, “I have to admit, I think you’re pretty vulgar,” and I was like, “Oh, if you think I’m vulgar, you should hear male comics.” ‘Cause I know all the stuff I talk about, periods, pussies, dicks… There’s other stuff, but we hit those pretty hard. And as soon as I talk about that, a lot of people, especially a lot of other women, are like, “She’s vulgar! She’s nasty! Not a lady!” But men talk about almost all the same stuff. I mean, maybe not otter rape, but almost all the same stuff. And as soon as men do it, people are like, “Yeah, but they’re men. Men are gross.” Which is crazy ’cause women are so much grosser than men! We’re disgusting! This is why we gotta stop being cute! Every hot woman you know shits furiously! And that’s not the worst of it. Do you know how much stuff falls out of my vagina every month? I’m not talking about during my period, I’m talking the other weeks. The gloops and the globs. Which is also the name of the children’s book I’m working on. “Gloop! Gloop! Glob! Glob!” Like, sometimes I look down at my underwear and I’m like, “That can’t be right.” So, then I google it and I’m like, “No, that’s definitely in the spectrum.” It makes me– It makes me feel so bad for women before Google, you know, where you just had to, like, go up to a neighbor and be like, “Hey, you ever get, like, an off-white– You know what? No, never mind. No, I just– I’d rather die than have this conversation.” And, like, men try to be gross. Like, it’s almost adorable. You know, they’ll say things like, “Oh, skid marks!” Yeah, okay. Sometimes I look down at my underwear and I’m like, “Did I put toothpaste down there? Three years ago? Oh, and also skid marks. I got a butt, too!” So, yeah, if you want to call me vulgar, go ahead, I’m a vulgar, disgusting bitch! And I am– I am happy to admit that now, but I gotta be honest, it took me a little bit to get there. You know, I didn’t want to be called vulgar at first. No, I think what I needed, I needed to see an example of someone else. You know, like, I need to see someone else be vulgar that’s not supposed to be to know it was really okay. I guess what I’m trying to say is, I learned it from the President. And I hope all your daughters do too, you fucking pussies!

       " ['Wow. Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. We’re here. This is crazy. It’s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I don’t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person I’m arguing with. And the reason it’s a source of tension is that I’m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, “Well, you don’t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.” And I was like, “No, I think it’s insane, you know, for anyone.” And she said, “Why?”\\nAnd I said, “Well, first of all, it just seems doomed.” You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. That’s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. That’s a learning curve.\\nSecond of all, monogamy’s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that I’m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, we’re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, “Well, we like sex just as much as you do.” And I said, “Sure, but it’s different.” And they say, “How?” And I say, “Have you ever masturbated while driving a car?”\\nNumber three… I’m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think that’s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didn’t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, that’s the hopeful part. The, uh… I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and he’s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we weren’t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We were… we were pretty good. I mean, we weren’t like the best in the world. I’m sure there are better in Europe. But we were… we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, “Are you sure this is what you want to do?” And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we weren’t friends anymore. So February 27, 2007, I’m at Andy’s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation ’cause he’s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether you’re right. He says stuff like, “She sounds crazy.” Like, even if what she’s saying isn’t that crazy, like, you’d be like, “She only eats whole wheat bagels.” He’d be like, “She sounds crazy!” You’d be like, “That’s not even the crazy part!” You know. So I’m telling him about his argument. And he goes, “You’re right.” I go, “I know. I’m right.” He goes, “Yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know I’m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.” And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and I’m driving out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned! I don’t know if you’re familiar with this term, uh… This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driver’s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know. Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uh… No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times I’ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, “What are you doing?” And I said, “I’m writing my set list.” And then she goes, “I think it’ll be fine.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be fine.” And then she was like, “I think it will be okay.” And I said, “Why do you think that?” And she said, “Well, you look so nervous, I think they’ll feel sorry for you.” But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, “It seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.” Normally, I’d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, “You are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.” She re… she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I mean… I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. I… I’d jus… I’d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, and… and then we weren’t. And then when we weren’t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, and… But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didn’t… I didn’t think it was gonna happen. Like, I don’t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if I’m seeing a girl, she’d think, “I’d have sex with him, maybe.” You know, and I’m… I’m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just don’t give off a great first impression. Like, I’ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didn’t… I didn’t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my “A” outfit. My “B” outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. I’ve reached this point in my life I don’t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure I’m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Like… But I don’t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like I’m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. I’m like, “Come on!” “You’re blind if you’re leaving the house like that!” And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And it’s a close game ’cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and I’m all riled up. I’m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And I’m like, “Next time.” You know, that’s how I go for fried dough, ’cause I have a problem. I just… This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? I’m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So I’ve been going, uh, recently to a women’s exercise class. I-I’ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now I’m going for strong, independent woman. And, uh… It’s going pretty well, you know. I’m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes I’ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isn’t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though I’ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how they’ll have those… The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a while… And I’m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes they’ll fall, and it’s ugly ’cause they’re rolling around like, “I’m in a lot of trouble. Like, I don’t even know how I got here.” But at the end of that, no matter what… And I totally fall for it. I’m like, “that can’t possibly be the same loser “From moments ago. “I mean, that’s a completely different person. “This person has much better posture, for starters.” I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis ’cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I don’t know, and, uh… I didn’t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uh… Pfft. Which… yeah, I don’t know if that was the best idea ’cause, uh, we’re heading… We’re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, “Oh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.” And I was like, “Oh, we can just swing back and get it.” And she’s like… she’s like, “No, it’ll be fine.” I was like, “No, it won’t be fine ’cause it’s St. Patrick’s day, and there’s bouncers.” And she goes, “No, it’ll be okay.” And I was like, “No, it won’t be okay.” And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, they’re like birthday clowns like, you know, “What can I do to make your day better?”\\nYou know, and that’s… We’re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasn’t the idea. And so I said… I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uh… But she warmed to me as the night went on ’cause she was drinking, and then, like… No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and we… I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, and… We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, “Sure.” We get to her door, and I didn’t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, “Oh, no, thank you.” Which I thought was polite… But disappointing. I mean, there’s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because you’re really putting yourself out there. You’re just like, “I think we should connect mouths,” you know, and… The other person’s like, “I do not think we should connect mouths.” And those are… They’re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. You’re like, “I never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.” This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, I… I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I remember… I remember it like it was yesterday ’cause I was shocked. I was like, “People we know are just making out with other people we know?” “But how?” You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, “I am not doing that.” And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, “That is fine. “You are not on the list. “You’re not exactly a first-roun',\n",
       "  'd draft pick for our new activity.” I was like, “Perfect.” It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, “I don’t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.” And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. It’s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. That’s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if that’s right? Okay, good. So… In seventh grade, I was like, “I’m not gonna make out with anybody.” And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, “we call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. “First order of business, Nintendo. “Second order of business, why doesn’t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.” I don’t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I feared… I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, “I got to try to get into the make-out club.” But it was a very intangible goal. I didn’t really talk to a lot of girls, and… There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She had… I don’t… The rest of the show is in old English. Uh… She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, “Oh, this is great. I got to do that more.” And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well ’cause she goes, “Mike, you got to stop. I’m gonna pee myself.” And I was like, “Wow.” This was the closest I’d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And that’s how I ended up here. Yeah. That’s how we all ended up here, in a sense. So… uh… So here’s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldn’t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, “Well, maybe this will be like “one of those romantic comedy montages. “We’ll go to the carnival, we’ll get stuck “On the top of the Ferris wheel, we’ll make out. “It’ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.” But I think that when you’re 12 years old, you just don’t understand certain things about your digestive system. You don’t know that you shouldn’t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. It’s basically saying, “We’re gonna take sugar, “which everyone knows is bad, but then we’ll dress it up like insulation.” And I’m like, “I’m not sure “what the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?” They’re like, “We already sold it.” I’m like, “well done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.” I don’t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the “shits of pants-erator,” and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they said… They said, “We like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy says, “Well, what about the ‘I think I’m gonna die-erator’?” And they’re like, “That’s good, “’cause it gets across the essence of how you feel “when you’re on the machine. “Plus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, “which is a nice homage “to the original intention of the machine, “but we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.” And then one guy goes, “well, what about the scrambler? ‘Cause it scrambles you!” They’re like, “We get it, Frank, but who…” Frank is a maniac. This guy can’t be stopped, but every once in a while, he’s got a good idea. “But who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?” And this one guy goes, “well, I have a nephew who’s 16 years old “and smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.” And they’re like, “he sounds amazing. “We don’t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.”\\nI sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and I’m feeling good. Like, she’s snuggling up close to me, and I’m thinking… I’m thinking like, “this could be it. “This could be where it’s all gonna happen. This is very special.” And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. It’s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I don’t think it’s saved lives. I think the only thing it’s ever done is in a scrambler accident, it’s just sort of held someone’s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, don’t talk about scrambler accident. That’s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, “hey, actually…” And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesn’t enjoy the second halves of sentences.\\nSo then I’m scrambling, and… As I am scrambling, I’m thinking, “I need to come up with a plan of some kind. I’m not going down without a fight.” My first plan was very simple. It was just don’t look at Lisa, don’t look at any other people. I was like, “don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. “Don’t look at Lisa, “don’t look at any other people. I need a new plan.” And… The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operator… That he needed to stop the ride, but… The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So I’m like, “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. “I got to tell him he’s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!” And I’m back! “I’m not sure he heard me. “I got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! “I’m not sure he’s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.” The third time I said, “please stop.” And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, just… Popcorn, peanuts… Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But I’m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening. Two years later, it gets worse. Um… I’m at the St. John’s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. John’s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. So… Cattle shows up at 8:00. We’ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that ’cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss ’cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, “oh, have you had your first kiss?” I’d be like, “yeah, like, all the time. Like, every… every week.” I always feared at some point there’d be a follow-up question like, “oh, yeah? What’s it like?” And I’d be like, “yeah, you know, it’s just like licking an ice cream cone.” And they’d be like, “no, it’s not. It’s like sucking on a rocket pop.” And I’d be like, “ah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.” I’m at the dance, and I’m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And we’re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, “moo!” And we were like, “moo!” And then Sam says one of these phrases I think we’ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, “you get that one.” Which I know it’s the worst turn of phrase, but I’m comfortable saying it ’cause I know I’ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, “you get that one.” And then her friend goes like, “oof.” You know, or even worse… or even worse, like, “you owe me,” which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someone’s credit score, you know. So he goes… he goes, “you get that one.” And then I’m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mc’s bust a move. And I’m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so it’s only catching me one out of every five… Hey! So she’s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then I’m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. What’s great about slow dancing is you can’t really mess it up ’cause it’s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. She’d be like, “what are you doing?” And I’d be like, “I don’t pick up on social cues,” you know. But it’s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so I’m just trying not to fidget. I’m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didn’t know anything about making out, but I’d seen people do it. I could see there’s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is no… You know, there’s no video documentation of that area. It’s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. They’ve only seen it washed up on the shore… Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, but… So I’m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendo… All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, “oh, no. I don’t want to be alone anymore.” And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then it’s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery ’cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, “I’m not alone anymore! I’m not in the non-make-out club!” And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldn’t because up until that point, I’d lied and said that I’d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, “how’d it go, dude?” I had to be like, “same as always. Pretty smooth.” As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, “well, maybe it did go well, “and I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,” but… I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didn',\n",
       "  '’t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, “hey, you like full house? “Me neither. Cool. All right. Later.” You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, “why are you calling me?” And I remember thinking, “oh, I’m probably reading into that one too much,” and… And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, “oh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.” But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldn’t even tell my friends, until one day I was… I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, “hey, what’s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasn’t called me back.” And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom was like, “nothing.” And I was like, “what?” Tom’s like, “oh.” “I talked to Sandra, and she said “you’re the worst kisser she’s ever kissed.” And it was so devastating ’cause not only was it probably true, but I couldn’t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldn’t say, “that makes sense. I’ve never done that before.” So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, “yeah, that sounds about right. “I’m a terrible kisser. That’s kind of my thing.” So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, “oh, no, thank you.” She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldn’t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. We’re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, “everyone hates me at work,” and I said, “why would they hate you? I love you.” She goes, “you love me?” I go, “I mean, you seem cool.” I pulled it back. I didn’t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, “you know, sometimes I’ll date two people at once, and that way I’m never let down by either person.” I said, “that seems like a really smart plan. Like, I’d like to do that as well.” And she said, “I’m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if you’re seeing them.” And I was like, “all right, sounds like a plan. “Got it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.” And so a few nights later, I’m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, I’m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, “how was your trip?” And I said, “it was great. I did some shows, “and then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.” And that didn’t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, “but I’m right about that, right? Like, I’m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?” And she says, “yeah, but it doesn’t mean “that I won’t lose interest in you.” And I said, “that’s a whole new clause! “That’s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?” I said, “are you still seeing John?” And she said, “sometimes.” I said, “well, don’t you see the contradiction in that?” And she says, “yes.” And it gets very quiet… Because we were falling in love. Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didn’t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda ’cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when it’s winter in New York, it is also winter… In Bermuda, and, uh… Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and she’s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. I’m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. And… and Jenny’s late. And then we get to security, and I’m not making this up, she doesn’t have a license or a passport. And I said, “what do you mean?” I go, “how do you travel?” And she goes, “well, “usually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.” I don’t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just can’t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, what… what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because they’re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldn’t want that, unless they’re lesbians, although there’s an idea, you know. Al-Qaeda… Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, although… then they’d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, “I didn’t even know I was a lesbian “until I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. “And now that’s all I’m into. “I used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, “they’d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me “and 71 of my friends. But now I don’t see Khalid in the same way anymore.” The point is, we went to Bermuda, and we’re on the flight… On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, “congratulations on your honeymoon.” And we said, “oh, no, thanks. We’re not on our honeymoon.” And she walks away, and Jenny says, “that’s so funny. I don’t think I’ll ever go on a honeymoon.” And I said, “oh, really?” And she goes, “yeah. I don’t think I’d ever want to get married in my life.” And I said, “oh, really?” I go, “me too.” I said, “is that based on a principle, “or did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?” And… She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It was… they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And they… you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, “then what?” And she said, “he died. He had leukemia.” And I said, “well, do you ever talk about this with anyone?” And she says, “no, I don’t really like to talk about it.” But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night we’d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, we… At one point, I was like, “well, we should do this again. “We should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.” Jenny said, “that sounds great, “but I don’t think I’d get a license or a passport ’cause they don’t make me get one.” And I was like, “yeah, but it’s the law.” You know. Jenny says, “yeah, I don’t think I’ll get one “’cause they don’t make me get one, you know. That’s how I feel.” That’s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes she’ll just say, “that’s how I feel.” And I’ll say, “that’s not an argument.” “Like, we’re not even in an argument right now because you don’t have an argument.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument.” And I’ll say, “that’s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.” And she’ll say, “I just won that argument,” again. “That’s how I feel.” You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uh… On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, “we should play.” And I was like, “yeah, but not, like, a game.” And she said, “why?” And I said, “well, ’cause I’d win.” And she said, “no, I think I would win.” I go, “no. I know that I’d win, “and I know that what I’m supposed to say is that… “The guy says, ‘I’ll win,’ the girl says, ‘I’ll win,’ “and the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just don’t have that in me.” And Jenny goes, “you don’t have to let me win. Let’s go out and play.” And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just like… It was just like… 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, “I’ve never met someone who’s so obsessed with the score.” And I said, “the score is what makes it a game!” So we’re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then we’re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, “I don’t understand why you’re so obsessed with being right.” I go, “I’m not obsessed with it. I just am.” I said, “why do you think you’re right?” And she says, “that’s how I feel.” I said, “if you think I’m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?” And Jenny says, “you can’t choose who you love.” Which is true, but it doesn’t mean it’s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and you’re just like, “this is it. I found her. I’m 17 years old, and I’m done, you know.” And… Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, “it was totally messed up because it wasn’t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.” And I was just like, “awesome.” Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I just… I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, “do you want to write an article for the newspaper?” She goes, “I don’t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.” And I was like, “good answer.”\\nI find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. She’d be like, “no one likes you at all. Only kidding.” Or, like, “you’re like a nerd, but you’re not even smart. Just joking.” Can’t choose who you love.\\nSecond red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I don’t… I don’t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like a… It’s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. You’d know when he was lying ’cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And he’d go, “yeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.” And he wasn’t even handling money. Like, I don’t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. He’d be like, “yeah, my uncle’s Tony Robbins, “motivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.” And… We found out that that wasn’t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldn’t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think that’s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when you’re lying about big stuff. It’s like banking.\\nThe final red flag with Amanda w',\n",
       "  'as that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. I’m in the future also. I think we can all see now ’cause we’re so smart, and Mike’s so dumb, and, uh… You know, I can also see, in retrospect, that’s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time ’cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, “well, this is the affirmation that I need. I’m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.” And I drive my mom’s station wagon to Amanda’s parents’ house, and I walk in the front door, and there’s Amanda, and there’s her parents, and it’s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. I’m assuming he’s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly I’m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. They’re both in their first year in college, and they’re competitive wrestlers, and… It’s dawning on me that I’m hanging out with my girlfriend’s boyfriend. And it’s going pretty well. I mean, he… He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, “I wish it were just you and me here.” And I remember thinking, “you could make that happen.” The way she said it was as though she weren’t involved in the decision process, like, “I’d love to, but the boys in corporate…”\\nWell, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriend’s boyfriend’s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, you’re like… “Maybe if this goes well, she’ll see that I’m good with adults in general!” As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, “how do you know Amanda?” And I said, “we’re just friends from school.” And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, “I am never gonna let this happen to me again.” So… Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize ’cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful ’cause it was… In Texas. And I… that’s… That’s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. It’s such a large thing to dislike. And, uh… But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which is… which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedy… I love comedy clubs ’cause they’re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, they’re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, there’s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and they’re handing out gummy penises or whatever. That’s… that’s actually a thing. I didn’t even realize that… I didn’t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis was… was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then if… And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But I… but that’s… that’s not my job. I’m… you know, I leave that to the experts, but I just… I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. And… I’d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, “whatever I can do to help. I don’t see how this could end badly.” And, uh… The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and I’m hung over, and I’m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. I’m still two hours early, and… I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jenny’s parents’ house. And I walk in the front door, and there’s Jenny, and there’s her parents. And there’s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasn’t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, “well, what’s John doing here?” And she says, “well, he and I aren’t still together, “but when we were together, “he became friends with my stepdad, “and he’s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.” And I said, “you know, that’s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.” Jenny’s staring at me. And I said, “what?” She says, “you have a hickey on your neck.” And I said, “I don’t think that’s true.” And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, “I’m really sorry.” And she says, “where is that from?” And I said, “there was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.” That sentence never comes out right. I mean, there’s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, and… We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didn’t have a leg to stand on. I was like, “well, what about John? What was he doing there?” She said, “you have a hickey on your neck.” I said, “yeah, but at least I told you the truth.” And she said, “eventually.” And I said, “eventually is better than never!” And then she kneed me in the balls. I don’t know if you’ve ever experienced this before. I’m sure half of you have not. Uh… It’s like being electrocuted, except you don’t get to die. It’s like you want to die, but you can’t. And there’s a person in your face saying, “you deserve this,” which they wouldn’t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.\\xa0 Even in Texas.\\nJenny says, “I think that we should just break up. “You know, it’s not just this. “I mean, you’re away a lot of the time. “And even when you’re here, you work at night, “and I work in the day. I just don’t think it’s gonna work out.” And I said, “okay.”\\xa0 And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her ’cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while I’d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from “Jen, Irish pub, nice.” And it would just say, “hi.” And I’d write back, “hi.” It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new year’s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, “hey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.” And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, “what?” And she says, “I think that we should live together.” And I said, “no, I really don’t think that’s a good idea. “You know, I’ve just decided, you know, as a principle, “I’m not gonna get married or live with someone. It’s not personal.” And she said, “well, unless we live together, “I just don’t think it’s gonna work out “’cause we just don’t see each other enough, “and I don’t think that we stand a chance. That’s how I feel.” So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, “oh, no, thanks.” That doesn’t go over so well. She says, “why?” And I said, “well, as you know, “I don’t believe in marriage, and so I don’t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.” She said, “well, what do you believe in?” And I said, “I don’t know.” She said, “well, if you don’t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?” And I said, “well, first of all, “you know, it just doesn’t seem necessary. “I mean, is it… you know, “marriage is an archaic institution “invented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. “I don’t want to be a part of that. “Second of all, I don’t even think we have “a common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. “I mean, one of me and Andy’s friends “was about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, “and we said, ‘are you sure this is the person “you want to be with for the rest of your life?’ “and he goes, ‘yeah, I think so.’ “and we said, ‘well, what if she gets in a car accident, “and she’s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?’ “and he said, ‘maybe’! “That is not an acceptable answer! “Third of all, if I’m so in love, “why does it need to be written into a government contract? “And I’m not one of these like, “‘I don’t want government up in my business’ kind of people! “I think the government does a nice job “delivering the mail and suggesting I don’t eat poison, “but I just don’t understand why they need to be involved “in my personal relationships. “Then finally, if marriage is religious, “shouldn’t I believe in the religion? “I’ve been to more weddings of my friends “where the people on the altar don’t believe “in the religion of the church they’ve invited us to! “Some of them even go to classes with the priest “in advance, to more elaborately lie “about believing in a religion they don’t believe in “just to have a wedding in a fancy building! “That is insane! That’s how I feel!” So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, “well, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.” And I said, “why? Aren’t you listening to any of this?” And Jenny says, “that’s how I feel.” At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, we’d been arguing all night, and we hadn’t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, I’m overtired, and I’m angry, and I’m late. I’m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. It’s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isn’t even there. There’s a guy with a laptop going, “we need a road, stat! What’s the code for building, tank?” You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasn’t even started yet. It’s just an anchor looking around like, “what are you up to?” And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, “well, that ain’t your gate.” Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, “I was not involved in this process. I wasn’t even C.C.’d.” Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, “B22. Like hell I’m flying out of B22.” And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, “this is where I’m going.” You know, I’m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, “well, where is this gate?” She goes, “it’s in',\n",
       "  ' another terminal. You got to take a tram.” She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, “and you better run.” Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, “I don’t want to run. I have wheels.” And I was like, “I don’t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. “I tell you what, when we get to the hotel, I’ll walk you in circles for a few hours.” Then I… I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, “perfect. That’s exactly how long I want to wait.” But the tram’s riding away. I was like, “that’s -1 minute!” Then it says ten minutes, and I’m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, “oh, great, I’m gonna miss my flight, “and then I’m gonna miss every flight from now on, “and I’m gonna miss my family reunion. “And then I’m not gonna have a family, and then I’m gonna be a crack whore.” And it’s like, all of a sudden, I’m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time and…\\nI get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and I’m sweaty, and I’m out of breath, but I’m on time. And I’m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, I’d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. I’m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think that’s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, “do you know these people?” She was like, “all I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.” I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, “Drew Barrymore’s character, come back!” She didn’t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and I’d missed my show. I’d never missed one of my shows before, and I’m so angry. And Jenny’s calling me, but I’m not picking up the phone ’cause I’m blaming this entire day on her. I get back to my friend Andy’s house, and I said, “Andy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!” And Andy goes, “you’re right.” I go, “I know! I’m right!” He goes, “yeah, you’re right.” I go, “I know, I’m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!” I drive out of Andy’s small road, and I’m t-boned. That’s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, I’m spun around, and I think I’m dead. No, wait, I’m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later I’m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arri… have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and that’s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesn’t… Doesn’t start crying right away because it doesn’t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then it’s like, “oh, I guess I should be doing something “that matches that. Waah!” I’m crying because I’m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I don’t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things I’d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, and… The officer comes over, and he says, “what happened?” And I said, “I got hit by this car, “and then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.” The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I can’t help but think, “that’s karma. That’s a hit and run and hit.” And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, “sign this.” And I said, “well, what does it mean?” And he goes, “it means you’re okay and that we can leave.” I was really shaken up. I was like, “I don’t know if I’m okay.” And he goes, “just sign it,” which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that you’ve just said no to, and it’s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours ’cause the other driver had beat us there, and… Eventually, we’re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, “well, was the other guy drunk?” And the doctor says, “well, I can’t answer that.” And Andy says, “was he?” He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, “well, he’s heading to jail now.” And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, “case closed.” A few hours later, we’re back at Andy’s house, it’s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, “I need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.” And Andy says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” And I said, “no, no, no, this makes perfect sense.” And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, “Mike… Sleep on it.” He saves me. The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owed… And I’m not making this up… $12,000 for the repairs on the other driver’s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, “well, this can’t be happening.” I explained to the woman, “I think it’s a misunderstanding. “The other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.” And she said, “I’m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.” So I requested the accident report, and I’m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen one of these things before… But it’s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1… that’s me… started to go, but all of a sudden V-1… That’s me also… Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, I’m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driver’s statement at the scene of the accident was, “I was on Venice going… uh, I’m not too sure. “I was going away from the beach. “I was driving. “I don’t know what happened. “Did I hurt anyone? “I don’t know where I was going, “but I came from home. I had a sip of beer.” Which is really everyone’s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? That’s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.\\nSo all of it’s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So I’m like, “I need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.” The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know ’cause I’m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows I’m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and I’m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” I know, and, I mean, that’s what I said. I go, “aren’t you listening to any of this?” I go, “and this guy was clearly drunk. “I mean, he nearly killed me. “Inches from where he hit, “and I would be dead right now. “And he wants me to pay for his car? “Don’t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?” And he says, “do the right thing, and pay for the guy’s car.” And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and it’s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. I’m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. There’s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no,” and he says, “did you have any loss of income from the accident?” And I said, “no. This isn’t about money.” And he doesn’t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.\\nI’m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guy’s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, “Jim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, “but Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.” I was like, “I’m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. “I’m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and I’m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!” At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, “hey, what’s going on?” I’d be like, “I’ll tell you what’s going on!” I’d tell them this whole story. And they’d be like, “you should get a lawyer.” I’d be like, “this is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldn’t even touch this!” ‘Cause he wouldn’t.\\nThe only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and she’s talking to me, but I’m not listening ’cause I’m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. I’ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers I’m gonna call that week. And I’m so angry, I’m writing over my own handwriting to the point where I’m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, “what are you doing?” And I said, “well, this is my case.” And she says, “well, why don’t you work on that in the morning?” And I said, “well, which part of this napkin don’t you understand?” Jenny says, “Mike… “You’re right, “but it’s only hurting you, “and I’m just so glad that you’re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.” She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guy’s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didn’t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still don’t. But I believe in her, and I’ve given up on the idea of being right.

       " [\"[gentle music playing] [audience applauding] [audience cheering] All right, let me explain. Friend of mine… “Former friend,” we’ll call her. [audience laughter] …is an artist, right? And the theme of our friendship is kind of feeling alone in the world. Right? So I wrote this show, which is about that feeling. And I sent her the script and I was like, “Hey, can you make a backdrop for me?” She’s like, “I got you.” And then two days ago, she sends me this. [audience laughter] Which feels less like alienation and more like a second grade speech therapist’s office. [audience laughter] I’m like, “How am I supposed to arrange these things?” She’s like, “Oh, you’ll figure it out.” [audience laughter] So, I’m going to be talking to you guys… all night, but, I’m going to be preoccupied with trying to satisfy her. None of this should surprise me. Is your life going smoothly? [audience laughter] Are you just floating from event to event, feeling good about yourself? ‘Cause I’m not. Most interactions I have feel like when you go to throw something away and it’s in one of those garbage cans that’s got a garbage hole, a recycling hole, and a compost hole. You do your best, but after you’re like, “I don’t think I did that right.” [audience laughter] That’s how I feel most of the time. Going through life feeling like I fucked up, and I’m going to get in trouble. I worry that my final thought on Earth, on my deathbed, is going to be, “Is that nurse mad at me?” [imitates flatline beep] [audience laughter] These are technically the areas of my life that make me feel like something’s wrong with me. Some of them are more important than others. We can start small. We’ll start with dogs. Right? So, I never had pets growing up, right? But I watch videos of dogs and they’re so funny and loving, and soldiers come back from overseas, the dog’s freaking out, the soldier’s freaking out, the dog’s fucking his face. I’m like, you know what? I should get a dog. [audience laughter] So I get a pit bull named Keith. And um, everybody told me, “Keith’s going to be your best friend.” And I gotta say, maybe my ninth-best friend. [audience laughter] Like, we’re cool, but whatever that thing is that opens up between humans and animals just never opened up. And then I go, “Do I not understand human-dog relationships or am I the only person who understands human-dog relationships?” ‘Cause everybody asks the same question, “Is he a rescue?” Yeah, they’re all rescues. [audience laughter] None of these dogs are thriving on their own. [audience laughter] Never heard a story like, “Where’d you get your Labradoodle?” “Went into Bank of America. She was the manager.” [audience laughter] “Now she’s our full-time Labradoodle.” I shouldn’t even say I rescued it. People love patting themselves on the back. “We rescued it, saved it, adopted it.” No, you didn’t. Here’s what happened to your dog, my dog, every dog. The dog was born into a litter, kidnapped, given to you. [audience laughter] “No, Neal. You don’t understand. I’m a dog mom.” Really? You know who else was a dog mom? That dog’s mom. [audience laughter] [applause] We think because we talk to dogs like they’re babies, they’re babies. They’re not. They’re our captives. Right? But we think because we go, “Are you a pretty girl?” Pitch your voice down. See what a monster you are. “Are you a pretty girl?” [audience laughter] “We can go outside. I have to put a chain around your neck.” [audience laughter] “Do a trick for me. I’ll give you a tiny morsel of food.” [audience laughter] “You’re my best friend.” [audience laughter] We try to make movies about it romanticizing the relationship, like Marley & Me. You know what a dog sees in\\xa0Marley & Me? He sees Taken, but Liam Neeson never shows up. [audience laughter] [sighs] And, by the way, I think it’s my fault. Something’s wrong with me. Uh… So I’d read books about loving dogs… Just… Like, okay, so is this thing… Is this for my LGBT joke? Or is she trying to tell me I’m on the spectrum? [audience laughter] Even groups you’d think I’d feel like I’m a part of, I don’t feel like I’m a part of.\\xa0Like… liberals. Clearly liberal. Look at me. Bone-thin. [audience laughter] I look like Rachel Maddow with a beard. [audience laughter] But I don’t feel like part of the group, ’cause liberals are the least-welcoming people on the planet. Republicans are having a blast. Grabbing pussy, shooting guns like Westworld. [audience laughter] Republicans get to be greedy. Republicans care about themselves, their families, rich people, that’s it. Liberals got to care about everybody. Not fetuses.\\xa0But everybody else. Am I right, liberals? [exclaiming] Fuck a fetus. Who’s with me, liberals? [audience exclaiming] I will punt a fetus down Wilshire if I see one. [audience laughter] The problem being liberal is there’s no amount of liberal that’s liberal enough. If there’s a bunch of Republicans and someone goes, “I’m a Republican.” They go, “Come on in.” If there’s a bunch of liberals and a liberal goes, “Hey, I’m liberal,” they’re like, “We’ll see.” [audience laughter] You can believe the right shit as a liberal, but if you express it incorrectly, you’re fucked. It’s terrifying. Ever try to talk about transgender issues in public? Even right now you’re like, “We don’t gotta do this.” [audience laughter] “Don’t go out like your boy. Just move on.” [audience laughter] [audience cheering] But that’s exactly my point. It’s terrifying. I’m sure we all believe the right shit, but you ever… Trying to talk about transgender issues in public is like playing conversational Jenga. You’re like… “Pronouns…” “He… They…” Then Republicans are like, “Trannies? We’ll call ’em trannies?” [thud] [audience laughter] “What happened here? You guys playing Jenga?” [audience laughter] “I fucking love Jenga. Rack ’em up.” There’s a lot of little conundrums as a liberal, right? Like, I live in Venice, California, in LA. [man whoops] Yeah. And there’s a lot of homeless people in Venice. But I’m from New York, so it’s hard to take LA homeless people seriously. [audience laughter] It’s like once you work with the best, you know? [audience laughter] So… So one day I get home, and I got an… email. Paper email. A letter, we’ll call it. [audience laughter] The letter says, “We’re opening a homeless shelter.” As a liberal, that’s great. I keep reading. It says, “Across the street from your house.” I was like, “Oh shit.” [audience laughter] It was like being on a game show like How Liberal Are You? Like, “Uh…” [audience laughter] “I wrote a Black TV show.” [audience laughter] Yeah. My neighbors want to protest and shit. I’m not going to protest. I’m going to move. But I’m not going to… [audience laughter] No, I didn’t move. They opened the shelter. It’s not bad. It’s fine. How Liberal Are You? would be a funny game show, wouldn’t it? “You’re at an airport and a Muslim-looking man asks you to watch his luggage while he prays.” How Liberal Are You? [audience laughter] “Pass!” [audience laughter] You know who’s a liberal conundrum, as a person? Kanye. Yeah, ’cause when Kanye first started, he said, “George Bush doesn’t care about Black people.” Conservatives were like, “He needs to shut the fuck up.” Liberals were like, “Let him speak.” Then he started saying how much he liked Trump and liberals were like, “He does need to shut the fuck up.” [audience laughter] People at this point are just exhausted by Kanye. People are like, “That guy’s fucking crazy.” Yeah. No kidding. He’s a rapper. Since when do you rely on rappers for their emotional stability? [audience laughter] What’s your argument?\\xa0“Back in my day, there was a guy named Flavor Flav.” [audience laughter] “And he’d walk around and say, ‘You know what time it is!'” “And we did know. He had a fucking giant clock on his chest.” [audience laughter] “There was another fella named DMX who’d smoke crack and bark at people.” [audience laughter] “He’d go…” [barks] “And we knew where he stood.” [audience laughter] “His bark was as good as his word.” [audience laughter] “There was another named Eminem who’d make albums about murdering his wife.” “These are normal people we are talking about.” This. Maybe she’ll like this. Yeah, guns. I lose liberals on guns. I would like to, before I talk about this, say that I am afraid of guns, but it turns out the cops are too. [chuckles] [audience cheering and applauding] What’s the lesson we’re supposed to learn from Uvalde? Right? From Uvalde, Texas. Are we supposed to just… It’s always got to be a good guy with a gun? That’s the only way to stop it? Right? Everyone… The whole country’s going to be good guys with guns. Everywhere you go, “Freeze!” “You freeze!” “I’m already frozen!” Just fucking… [audience laughter] Also, if it’s up to us to stop guns, you know, speeding kills thousands of people every year. Are we supposed to stop that too? We’re supposed to run them off the road? If we see a speeder coming up, “You know what they say, the only thing that stops bad guy in a car is a good guy in a car.” Neew! [audience laughter] Yeah, my problem with guns is I don’t buy either side’s arguments completely. So the conservative argument is that guns are in the Constitution because the Founding Fathers thought if the citizens have guns the government will do what they say or else the people will rise up and fight the government. Which is a legitimately great idea in the 1700s, but… problem is, there’s still people now hoarding weapons thinking that, at some point, they may need to take on the American military, and they think they have a shot, right? [audience laughter] And look, maybe they’re right, which is why I’m proposing we test their theory, and once a year have a head-to-head showdown. [audience laughing, cheering] Say 100 m\",\n",
       "  'embers of the NRA versus, I don’t know, two members of the military. [audience laughter] Broadcast it on Fox, Christmas Day. [audience laughter] “Merry Christmas and welcome to the 2022 NRA-Military Showdown.” “Let’s go down to the field of battle, meet one of our NRA combatants.” “What’s your name? What kind of weapon?” “My name’s Andy Baker, and I got an AR-15, wearing Kevlar head-to-toe.” “How confident are you on a scale of 1 to 10?” “Fuckin’ a million.” [audience laughter] “We’re going to check in with the military.” They cut to one guy by himself, in a bunker, and he’s like, “My name is Staff Sgt.\\xa0Jeremiah Walker.” “What kind of weapon are you working with?” “I don’t know if this is fair, but I’m working with a drone.” [audience laughter] “It’s equipped with eight Hellfire missiles and a high-power camera.” “As you can see on this monitor, the NRA fellas are in one big cluster.” [audience laughter] “So, I’m going to…” “We started? All right.” [audience laughter] “Yeah, so I’m going to hit this button right here.” [audience laughter] “Yeah, now they’re all dead.” [audience laughter] “That’ll do it for this year’s NRA-Military Showdown.” [audience cheering and clapping] “Brought to you by Whole Foods.” [audience laughter] You know the NRA guys would be like, “We can take ’em next year. Just got to split up.” [audience laughter] That’s the conservative argument, and the liberal argument is that, uh, the gun stats in America are just horrifying, right? And they are on their face, right? 40,000 gun deaths a year. Which is awful. But, you know what they never tell you? You know how many of those are suicides? Two-thirds are suicides. No one ever knows that. So whenever there’s a mass shooting on television, which are legitimately tragic, liberals always run on TV and say, “We don’t need mental health care. We need common-sense gun control.” No. How about both? Right? How about one question at the point of sale? Find out who’s depressed, who isn’t, and two-thirds of gun deaths right there. Guy comes in and they go, “Before we sell you this weapon, can we just look at your browser history real quick?” [audience laughter] He goes, “Sir, you’ve been listening to Lana Del Rey.” [audience laughter] “And staring at pictures of your ex. We’re not going to give you a gun today, but we are going to give you a bag of mushrooms and a copy of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective.” [audience laughter] [audience clapping and cheering] “You’re gonna be back on your feet and talking with your butt cheeks in no time.” [audience laughter] So now we’re down to about 13,000 gun deaths a year, which is atrocious. But, by the way, you know how many people the flu kills in the average year? 50,000. If you’re worried you’ll be murdered by a gun, think about how scared you are of dying from the flu… You’re not. …divide it by three, and I’ll meet you there. By the way, do you see how I think myself into isolated, asshole-y positions? About everything for as long as I can remember. Even I hear myself sometimes and I’m like, “Just shut the fuck up.” I got to be the only person who was ever asked, “Would you rather be right or happy?” And I was like… “Ugh…” [audience laughter] Something’s wrong with me. And, by the way, I work against all my\\xa0instincts with this. You know, I give to every liberal group you can think of. I give to so many… I give to an anti-capitalist group. How fucking dumb is that? And they have the balls to hit me up for donations. “Can we get another 100 bucks for our anti-capitalism group?” I’m like, “But you know how I’m getting this money, don’t you?” [audience laughter] Oh yeah. Maybe you’re thinking like, “Neal, why don’t you smoke some weed?” “Chill the fuck out.” That’s not up there ’cause I love weed. That’s up there ’cause I don’t think recreational drugs work on me right. Like MDMA. Molly, ecstasy, depending how old you are. [audience laughter] Uh… I… I’ve done it seven or eight times. Never worked on me once. There’s people whose brains don’t respond to MDMA. Guess I have one of those brains. My friends do not have one of those brains. That was pretty awkward. They’re all rubbing each other’s nipples, and I’m just like… [fake laughter] [audience laughter] Yeah, and I don’t think weed works on me either. Unless, is weed supposed to make you violently paranoid for five minutes, then you got to go to sleep? Is that weed? [audience laughter] ‘Cause in that case,\\xa0bull’s-eye. I feel bad too because we’re living in the golden age of weed. Weed is legal in so many places. It’s legal out here. Uh… They sponsor comedy shows, so I get bags and vapes and pipes. I have so much weed at my house that I cannot use, I’ve become like an old lady with a lemon tree in her backyard. I’m like, “Take some weed.” [audience laughter] So weed’s legal. Shrooms just got legalized in Denver, Oakland, all of Oregon. Yeah. Yeah. [audience cheering] So there’s going to be shroom stores. You ready? You’ll go to a shroom store and go, “You open?” “I don’t know, are you open?” [audience laughter] I’m not mad at these drugs. MDMA, psilocybin, weed all passed the FDA hurdles for safety. Uh, but you know what wouldn’t pass the FDA hurdles for safety? Alcohol. For safety? Like, if they tested out whiskey in a lab. 100 men, 100 women, scientists dispensing it, marking down the results, they go to their boss. “Sir, we did the whiskey test.” “Uh, first one or two drinks, people seemed warm and happy.” “Then around the third drink, a lot of the men became belligerent.” “The women were upset, but they said they didn’t want to talk about it.” [audience laughter] “And then a lot of people vomited and passed out, and everyone who drove home crashed their car.” [audience laughter] “That sounds awful.” “I know, here’s the crazy part.” “They all want to come back again on Saturday.” [audience laughter] “They’re wondering if we can hire a DJ.” “And two Israeli guys want to promote it. Does that…?” [audience laughter] So clearly I’m not a big drinker. The fucked-up thing about alcohol is it gets so much good PR. Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always heard, “When you drink, your real self comes out.” Which is true to a point. Maybe one or two drinks. But I’ve never looked at one of my sloshed friends and been, “There’s the real Tony.” And they’re, “Ugh!” [grunting] “Fuck you guys!” “That is his God-given essence, right there.” [exclaims] The real Tony has to piss on the street. [audience laughter] Yeah, not a big drinker. Not a big smoker. People don’t like it. It is good for me. Not drinking and smoking. I know it’s good for me because when I tell people at parties, they say, “Good for you,” right before they walk away. [audience laughter] But alcohol is hard. It’s a tough issue for me ’cause I grew up with an alcoholic dad, right? Uh… and, you know, people love alcohol, and women are people. So… [audience laughter] Admit it. Um… And so dating is tough because I don’t want to be a drink cop, but at the same time, it can be a little triggering. Sometimes it’s fine. Other times it’s like, “Mmm, trauma.” Um… [audience laughing and clapping] Yeah, but I don’t know what I can ask for within this, right? Like, I just don’t know what’s… I go, “Who am I to tell her not to drink?” “As someone who’s trying to protect themselves?” “From what?” “I don’t know, a negative emotional experience? The smell of alcohol?” “Are you not fucking over that? How are you not fucking over that?” So I’ve just got this negative tape running in my head about that and pretty much most things in my life. I have a very… I got a bad inner monologue. I wrote it down one time, and as soon as I saw it, I was like, I got to erase this. Because if any of my friends know that someone’s talking to me like this, they’re going to be pissed. But meanwhile, it was an inside job, you know? You ever look back on your life and think the way you are is inevitable? If you don’t know much about me, I’m the youngest of ten kids, which is… too many. Right? Both my parents were born during the Great Depression, and they were nice enough to bring it with them. [audience laughter] Yeah, so both my parents brought that energy to their union, and it was just a lot of chaos and alcohol and law and order. Like, a lot of violence. My earliest… One of my earliest memories of life is watching my teenage brother fistfight my dad on the front lawn. It’s like, “Okay, so this is life.” Um… Yeah, just so many rules. Just constant rules. There were so many rules that eventually my mother wrote the important ones down and stuck them on the wall of the kitchen, like you’d see at a steel factory. My friend actually put them on here. I’ll tell you about some of them. Bunch of TV rules, which I guess makes sense. A lot of laundry rules. My mother was laundry-room crazy. Um, if you left your clothes in the laundry room for too long, my mother would confiscate your clothes. Disappeared, Khmer Rouge-style. [audience chuckling] Never to be seen again. Although one year for Christmas, my sister Anne did get a keychain, a candle, and a box of her old clothes back, so… Merry Christmas, Anne. Why are you crying? [audience laughter] A lot of sandwich rules. You guys probably all had sandwich rules, right? [audience laughter] We had to make all of… There were too many of us. We couldn’t all make sandwiches every morning before school, so we’d have to make them in bulk on the weekend and then stick them in the freezer. And then on the way to school, we grabbed one of our sandwiches. You’re thinking that must not have made for very fresh sandwiches, but you’re forgetting a more important piece of information. Sandwiches don’t always thaw between 8:00 a.m. and lunchtime. [audience laughter] In those cases, we’d eat around the edges like rats on a',\n",
       "  \" pirate ship. [audience laughter] So, pretty much the Gilmore Girls is what I’m saying. Yeah, so I grew up Catholic. Anybody else? [cheering] Yeah, I did all the Catholic milestones. Baptism, First Holy Communion, Confirmation, atheism. Right? [audience laughter] [applause] I shouldn’t even say I’m an atheist. Let’s say I’m agnostic about my atheism, right? Atheists are such smug hypocrites, by the way. Atheists will be like, “You pray to a god? That’s so silly.” “Can I show you my vision board real quick?” [audience laughter] I know a lot of white atheists. I don’t know many Black atheists. Not none, just not many. I got a theory about why there’s not many Black atheists. Here goes. Atheism is really like the height of white privilege. It really is. Religion says, “Can we interest you in an afterlife?” And white people are like, “No, thank you.” [chuckles] [audience laughter] “How much better could it be?” [audience laughter] “I’ll just take my supplements and see what happens.” White privilege has had a big couple years, huh? Yeah. The Cauckies, the Caucasians. [audience laughter] Cauckies were blindsided in 2020. They were just caught unawares, right? I was talking to a white lady. She says, “I had no idea things were so bad between Black people and the police.” I was like, “There’s no way you could’ve, unless you listen to any song by a Black person, ever.” [audience laughter] Like, what do you think “Fuck tha Police” was about, lady? “I didn’t think it was all police. I thought it was one precinct.” How about Bob Marley’s “I Shot the Sheriff”? “I know, but he didn’t shoot the deputy, so…” [audience laughter] I like the white privilege that’s hiding in plain sight. You know what’s a white privilege thing that’s hiding? A lot of American city names are white privilege. Like Chicago, Milwaukee, those are Native American words. West Coast is wild. San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego. Spanish names. Ever think about why they’re Spanish? Well… ‘Cause we jacked the motherfuckers from Mexico, didn’t even bother changing the names. [audience laughter] That is some ice-cold white privilege shit. That’d be like if your boy Pete had a girlfriend for years. “Pete’s girl.” Then you steal her, take her to a party, you’re like, “You know my girl Pete’s girl, don’t you?” [audience laughter] “You thirsty, baby? Get Pete’s girl a drink, would you?” “I got you a necklace with your initials on it. PG. Pete’s girl.” You know what’s white privilege? Joking about race. That’s white privilege. ‘Cause as a white person, it just bounces right off. Right? I know the funniest, meanest Black dudes in the world. They’ll be like, “White people can’t dance. No rhythm.” I’ll be like, “Who needs rhythm when you own the record label?” [audience laughter] [audience continues laughing] Am I TikToking? Be honest. Is this TikTok? [audience laughter] A lot of Cauckies ask me, they go, “Neal…” “Neal, I’m a good Cauckie. What can I do?” “How can I combat white privilege?” Acknowledge it as it’s happening to you. This happened to me recently. I got pulled over doing 73 in a 35. So it was tight. [audience laughter] And white cop. I get my license and registration. He’s back running my plates, and I’m sitting there going, “I deserve whatever. A fine or a ticket.” “Whatever I’m going to get, I totally deserve.” He comes back. He’s like, “I’ll let you off with a warning.” I’m like, no, that’s fucked up. ‘Cause I know my Black or brown friends would at least be getting a ticket. I gotta say something. I was like, “Don’t be stupid. He’s a cop.” I was like, “No, now’s the time.” And I said, “Thanks, officer. It’s been a white privilege.” [audience laughter] He said, “The privilege is all white.” What the fuck? [audience laughter] Race is another one\\xa0of these issues that’s a weird one for me, ’cause it’s had an oddly big effect on my life. Not anywhere near a person of color, but 50 times the average Cauckie. Uh… [audience chuckles] And I’m good at writing racial jokes, and I’m like, is it my place to tell them? Like, if they fall into the wrong hands… Like, that “who needs rhythm when you own the record label” joke, that would crush at a Klan rally. Crush. [audience laughter] You can hear it. “So I said, ‘Who needs rhythm when you own the record label?'” “Good night. My name’s Jedediah.” [audience laughter] So it’s like, should I not tell the jokes in public? Like, I know what my intentions are, but, like, who gives a shit what my intentions are if they’re… misinterpreted? Pretty accessible comedy show, huh, folks? [audience laughter] I’m in a tiny theater, moralizing about race. Meanwhile, Kevin Hart’s in an arena, “I tell you about the time I went to Egypt and a camel bit me in the dick?” [audience laughter] Something… Something’s wrong with me. Oh, you know what? I think this is a woman’s shoe. You might be thinking like, “Neal, if you got married and had kids some of your… alienation might dissipate.” Maybe. I don’t know. Never been married. Don’t have kids. 48 years old. People don’t like it. [audience laughter] It’s worse for women if you’re over a certain age. Not married, no kids, people pity you. But as a guy, people are suspicious. [audience laughter] I would get more trust from women if I’d been married and murdered my wife. [audience laughter] They’d be like, “He’s capable of love. He gets too passionate.” [audience laughter] “Also, he’s not going to murder two people.” [audience laughter] Cute. Yeah, it’s not… I’ve… I’ve been in long-term relationships. Been in love a few times. It just never got to marriage. It just never got there. These are big risks, these relationships, ’cause… ’cause… You’re basically just doing a daily trust fall with somebody, right? Every day you’d be like, “Okay. Your turn. Okay, here we go.” Aah! “Oh my God, this is so fun. Do me.” “Okay, here we go. I got you.” Aah! “Oh my God, I feel so connected to you. We’re so lucky.” “Do me again.” Aah! [thud] I’ve hurt people as the catcher, and I’ve been hurt as the faller. They both suck for different reasons. The thing with these relationships is, you just have to believe in each other and assure one another, like, “We both feel the same way.” “I feel the same about you as you do me. We’re connected, we’re connected.” And then a certain point, they look at you and go, “Oh, I’ve been pretending.” “We’re… we’re… we’re not connected.” And then you have to parse the relationship to try to figure out when they started pretending. And then eventually accept the fact that some of the most cherished memories of your life may have been a grift. Shit’s breathtaking. I judge myself a lot for this. This is where I’m like, “Something really is wrong with you.” You know, other comedians judge me for it. I was talking to a comedian friend. He’s like, “You’d be more popular if you were married with kids.” I said, “Why?” And he’s like, “The audience trusts you more if you’re married with kids ’cause you’re moral.” “You put other people ahead of you.” Uh, which I’ve legally never done. I have a dog. You’re like, “Which one? The one you don’t love?” Fuck you guys. [audience laughter] I’m not telling you shit anymore. But I get how, as an audience member, you trust comedians more if they’re married with kids. I do have one follow-up question. How is Bill Cosby’s marriage? Any word? [audience cheering] Is Louis C.K. still happily married? He’s fucking hilarious. He must be married. I had one more, and I need you guys to give it to me straight. John Mulaney? [audience exclaiming] Don’t fucking “oh” me. I went to the goddamn wedding. [audience laughter] Yeah. I don’t know what you spent. I had to fly across country, rent a car. They’re like, “Wanna upgrade for $30?” I’m like, “It’s Mulaney’s wedding. Let’s blow it out.” Cut to me in a PT Cruiser going, “Was this an upgrade?” [audience laughter] Well, at least Woody Allen’s marriage is still flourishing, huh? [audience clapping] Did you see that documentary? Allen v. Farrow? Uh, they lay out the case pretty conclusively that before he married his stepdaughter Soon-Yi, he molested his other stepdaughter. And I got to say, it’s probably my least favorite Woody Allen movie. [audience laughter] My failure in relationships is not for lack of trying, I swear to God. Like, I’ve done different approaches, love language, attachment style. Age, race, weight, job. I dated a model. Thank you. [audience laughter] Guys, dating a model is like owning a dune buggy. Dating a model’s like owning a dune buggy ’cause at the beach, it’s great. But everywhere else, you’re like, “I shouldn’t have brought you here.” [audience laughter] [audience cheering] By the way, this is all going to be heterosexual. Like, I don’t have any gay insights. Never been gay. I check once a year. [audience laughter] I do. If you’re honest, check once a year. I go on Pornhub, I click the “gay” button, and I go, “Anything?” “All right, back to women.” [audience laughter] While I haven’t been gay, I have experienced a ton of homophobia ’cause I have a bidet. [audience laughter] My straight guy friends will be like, “Can’t do it, bro.” “Can’t have water shooting up my ass.” Are you worried about… Look, if the only thing keeping you from being gay is water hitting your ass… [audience laughter] …you are gay. [audience laughter] Just be gay. Come on over, take a ride on the pony, start your new life. That’s how rudimentary guys’ understanding of our sexuality is. We’re like, “I just got to protect the flag.” “And everything’s the same.” Fellas, no, you don’t. I’m 48. The flag’s been violated or whatever. I’ve had a couple fingers in the butt. From women. Nothing happened. Nothing changed. I wasn’t like, “My identity!” [audience laughter] “Everything I thought I was!” [audience laug\",\n",
       "  'hter] “Turn off Rogan, turn on Drag Race.” [audience laughter] You know what the first thing that always left in my relationships? Uh, appreciation for one another. Right? It happens in most relationships. We stop appreciating each other. Women start thinking, “Men are so thoughtless and stupid.” And men think, “Women are so fussy and high-maintenance.” And we’re both right. Women, you are fussy and high-maintenance. You know what else? They’re sophisticated and elegant, and can make emotional connections including, get this, direct eye contact. Women’s spirit is just elevating. They can transform a room with their presence and energy. I’m thankful there’s women here tonight. If there were no women here tonight, fellas, with just all dudes in a dark room staring at me… [audience laughter] …you know what the energy would be? Proud Boys, and you know it. [audience laughter] Just a bunch of guys in cut-off leather gloves and wearing their horrible sunglasses like this for some reason. [audience laughter] And women, you think men are thoughtless and stupid, and we are. But you know what else we are? Fucking hilarious. [audience laughing and applauding] We are. We’re very funny. Women are beautifully constructive, and men are hilariously destructive. Right? If you ever go to an all-women’s event, it’s just a bunch of women making eye contact and drinking white wine. [makes high-pitched sound] Eventually you’re like, “I gotta get the fuck out of here.” Right? But usually guys show up to kind of ground the energy, and we’re there, we’re trying to… We’re always trying to impress. We’re buying you shit, we’re break dancing… [audience laughter] …doing magic tricks, backflips. We’re telling stories with sound effects. “Then I punched him in the stomach.” Pssh! Then he took out a machine gun.” Trrrr! I’ve never heard a woman do a sound effect in my entire life. [audience applauds] Noises… Like birds’ chirps, meows, shit you could do. We’re always trying to make you laugh. We got funny mean nicknames for our friends. “This is Mike, aka Boner Mike.” [audience laughter] “Aka Illiterate Mike.” I never heard a woman be like, “This is Sarah, aka Barren Sarah.” [audience laughter] “She’s so dry down there, we call her Sahara.” [audience laughter] [audience laughing and whopping] [audience laughter] [sniffles] I just don’t have any like, real innate skill for being a boyfriend. Like, I’m thankful that there’s not an entrance exam to become a boyfriend ’cause I would fail that shit miserably. The woman would come with the results. “All right.” “We’re not going to pass you. I think you knew that.” [audience laughter] “Couple areas in which you didn’t do well, one of them was listening.” “Um, question was, ‘If you’re watching basketball on TV and your girlfriend needed to speak to you,\\xa0how would you handle it?’ We were looking for, ‘Turn the TV off, and ask what was going on, ‘ but you wrote down, ‘I’d turn the TV up.’ [audience laughter] ‘And say, “I can’t talk right now, babe. It’s the first quarter, which is one of the most important quarters.”‘ [audience laughter] “You also did poorly in conflict resolution.” “The question was, ‘If she had an issue with something you did, how would you deal with it?’ And you wrote down, ‘I’d think of a time she did something similar, and say, “See, bitch? Now we’re even.”‘ [audience laughter] Back to the apps for you, my friend. Yeah, something’s wrong with me, like… The other thing I’m not dying to get into with relationships is the power dynamic. ‘Cause I feel like men had all the power for 400,000 years, give or take. And about six years ago, women were like, “May we?” [audience laughter] I shouldn’t say men have no power. I should be more specific. Liberal white men have no power in relationships. At this period in history, as a liberal white man, you now have to go to protests against myself. Understand? [audience laughter] I… [applause] When the George Floyd protests broke out, I was like, “I’ll get my sign from the Women’s March. Here.” “I am the problem!” [audience laughter] I went to the Women’s March. It was inspiring on the one hand, and I also saw the funniest thing I’ve ever seen, right? So, inspiring, 400,000 women, their husbands, boyfriends, sons, dads, all together, marching for a cause. That was incredible. And then I also saw the funniest shit ever, uh… We all had signs that we made, right? And there was another guy there, and he had a sign that said, “This is what a feminist looks like,” with an arrow pointing at him. He and I are walking along, we make eye contact, the guy looks up at his sign and goes… [audience laughter] So we’ll see what happens. [audience chuckling] [man] Oh, my God. [chuckling] Yeah, I’ve dated a\\xa0lot of women that were correctors. I had two different girlfriends in my life say in front of me, “I trained him.” [audience muttering] “I taught him.” Yeah. Ever hear a guy say that? No, ’cause you don’t know any pimps. [audience laughter] [chuckling] Yeah. And you do teach us shit, women, but it’s never shit we want to know. Shit you want us to know. Never had a girlfriend be like, “Let me show you how to choke a wolf.” [audience laughter] It’s always girly shit that you want us to know, and then we go, [in squeaky voice] “Oh yeah.” [audience laughter] That’s the sound of a guy learning shit he does not care about in the slightest. “Oh yeah.” [audience laughter] “Duvet cover, yeah.” [audience laughter] “Yeah, a blanket should have its own pouch.” [audience laughter] “Thank you, babe.” Happens to all guys, all over the world. Age, race, class. Doesn’t matter. We all know what happened with Meghan Markle and Harry Potter. Right? Is that his name? [audience laughter] We know what happened. She came home and was like, “I know we’re in England, you’re a prince, but your family sucks, so let’s go to America and you’re a fucking nobody.” And he was like… “Oh yeah.” [audience laughter] “Fuck a thousand years of tradition. Thanks, babe.” So much in relationships is luck. That’s the thing nobody talks about. It’s luck. So this is the thing I looked up. So there’s a one-in-eight chance that you will marry somebody you’re dating. There’s a 50-50 chance the marriage will work. So, in essence, there is a 6% chance that you’ll be in an everlasting loving relationship with someone you’re dating, even if they’re great and you’re great. 6%. That’s luck. And I know I need to pause the show right now and let all the guys that are here on dates look at your lady and let her know that you guys are the exception. [audience laughter] [man] Whoo! You’re going all the way. I get it. But 6%. It’s luck, right? Even if I’m wrong it’s 9, but it’s 6. It’s luck. We’re all… We all judge each other for our failures at relationships. We judge ourselves. We should have empathy. We’re all basically just fans at an NBA game taking a half-court shot. When those fans miss the shot, everyone goes, “Aww!” They don’t go, “Fuck you!” [audience laughter] “Think about why you missed that shot.” “Start with your relationship with your mother and go forward from there.” [audience laughter] And then, babies. I’m not anti-baby. [audience chuckles] I’m anti-fetus. Y’all know I’m anti-fetus. [audience laughter] I fucking hate fetuses. I fucking hate them. I wish a fetus would step to me. [audience laughter] Yeah, so, I gotta… I’ve just never looked down and been like, “I should reproduce this.” “Run it back. Let’s go.” You know what TV show made me wary of having kids? You guys ever see that show, the nightly news? [audience laughter] Alright, climate change is a nightmare. We’re already double what Earth’s population should be. I can’t remember this much anger or division in my life. Having a kid right now would be like being at a house party, it’s packed with people, you can’t move, roof’s on fire, basement’s flooding, cops are coming, you look at your friend and you’re like, “We should invite Brian.” [audience laughter] The problem is I gotta tell women on first dates I won’t have babies. I guess I don’t have to. It just seems nicer, right? Because women have weird timing with that shit. I was on a date with a girl and she’s like, “I am 40.” “I need to start thinking about who I’m going to have kids with.” I was like, “Start thinking?” [audience laughter] “Miss, we may be down to minutes.” [audience laughter] Yeah, I got to tell women on first dates that I don’t want to have kids. People don’t like it. Telling a woman on a first date is like going to a job interview and being like, “Just so you know, I don’t fuck with computers.” [audience laughter] “How do you want to do this?” Maybe it’s luck. Maybe it’s timing. Or, you know, could be both. Or maybe it’s me. Maybe something’s wrong with me. Maybe I’m too cranky, or wounded, or misogynistic. Or something I don’t even know I am. You know what I realized? [woman] It’s not you. It’s not me? Well, good. Let’s end the show. Good night, everybody. [audience laughter] [chuckles] Women, do you see the kind of belief I’m looking for? Just a little? Yeah, like, I had the thought recently that I don’t think I can guarantee a woman’s emotional safety. And I’m not sure she could guarantee mine. I wish that were not the case, but that’s just how I feel. And people go, “Well, don’t you get lonely?” Yeah. But also, I’ve never been lonelier than in a relationship I didn’t want to be in. [audience applauds] And then with kids… You know, I say it’s climate change… It’s not. Secret, it’s not. [audience laughter] I say it’s all that stuff, but it’s about the emotional connection ’cause I don’t want the kid to come out, and I don’t feel it. We all know what happened with Keith. [audience laughter] And more importantly, my dad had ten kids, didn’t love any of us, rig',\n",
       "  'ht? So I don’t want to… I’m half him, so I could repeat that all over again. And people are like, “You’d be such a good dad.” I’d be a good Marine too. I don’t want to be a Marine. Like, people go, “Well, try.” It’s not… “Take the leap.” It’s not my risk, it’s their risk. They bear all the risk, right? ‘Cause if you’re born with a parent who doesn’t love you, you spend your whole life thinking something’s wrong with you. I… I also got to say, I really resent the pressure we’re all under to do it. I really resent it. Right? There’s dozens of new gender and sexual orientations. There’s still only one relationship orientation. Toward marriage. “What about polyamory?” There’s no tax cuts for polyamory. Stop it. But people are really impressed with like, “We got married and signed a license.” “A marriage license? How’d you do it?” [audience laughter] A legal yoke isn’t that impressive to me. You know what I mean? What’s more meaningful? A bird in a cage? Or a bird that flies away every day and comes back just ’cause they like being birds with you? Isn’t that better? [audience applauds] People say stuff like, “Well…” Just the dumb shit. “If you don’t marry her, you won’t be able to visit her in the hospital after hours.” [audience laughter] I will if I give security 40 bucks. [audience laughter] There you go, bird. Also, you ever ask married people how it is? [audience laughter] The answers may shock you. By the way, it’s not just men. Ask a woman how marriage is, women sound like a politician ducking a hot-button issue. “Lisa, how are things with you and Mike?” And she’s like, “Kids are great.” [audience laughter] And you ask guys how the marriage is, guys sound like they’re reading a hostage letter. “Mike, how are things with you and Lisa?” And he’s like, “Hello.” [audience laughter] “I am happy.” [audience laughter] “Do not worry about me.” [audience laughter] “Worry about yourself… [audience laughter] …and your heathen lifestyle.” [audience laughter] “She has taught me so much… [audience laughter] …and made me a better man.” And she’s in the corner like ISIS like, “Tell him about the duvet cover.” [audience laughing and applauding] “Oh yeah.” [audience laughter] This is fun. It’s just fun to be out, right? Do you know what one of the upsides of COVID might be, I hope, is uh, empathy for mental health stuff, right? ‘Cause everybody was isolated. And human beings don’t do well with isolation. We’ve still got cave brains. So we think if we’re isolated that the tribe is rejecting us, and then we start picking away at ourselves and finding faults that aren’t there and… Basically, our mental health declines. So I hope in the future that people have empathy when someone says, “I’m depressed or anxious,” they’ll go, “Yeah, I remember that.” Because for a lot of us, we’ve felt isolated our whole lives. And the other thing I’ll say, one of the things I didn’t mind about COVID was that we could all just chill a bit with work. We could put the sword down a little bit. If you achieved something during COVID, cool. If not, also cool. The only people who accomplished anything during COVID to me were Bo Burnham… [audience laughter] Amazon.com, and the 1998 Chicago Bulls. Somehow. [applause] They, like, won again, right? But it was nice to chill out, but as soon as the world opened up, I was back comparing myself to other comedians, and seeing who was doing whose podcast, and who did what venue, and how many tickets they sold. And am I too old to be on TikTok? Can a person do lip-sync videos and be on cholesterol medication? [audience laughter] Yeah, like I said, comedy is so public, and it can be sort of… you know, it’s exposing. And, like I said, there’s a lot of ways in which I feel like I don’t fit into the world, and I’m not doing it especially good, but comedy’s one of these things where I feel like I know what I’m doing, I’m part of something, but there’s always a reminder like, “You don’t.” Right before the start of COVID, Netflix had a party. By the way, this story’s so name-droppy, I apologize in advance. This story’s so name-droppy, DiCaprio was there, I don’t even mention it. [audience laughter] So, uh… Netflix has a party, and it’s at the head of Netflix’s house. A guy named Ted Sarandos. A great man. [audience laughter] [woman cheers] A great man. [audience laughter] So it’s at Ted Sarandos’ house, and I walk in, and it’s the biggest comedians in the world, right? I look over, it’s Burr, Aziz, Mulaney, Ali Wong, Sarah Silverman, Wanda Sykes, Trevor Noah, Borat. [audience laughter] And you’re like, “Pretty good. Pretty big, Neal. All right.” Dave Chappelle, Chris Rock, Kevin Hart. And then I look over here, Ellen DeGeneres, Eddie Murphy. I was like, “God damn. I’ve never seen all these people together, ever.” Right? And I remember thinking, “Buddy, I don’t know what you did to get invited to this party, but it must’ve been pretty good, and I’m proud of you.” And I’m just looking around at all these\\xa0heroes of mine, right? Uh, all icons. And Ted Sarandos, who is a great man… [audience laughter] …gives a toast, and he goes, “It’s such a thrill for me to be in the same room with all of my comedy heroes.” And Chris Rock yells out, “And Neal Brennan!” [audience laughter] I just thought, “Man, I hope someday Chris gets humiliated in front of all of his peers.” [audience laughing and applauding] And a great joke, by the way. Like, the right joke to make. I wish I could’ve been somebody else so I could have enjoyed it more. I was like, “Oh fuck, I am Neal Brennan. Shit.” [audience laughter] You know in a movie when someone gets embarrassed and they cut to slo-mo shots of… “Ha, ha, ha.” My slo-mo shots were Ellen going… [distorted] “Ha, ha, ha.” And Borat was like, “My wife!” [audience laughter] But, yeah, it just made me, like, second-guess myself, as usual. ‘Cause all these people are such naturals. Dave started doing comedy at 14. He was good then. Eddie knew he was going to be on TV when he was five. Ellen called being on\\xa0The Tonight Show before she did stand-up. Like, just all these stories, right? And meanwhile, I did it completely backwards. I was a writer, then I became a comedian in my thirties, and I had to… I’m not a natural. I had to grind and take vocal lessons and movement classes. I listened to multiple audiobooks about charisma. Multiple. [audience laughter] I act like this is all past tense. I’m doing it now. See this thing? “It’s not a watch.” You’re right. It’s not. It’s called a Pavlok. This thing gives me a small electric shock every three minutes on stage to remind me to smile more. It’s been happening the entire show. [audience laughter] [audience applauds] Yeah, when I’m around people like that, I’m like, “Am I not supposed to be doing this?” By the way, what even is this? Why can’t I just do regular stand-up? Last time I was like, “I’m going to need three different microphones set up equidistant.” This one is… And this one… “Ugh…” “Ha, ha, ha, ha.” [audience laughter] And then this show I’m like, “Hey, everybody, I brought blocks!” [audience laughter] I’ve spent the last… 15 years of my life being a comedian. And every comedian I met was like, “You seem like more of a writer.” Which is comedians’ way of saying, “Give me your jokes.” Before that I was a writer, and every writer was like, “You seem like more of a comedian.” Which is writers’ way of saying, “You’re annoying.” [audience laughter] If just feels like comedians over here, writers over here. Neal, you can just stay in this middle area, with your little stand-up traumedy shows. [audience laughter] Did I mention I paid her for this? Individually… these things are all manageable, you know? But it’s… In totality, that’s the hard part. That’s where the depression comes. And I’ve tried so much stuff. Like, so much. Therapy, medication. Ketamine. I tried transcranial magnetic stimulation. [click] Ooh, okay… [loud clicking] That was good, but it kind of wore off. So then I went to China to get a stronger version of TMS which isn’t legal in the States. [loud clicking] It may not even be legal in China, for all I know. And then, I did 5-MeO-DMT. Like Bufo alvarius. It’s like the nuclear bomb of psychedelics. I think I went too far… with that one. Like, I think… I think I hurt myself a little bit. Yeah, but I guess it makes sense if you’re looking for a magic bullet, occasionally you’re going to get shot. But I just kept thinking, “Dude, how did you turn self-help into self-harm?” I’ve been saying all night that something’s wrong with me. And something is wrong with me. [gentle music playing] I won’t show myself any kindness. I won’t give myself any grace. Like, I just grind and attack myself relentlessly like it’s my job. I would love to stop. I like to believe that my ways of being, like my thoughts, my habits, my emotions, my beliefs… I’d like to believe that they’re not defects. I’d like to believe that alchemy of a personality… my spirit… it’s got to be enough. Please. Let that be enough.

       " ['“Roseanne Barr: Cancel This!” is a stand-up comedy special showcasing Roseanne Barr’s return to the stage, amid a backdrop of rock music and an enthusiastic audience. Barr’s routine is unapologetically controversial and provocative, a mix of personal anecdotes, political commentary, and observational humor that reflects her brash and unfiltered comedic style. She opens with a light-hearted jab at her fake nails and a brief prayer for mental clarity before diving into her material. Roseanne reminisces about her career beginnings in Houston, expressing gratitude and joking about the audience’s privilege to witness her performance. She navigates through topics like moving to Texas, gun rights, and the political divide within her family, labeling her daughters as “libtards” for their differing views. Her act then takes a more personal turn as she discusses her controversial firing from her television show, attributing it to a racially charged tweet that she insists was a result of misunderstanding and medication. She uses this to segue into broader criticisms of political correctness, media, and the entertainment industry. Throughout the special, Barr doesn’t shy away from contentious subjects, including politics, gender, and her own mental health, often using self-deprecation as a tool for humor. She also touches on her life changes post-controversy, including her newfound residence in Texas, her experiences with COVID-19, and her views on the vaccination efforts. Roseanne continues to delve into various societal and personal topics, like the absurdity she sees in modern parenting, her disdain for certain celebrity behaviors, and her struggles with aging. Throughout the performance, Barr maintains a conversational and interactive rapport with the audience, responding to their reactions and occasionally engaging directly with individuals. Her act is punctuated by raucous laughter, cheers, and at times, boos, reflecting the divisive nature of her material. The special concludes with Roseanne encouraging her audience to be forthright with their feelings, delivering a final, defiant message of self-expression. Premiere date:\\xa0February 2nd, 2023, on Fox Nation. * * * [rock music] [audience cheers] Look at these fake nails. Woo-hoo, look at that! I’m about to go on. I’m praying to god that he lets my brains work for once, And he protects me from myself. Ha-ha, ha-ha. Crew: We’re on our mark and ready to go. Have a great show. Thank you very much. Crew: Good luck. Welcome back. Announcer: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage, Roseanne Barr. [intense music] [audience cheers] Hey! Thank you! Thank you very much. Hi! Thank you! [audience erupts in cheers] It’s so great to be here because I was thinking about it. You know, I kind of started my whole career here in Houston. Audience: We love you! I love you, too. What a privilege it is for you to have me here this evening, Ladies and gentlemen. [audience laughter and cheers] And, of course, I mean that from the bottom of my heart. I really do. Are you guys having fun or are you here with your families? [audience laughs] Mm. So let me take a quick rally of the troops here. Where are my peeps that are going to get really offended if I do not offend everybody? Where are my peeps here? [audience erupts in cheers] Oh, boy, good, there you are. There you are. Don’t worry. I’m going to get them all tonight. [audience applauds] That’s right. Well, guess what? I moved here to Texas, too. Isn’t that crazy? [audience cheers] I really did. My son– I don’t know, he’s somewhere– my oldest son, he’s somewhere here, and all my whole family’s here and the whole deal. Where is he? My oldest son, my youngest son, my grandson, my godson, my family’s here. None of my daughters are here because they– They don’t agree with me politically. They’re libtards, so they didn’t show up. But, uh– [audience cheers] But now I moved to Texas, and it’s Just beautiful because it’s a red state, and I love that. And, two, it’s just beautiful. I bought a beautiful ranch and what beautiful tundra We have here in Texas. Like, I look out my bedroom window. I can’t believe it. I see all these gorgeous little tiny baby deer in my yard, eating the grass around my pool. It’s so fantastic, you know, because I can pull out my AR-15 and blow them just to smithereens legally. [audience cheers] So fantastic! Open carry, bitches! Hell, yeah! [audience erupts in cheers] Ha-ha, hell, yeah. Anyways, anybody else been fired recently? [audience cheers] Audience: Woo! Ooh, well, we’ll talk about that a little. Ahem. For the people that have been fired, were you able to keep your insurance? Audience: No! Audience: No! Yeah, it’s kind of scary. I– I was able to keep my insurance. Thank god. But then I started getting real– real nervous because my family, my sons and stuff, they’re looking at me weird, like, that maybe I’m worth more dead than alive, you know. I don’t know. I get kind of paranoid about it because I watch the ID channel. And what with my big mouth and everything, well, anyway, my two sons and my grandson and my godson, they’re all here kind of to watch over me, to make sure me and my big mouth don’t squander no more of their inheritance, I guess is what they’re here for. [audience applauds] Man, I had a rough couple of years there. I got fired because basically I racially misgendered somebody I thought was a white woman. [audience laughs] Audience: Woo! Audience: Bullshit. Huh? Audience: I thought that bitch was white. I know, I thought the bitch was white. It’s true! [audience cheers] They wouldn’t– they wouldn’t let me explain. I don’t– here it was Memorial Day, you know. And I was at my mom’s house in Salt Lake City, Utah, And it was memorial day. And I should say, I barely could sleep anymore because the network was running me ragged, making me do promos, which I hate. You know what I mean? I’d rather die than do effing promos, not the ones that Fox is asking me to do. [audience laughs] I’m more than happy to do those. But I could never sleep because they had me Go to New York, LA, New York. That’s why I couldn’t sleep. I’m an old woman, 68. So they told me, oh, try some Ambien, you know, so I did. I got on the Ambien on top of all my psycho drugs Because I’m crazy. I’ll just be honest. I’m completely crazy. [audience erupts in cheers] Oh, thank you. You are, too, I see. Thank you. No, but I’ve been on psycho meds and bipolar meds And antipsychotic drugs my whole damn life, right? It was no big deal to me. I shouldn’t have mixed it with Ambien and then topped it off with three beers, though. I have to admit. I should not have did that. That caused me to lose everything. And so what happened, it’s about 1:00 am. And I don’t have such good eyesight. You may have read about that, and Somebody sent across a picture. And it’s about 1:00 am there, and so I Captioned it and passed out. And then I woke up– [audience laughs] At 7:00 am, and the whole goddamn world was on fire. [audience laughs] My boyfriend came in there. He goes, oh, my god, it’s on cnn that your tweet was racist. I’m, like, what are you talking about, “my tweet was racist.” Muslim ain’t a race. [audience laughs] He goes, no, they’re saying she’s– She’s African-American. I was, like, oh, shit. [audience laughs] Oh, shit, no. “yeah, and ABC is on the phone. They want to talk to you.” I’m, like, oh, shit, I don’t want To talk to no Hillary donors. [audience laughs] After all I’ve been through on that show, you know, So I get on there. And the guy, you know, you can imagine. Oh, here’s how the phone call starts. (over-enunciating) “what possible– Excuse– Can you have– For the egregious– Thing you have done?” You know, and then just god and my upbringing comes in my head. And it’s, like, just tell the truth, Roseanne. You’ve always got to tell the truth, right? Tell the truth. The truth will set you free. You know what I’m talking about, ma’am? So I’m, like, you’re right, father. I’m just going to tell the truth. “I thought she’s white.” [audience laughs] It’s like total silence. [audience laughs] So I start tap dancing, you know as you do When you know you’re in shit. [audience laughs] I’m, like, hey, don’t do nothing to my show, ok? Don’t– don’t cancel me or do nothing to my show, fire me, nothing like that. I’ll tell you what. Just put me on “The Jimmy Kimmel Show” And on “The View” and a lot of your other shows You’ve got on the ABC channel, you know, where people, they’ve been in blackface and everything. I’ll go on there, and surely they’ll understand my mistake. [audience moans and cheers] Because surely they didn’t get fired for that shit. And they’ll understand when people Do something really stupid. And, uh, so, no, they said, “Well, Roseanne, we’ll have To see how the community”– That’s what he said– “we’ll have to see How the community reacts.” [audience boos] Yeah, and in my mind, I was thinking, what community. [audience laughs] The, uh, baby blood-drinking democrat community or, uh– [audience erupts in cheers] Or the protect Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey, and Prince Andrew community? Which community exactly are you talking about? [audience cheers] But I didn’t say it because, at that time, I was thinking it was more important to be nice. [audience laughs] So I walk in, and it’s on CNN that they’ve canceled my show just 20 minutes later. And not only that, but they killed my– they killed, uh, Roseanne. They killed her. [audience boos] Yeah. Yeah, I guess they thought they shut me up. But guess what? Ha-ha, ha-ha, ha, anyway– [audience erupts in cheers] Yeah, I didn’t really care at that time because I couldn’t sit in them writing rooms with those people one more second. I wasn’t re',\n",
       "  'ally that pissed what they did to me. But, you know, I was really mad what they did to my fans because they disrespected their own viewers, you know. [audience cheers] Like, we could have– we could have had her come on my show, and she could have read me the who’s it. And she could have dressed me down. We could have had a teachable moment that they’re all talking about. She could have come on. I could have had 15 times the ratings, And I could have learned something on behalf and shown something to America, which I always wanted to do that very thing anyway, bringing people together and learn about each other, right? When we have made mistakes for– Because we can learn. We can learn to get along for gods sake. [audience applauds] But, no, they didn’t want to do that, and that pissed me off. And that’s why I came back, even though I was, like, why would you want to do that after what they did. But I came back because I just– something’s wrong with me or something. I just– something’s in me. I just cannot let assholes win. I’m not. I’m not going to. [audience erupts in cheers] I’m not going to. [audience cheers] I am not going to let rich, privileged assholes win. I’m not! [audience erupts in cheers] And, you know, looking back, I believe that I actually Got fired because I delivered an audience– An unbelievable audience of 28 million people to a show that had a trump hater and a Hillary hater still loving each other, still living under the same roof as a family, still being American. And, by god, they hated that! [audience cheers] But whatever, it’s all in the past now. It was a weird– It’s been, like, five years or something. It was a weird five years. We’ve all been through some shit in the last five years, right, the whole country. We’ve all been through some shit in the last five years. Well, imagine my surprise when my agent called and said Fox Nation was offering me a big contract to do a stand-up special. Imagine my shock. [audience erupts in cheers] I was shocked. I was happy but shocked. They sent along a contract and said, hey, we want you to do an hour or so of material but no racism, sexism, transphobia, homophobia, anti-semitism. I go, well, there goes my whole fucking act. What– what? [audience applauds] And they said and we want you to do very few swear words as well. [audience laughs] But that– that– the f-word I just used, ladies and gentlemen, is one of three times tonight I will be using the f-word because my lawyers were able to go in and wrangle a three f-word deal out of the Fox Nation’s lawyers. [audience laughs] And I accepted because it’s kind of a challenge for me. I’ve never done an hour of comedy before with only using the f-word three times. I thought, hey, this is a chance to try something new. [audience laughs] Never done it before so. Audience: We love you! I love you. You’re sweet. [audience cheers] Thank you so much for coming to see me tonight. Any Jews here tonight? [audience cheers] Wow, a lot of Jews, that’s pretty amazing. Hi. Hi, Jewish people. There’s probably a lot more Jews, But they’re kind of ashamed to raise their hand. [audience laughs] Yeah, I don’t blame you. I’m lucky. Nobody ever thinks I’m Jewish because I’m from Utah. Audience: No more bitches with stitches. We all get to open our mouths. Huh? Audience: No more bitches with stitches. We get to open our mouths. That’s right. We do but shut up, bitch. But, anyway– [audience erupts in cheers] I mean– I mean– I mean, right on, sisterhood. But, anyway, no, but, no, it’s kind of embarrassing to be a jew. And I would like to take this opportunity to kind of apologize to the gentile nations for the Jewish people. Like, you know, like, Epstein, Weinstein, and all these here. Sorry. I am a jew, and people don’t think I’m Jewish because I’m not from the East Coast or nothing. I’m from Salt Lake City, Utah. Audience: Woo! Any Mormons here? Audience: Yes! Hi, Mormons. Love ya. I grew up with Mormons. That was a weird place to be Jewish, though, Salt Lake City, Utah. Boy, my family, we stuck out like a sore thumb there in Mormon Utah, you know, because we only had the one mother, and so that was weird. [audience laughs] She had to do all the mothering by herself. That was kind of rough on her. And my mother was the most beautiful Jewish woman In the Jewish community. That’s what everybody said all the time. They were, like, she looked like Elizabeth Taylor. That’s what everybody said, and she had a gorgeous figure, you know, my mother. And she managed to snare the one Jewish football hero at West Side High School, which was my daddy. He was a football hero there. He played center at West Side High, and he was a big old football hero. And they called him Jerry Barr, the boy built like a barrel. [audience laughs] So they were quite a couple. And they had me and guess whose body I inherited. [audience laughs] Not my mother’s but my dad, the body built like a barrel, With no waist and no ass cheeks whatsoever. It’s very sad, very sad for a girl. I had no ass whatsoever. I’m telling you the truth. Just a crack in my back is basically what I had. It’s very sad for my– nobody wanted to date me. Plus, my mother and father were very concerned that I would never find a husband because I was fat and had a bad attitude and a big mouth. I mean, they were really– [audience laughs] They were really overly concerned about that I’d never get a husband. That was my whole life. You’re never going to get a husband Unless you go on a diet. I mean, no guy is ever going to want to marry you, What, with you having no tuchus– That’s what they’d say– no hips, no buttocks, no waist, and a big mouth. And you’re always in trouble, and you’re really fat, You know, and nobody likes that kind of thing, you see. So you’ve got to go on this. They put me on so many diets, the rice Diet, the birdseed diet. They put me on every damn diet, and none of them worked. Finally, my mom said she’s going to– she finally got a guy for me to date, and I was suspicious Right away. She’s, like, I found a wonderful gentleman– She called him– in the Jewish community That I think you’ll be– You’ll be happy to know is interested in dating you. So right away, I’m suspicious, right? So she goes, so I don’t know if this rings true for any of you. Probably not because it’s a whole different culture, I know. But the first thing that went in my mind is– I don’t know if this happened to you, if this is familiar– is, like, “um, mom, we’re not related to him, are we?” [audience laughs] Does that ring true for any of y’all? Audience: Yeah. And by the way, she answered– because it took Her a long time to answer– I knew that we were related, you know. And it was Stu Bernstein, that big fat guy, that big fat slob Of the Bernstein family. And all of them had eyes that went like this, Wah-wah, wah-wah, wah-wah. The whole family’s eyes, wah-wah, wah-wah, they never Stood still, none of their eyes, you know. And they were fat, not that I should say Nothing about fat but the eyes. And, plus, he’s a chronic masturbator, Which I guess he thought– He thought we didn’t see it or nothing. The guy, he thought he was disguising it, but I knew what he’s up to, you know. He’d go like this. “well, let’s all go down to the Dairy Queen there and get ourself an ice cream.” [audience laughs] “what do you say?” Sitting there on the couch or standing up, whatever, It’s always, like, “well, let’s go over to Safeway There and pick ourself up”– I knew what he was doing. So I’m, like, no, I’m not. I’m not, you know. [audience laughs] So she said, “Well, you’ve got to go on a diet Then if you want to.” So she took me to this diet guy. This is, I swear to god, true on my kids’ lives. I’m 16, and I’m fat. So we’re out there. We’re waiting in the waiting room. And she waits till the last minute, my mom, to tell me, “Oh, Roseanne, by the way, the doctor is blind”– [audience laughs] –“and how he tells how much weight you need to lose is by feeling your body.” [audience laughs] I swear to god. So I’m in shock. So we go in there, and he rolls over In a wheelchair because not only is he blind But he can’t walk neither. He’s a mess, nothing but mess. And he rolls over there and starts going like this. “mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, oh, mm-hmm.” And he does my boobs, too. “mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. I’d say there’s about 40 pounds of you That you need to release.” “Thanks, doctor.” So he fixes it up that I go in there every day– I swear to god this is true– and I get a shot of urine from a pregnant horse. Have any of y’all heard of that? Urine from a pregnant horse, well, it makes your what’s-it speed up. What’s that, son? Audience: Metabolism. Your metabolism speed up, so you start losing weight, and I did. I lost a ton of weight. I lost so much weight that I got pregnant by the neighbor guy, so that was good. [audience cheers] Anyway, that’s another sad story. But, yeah, I was kind of cute at that time, then I left home. I had all these fantasies living at home there, living at home Where I was just, you know, my mom’s Ugly daughter that stood in the corner chewing on my hair. But, uh, I don’t know what I’m talking about. Oh, yeah, so I was kind of a loner. I had all these fantasies. I didn’t have no friends or nothing, mostly in my room, living in my imagination. Number one, I wanted to grow up, leave Utah, of course. Two, I wanted to get out there and get my pork on because we were not allowed to have any pork in my house. I wanted to move away, so I could take birth control pills so that I would be able to have indiscriminate sex With everyone– every guy I ever met– and to get my own show, named “The Roseanne Show.” And I’m so proud to say that I was ',\n",
       "  'able to make all of those dreams come true, ladies and gentlemen. [audience erupts in cheers] Thank you for the validation. [audience cheers] But, anyway, due to the spam and my love of spam, which has never subsided, I think that’s a large reason for why I moved to Hawaii, which I still live in Hawaii. Now I’m, like, half Hawaii, half Texas, which is cool. [audience cheers] I love Hawaii. It’s a fantastic place. But one thing we say over there, it is quite a short trip from Aloha to a-hole. It’s quite a short trip sometimes over there. And, yeah, yeah, spam, that evens it all out. You probably read about me having macular degeneration and losing my eyesight and all that, right? So the fact of it is I could grow weed over there in Hawaii, And that really helps me with my eyesight things, right? [audience cheers] It is such a good medication, and that’s another thing. When I ran for president, I ran on legalization of marijuana Because it’s a good, good drug. [audience erupts in cheers] Right? It really helps you if you have anxiety issues, which I do, Because I get very anxious when I think I might run out of pot. So it’s a very good treatment for that kind of thing. And you know what? The marijuana, it does help me with my driving Since I can’t see too good. And, well, I probably shouldn’t even drive is the bottom line There since I can’t see. And, yes, it’s true. I have hit a few people. But, you know, luckily, I was not hurt, so it all worked out. But– but one day, my kids were coming over, And I haven’t really talked about my kids too much. I have five of them. And, you know, my kids are probably like your kids. They’re ungrateful, privileged, little fucking bastards That have never had to work a day in their life for anything. [audience cheers] You know, and they’re too good for cheese. My kids are too damn good for regular cheese. So I was going over there to the health food store to get them this soy cheese because they’re too good for real cheese, you see. So, anyway, I move on. I go over there, and I pull in. And some lady is sitting in her car, looking over at me. And I had a couple of shots before I came to the store, you know, to help me with my focus and this and that. And she looks over, and I’m, like, ah, god, I’m going to have to act like I’m nice because she probably recognized me or some shit. So now I’m acting like I’m nice, which I do all the time. It’s the least I can do. [chuckles] [audience laughs] [audience cheers] So she looks over at me, and she’s, like, you– you hit me. You hit me with your car, your fender. I’m, like, I didn’t hit you, bitch. What are you talking about? This is a Tesla. If I was going to hit you, it would have made some kind of a beeping noise, you know, that Tesla is prepared for hitting things, and it warns you. I didn’t hit you, you crazy bitch. And I said, you know what you’re doing? You just know I’m in show business, so you smell some money. That’s what you’re doing, right? Do you see where I’m going with this? A lot of people are like that. I go, you smell money because I’m in show business. You thought you can start some shit with me, and I have to give you a settlement. And that’s what you’re doing. You’re not the first, and you’re probably not going to be the last. She goes, “That is not true, Roseanne. I’ll have you know”– [audience cheers] She goes, “I will have you know that I am also in show business, ok? The last 24 years, I was Bette Midler’s dresser. I’ll have you know that.” [audience laughs] I’m, like, “Yeah, well, blowing cocaine up Bette Midler’s asshole is not show business, is it?” [audience cheers] Then she moves in for the kill. “I think you’re driving around drunk, Roseanne.” I said, “I’ll have you know, I am an actress, and I know how to maintain. You are an anti-semite. That’s what’s wrong with you,” because that’s what we Jews do when we’re losing an argument, right? “you are an anti-semite.” [audience cheers] She goes, “My name is Goldberg.” I’m, like, “Well, then I’m an anti-semite.” [audience applauds] And I sped away in my Tesla home. When I went in, I noticed the front fender was all smashed in. [audience laughs] Ooh, uh-oh. Can you believe that it has been two or three years since we was all in the quarantine? Can you believe back that far? I’m glad you’re out. I’m glad we can come out. [audience cheers] What about all that quarantine? Remember all that? You know, I figured out q, q, it stands for quarantine. It wasn’t any of that who’s going to get arrested bullshit. It stands for quarantine. Q, the great awakening, you know why? Because you had to be with your goddamn family in the house, and you couldn’t get out of there. You couldn’t go to the gym. You couldn’t go to a restaurant. You couldn’t get away. You couldn’t go to nobody else’s house. You were stuck there in the shit with your friggin’ family and couldn’t get away. That’s why they say the great awakening. You had to deal with that shit, and you couldn’t run anymore. [audience laughs] Dang. I was smoking a lot of cigarettes at the beginning of the quarantine there. After getting fired, I started smoking again, And I love to smoke. But my kids ganged up on me. They’re, like, “You better quit smoking, mom, because you’re going to get COVID. And then you’re going to have to go to the hospital, and they’ll put them things down your throat and kill you, like they do in New York. You better quit smoking.” So I did quit smoking. And you know what happened soon as I quit smoking? Soon as I quit, I got the COVID the minute I quit smoking. And then I read that cigarette smoking actually protects you from getting the COVID. That’s when I knew everything was bullshit. [audience cheers] It’s all bullshit and nothing but lies, every single damn thing. [audience cheers] I’ve had the COVID four times now, and I lost all my taste. I have no taste and no smell either all this time. But I look at it like it’s a silver lining in the COVID cloud because I don’t eat so much. I’m not wanting to eat everything, And it don’t taste that good so I lost some weight. Thanks, lord. [audience laughs] Once I got the COVID, though, and saw that my kids weren’t going to come over, I was, like, man, I’m going to get the long COVID. [audience laughs] I’m going to get that COVID that never quits. Woo, it’s wonderful. It’s like living in a rest home is what it was like there. I had an assistant that cooked for me and brought me tea, And none of my family ever came over. Oh, my god, it was so great. It was the first time in my life that I haven’t had to take care of nobody’s kids or do their goddamn laundry Or get out of bed and do shopping for or any of that shit. I just laid there in bed talking to god and writing jokes. It was fantastic. [audience erupts in cheers] I did not want my grandkids coming over, ’cause they’re always sick. And they make me sick all the time. My daughter thinks it’s good that they’re sick. Your mom thinks it’s good that the kids are sick. It would always drive me nuts. She goes, it’s good they’re sick because they’re developing Their anti– What do you call it? [audience shouting] Yeah, their immunity. They’re getting their immunities. It’s good that they’re sick. Yeah, well, I’m 70. What about my immunities, bitch? You bring over these kids with the green snot in their nose, And it takes me a month to get over it. Stay home. I’ll watch them on Facetime. Right? It was so much better. It was just great. How many yous got the vax? [laughs] [clapping] A few of yous. You probably had to get it, right? Were you forced to get the vax? Yeah. Boy, what a– that makes me mad, they Forced people to get the vax. I hope they have to pay for that, what they did to us. Woman: Yeah! Did you get any of that myocarditis, Or the facial paralysis, or, you know, The adult dropping dead syndrome or any of that shit? Get any of that? What happened to people that they start believing, For some reason, that this government had their best interest at heart? Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha! What? What? My whole family’s bunch of libtards, you know, as I said. And they called me a conspiracy theorist the whole time, But everything I said turned out to be true. Did they apologize? Hell no! They never apologize. Never admit they’re wrong, do they? Now, my whole family is sick, what with blood clots and this And that and the other. They’re all sick. I’m the only healthy one. I’m gonna miss ’em! [audience laughter] What happened to people, though? How could they line up to take these shots From this government, knowing that this government gave Smallpox-infested blankets to the first nations people, Gave syphilis to black prisoners in Tuskegee, Told us there was weapons of mass destruction Before they leveled Iraq and destroyed Libya, told us fen-phen was safe and then all The fucking fat people died? What happened? And they’re like, hey, can I get that booster? Can I get that shot in those 15 boosters? Would you mind giving my daughter here That shot right in her eyeball after she’s born? Could you give her 10 of those right in the eyeball? Could you give her a shot right in her little baby clitoris? Could you do that for me, Mr. Biden? What’s wrong with people? What’s wrong with them? These young pink pussy hat wearers, They want to be lied to. They want to be lied to because they are so used to it. You can’t wake them up, because you can’t wake up people that Are pretending to be asleep. That’s what I figure. Nobody– [audience cheers and applauds] Nobody in their lives has ever cared enough to tell them The damn truth. It’s our fault, us baby boomers. We ruin their lives. We lied to them all away. We lie to women, ruin their lives. For example, my',\n",
       "  ' son, he’s 27 years old. I’m very proud of him. He’s the only one of my children who ever went to college And graduated. I couldn’t be more proud. [audience cheers] But what does he do with it? Just sits there in my office, took over my office. I can’t even walk in my office, what With the empty beer cans and the dirty socks. And all he does is sit there playing video games all night long every night. “Call of Duty.” What’s that other one? Audience: “Fortnite.” “Fortnite,” “Call of Duty.” And what’s that other one? [audience shouting] “Grand Theft Auto.” That’s his whole life, for god’s sake, Sitting there, asking me stupid questions I have no idea how to answer. Who’s my real father? What am I supposed to say about things like that? I mean, these people, they have no concept of reality. They’ve been living in a bubble forever, Asking questions that have nothing To do with the real world. What is my gender? Mom, what is my gender? Your gender is, get a job. That’s your gender. What are they thinking? Ask, what is a woman? They don’t know that? But when they’re asking all the time, what is a woman? I’ll tell you what a woman is, a woman is me! [audience cheers] That’s what a woman is, ok? A woman is someone who cleans up everybody else’s shit! That’s what a woman is. A woman is somebody whose boobs hang down to her knees With a prolapsed uterus from giving birth to five Ungrateful little privileged bastards that Have never had to work for anything In their whole damn lives! [audience cheers] [laughs] My pronouns are kiss my ass! [audience cheers] And I just want to say to all those girls That are all so damn upset about them Overturning the “Roe v Wade” thing, don’t get so damn upset about it! You are never gonna get pregnant. You’ve got the vax! You’re never gonna have a baby. Chill out! Yeah. I do have a message for today’s women. I’m trying to get a Kleenex out of this pocket. There it is. I do have a message for today’s women. I think it’s important. Women, keep your penis in your pants. There’s no excuse for this kind of behavior. In this day and age, take some responsibility For your own actions, women. These #metoo whores, they are so on my last nerve. You know what I mean? If you are gonna go to a Disney producer’s room at 3:00 am, Are you kidding me? Then you’re not gonna turn around and cry about it And try to get some money out of it. You’re not. The world has changed a lot since I was alive. I’m telling you, it’s changed so much. When I was young, we gals used to go to parties hoping to get Drunk so we’d wake up pulling a train of five guys just For fun. And nobody thought anything about it. It was no big deal. You know what I mean? Remember when you were young and you got molested? It is your fault. Remember that? Remember? My mom’s like, didn’t I tell you not to go around old Joe when he comes to the corner on his bike? I told you to stay away from him. You know what he does to the young girls. And there you are, running up there to the corner, Knowing what he is going to do to you, And then you complain about it. He buys us ice cream! We didn’t do yoga stretches. Do you know what I mean? We didn’t drink caramel pumpkin latte “mah-chi-ah-to,” White woman caramel drinks. We didn’t do that. We drank tab and fresca and shit that had saccharin in it. They gave us liver cancer, and we were happy to have it, ’cause we were tough, unlike you people, you young people. Privileged. Just privileged. That’s what I realized in quarantine. Privilege really kills. Privilege is what ruins lives, when You start thinking, you know, that the world Needs to be pretty for you. Well, it don’t. Right? Just because you got a degree in gender studies, That don’t mean shit. You’re not gonna get a job no place. You can’t even get a job at Whole Ho Ho’s donuts. Didn’t I tell you that? I told you. Privilege kills and bliss is ignorance. I turn those around. Bliss is ignorance, right? I have three different litters of children. Oh, I say that. I had three different litters with three different men Because I’m a whore. You know what I mean, ladies. And parenting has changed so much, too, since, you know, back in my day. It’s changed so much. Who else has teenagers in their 50s? Yeah, I have three daughters. I told you they’re very liberal, but they’re In their late 40s and 50. Three daughters in menopause. That’s when you know you’re old. For god’s sake, that’s when you know you’re old, right? I can’t believe how fast it went, too. Oh, my god. They tell me, you know, the things they come up with now. They’re like, mom, the doctor, they want us to take Testosterone for our symptoms. They are trying to give everybody crazy ass hormones From the time they’re two all the way up, Giving women testosterone to treat Their perimenopause is insane. I’m like, great. Now you’ll be lifting weights and watching football. I wouldn’t take it if I was you. That’s just asking for trouble, you know, Because your IQ is gonna decrease by half. And then you’re gonna just start peeing on toilet seats For no good reason whatsoever. It’s just, I don’t think it’s– I don’t think it’s good. But I kind of think maybe I shouldn’t have left the democrat party so early, what with their full-term abortion stuff they’re doing these days. Because I’m thinking, hey, another couple of months, They’re probably gonna move right into, I’d be able to abort these bitches by the time they’re 50. I bet they’re gonna move right into it. You know, I mean, it’s coming. That’d be cool. So things aren’t what they seem. Like, my brother and my sister are both gay. I’ve mentioned that before. And both of them are married to their gay partners That they’ve both been with for 34 and 35 years, which is Pretty amazing, considering– [audience cheers] Yeah. It’s great. They’ve raised children. And you know, I’m heterosexual and I’ve been married 9 or 10 Times, so you can’t ever be– You know, go with the stereotype for things. But they’re progressive parents, though, And I can’t stand that, progressive parents. I can’t stand it. It don’t make any sense, you know, the way they just let Their kids get away with shit. They just, like a rubber band, stretch it to the end. You know? My sister, she never quite puts the hammer down on her. She has twin lesbian daughters that are– That’s what I call them. They’re not really lesbians. But they’re, like, 21. She never really put the hammer down. They could get away with anything, you know? Not like my kids. I really– you know, I’m there, on top of my kids. My kids can’t get away with anything that I know about. But yeah. She’s like, I’m going to count to five, Like that some big threat. You know? Woman: Yeah. [laughs] You know, I mean, that progressive. 1, 2, 3? I’m like, you’ve got to hit these bitches! If you want them to do right, you’ve got to hit ’em. You’ve got to hit your kids. I have to say that. We need to hit ’em more. And why has it fallen to me to be The person to have to hit everybody’s Kids in the grocery store? Why has that fallen to me? But there they are in the grocery store. Their mom will pay no attention to them because she’s too busy photographing her ass– [audience laughter] –For her Instagram page, where the kids are running wild. It just really gets me. It’s like, why did you have them? Now I’m, like, kind of on a bender about it. So of course, I’m gonna hit ’em. You know, I’m gonna have to. Somebody has to. What are you gonna do, go over there? Hey, stop doing that. That ain’t right. Didn’t your mother tell you that? Keep your hands off stuff, and don’t stick your nasty fingers Through the plastic. Do you understand me? And I’m like, ma’am? Ma’am? Did it ever occur to you when you had these little bastards That you were gonna bring them to a public place Where other people would have to care for them while you Took pictures of your ass? It just gets me. It really gets me, as I’m jealous of anyone who Has an ass, well, first of all, because I Was born ass-less in an ass-based economy And I’m bitter about it. I never thought I would see the day when a woman goes into her husband and says, Honey, do these pants make my ass look fat enough? There’s no men left in our country. Have you noticed that? All the men, they want to be women, Or else they’re just complete pussies and losers. Have you noticed that? There’s no men with any kind of spine left. They’ve all been beaten down. What happened to the men? Are there any men here tonight who would define their self? [audience cheers] Oh, sure. Really? Ok. Well, let’s take this little test. You think you’re a man, huh? You think you’re strong, yeah? Mr. Man, well, let’s see. I defy any of you men who say you’re strong and manly And this and that. Well, I defy you to go home tonight and tell Your wife or girlfriend that she needs To sit down and shut her yap. Tell her you need to sit down and shut Up and get off every other woman in the world’s case. Stop bitching about every other woman And trying to stir up shit for them. Close your mouth and make me a sandwich. Things would be a lot better. Am I right? And I bet none of yous will do it, either. None of yous will do it because you’re scared shitless. I know it. Women are– I don’t know. Something has happened to women, and they’re just All completely brainwashed. We’ll do anything for dick, anything for dick. What happened? We used to like freedom and liberty and this and that And being independent. Now, it’s anything for dick, putting plastic in your boobs, In your butt, in your calves, your eyes, your cheeks, Just to get some guy to get, what, an erection around you, For god’s sake? Dancing around erect phalluses? That’s your whole world, for god’s sake, now? You’re dick-mo',\n",
       "  '-tized. You’re dick-tarted, for Christ’s sake? What is that about? You’re on hormones. Wake up. They’ve got all the women on the hormones because– This is what they told me. Roseanne, unfortunately, the only thing thin on you Is your vaginal walls, and so you need to get on hormones so That they’ll plump up and you’ll be able to enjoy Sex with your boyfriend. What? Those days are over! It– it’s just over. You shouldn’t even– right? You people don’t agree with me. Who’s older than me? Who’s older than 70? Kathy: Yeah! How old are you? Kathy: 71. 71. What’s your name? Kathy: Kathy. Kathy? So you’re a big sex fiend. You’re 71 and you’re a big sex fiend? Is that what you’re saying? Kathy: Not at all! Oh, you are– You identify with me, that we ought to be over all this? Is that what you’re saying? Absolutely! I love you, girl! You got a working brain there. Good. I’m glad. Now, how many of you women are trying to plump up Your vaginal wall so you can have sex with a guy You have lived with for 15 years and are sick of? I’d like to know that. [audience laughs] Woman: Yes, that’s for certain! Woman: Whoo! Woman: Shit. Well, anyway, I’m old, like I said. And I was thinking about, a lot of people have a bucket list. You know? I don’t really want to bungee jump off the Eiffel Tower or any of that shit. I got a fuck it list. Yeah, stuff I want to stop doing before I Kick the breathing habit. It’s way easier, you know, to stop doing. Like, one thing I’m gonna do is, I’m going to stop pretending To be interested when old people pull out Pictures of their grandkids. You know? Like, put that shit away. That kid looks like an albino monkey in braces. Put that shit away. I’m never going to nobody’s wedding if they’ve been married more than three times. It’s like, let me know if you’re still together After seven or so years, and I’ll send you A toaster or something, whore. I’m not gonna listen when old people start griping About their medical issues. That really bum– god, that makes me mad. Well, Roseanne, you know, I’ve got the sciatica and the fibromyalgia Going this way and that, meeting up here at the waist, going down my leg here. And it’s really painful, and I can barely– Oh, I had to go to the doctor the other day Because I could barely bend over and move there, is all. Hey, why don’t you do me a favor and just die, already? Ok? ’cause I’m their friend, I’ll put in an appearance at your funeral, But I just don’t have time for this shit now. Another thing, I’m not gonna be nice to those Jehovah’s Wit-less people that come over there, knocking on my door, Asking me where I plan on spending eternity. I’m gonna say, come on in! Come on. But you got to take your pants off ’cause it’s satan’s birthday! And last but not least, I’m never going on another date with Bill Cosby. You can believe me. Never. My back hurt after that. Well, another thing in the quarantine, Is that I was getting in touch with my psychic abilities While I was there, all by myself there. And so I know there’s probably some yous here that wants me to do a psychic reading for you While we’re all here together. Woman: Yeah! If you’ve got a question about your future– And it needs to be a real question, You know, thought out. I’ll give you a minute. A real question regarding your future. You might be very, very surprised at how accurate I am And how psychic, how very, very psychic I am. Ok. Is there anybody who wants me to answer their psychic– Man: Me! Yes, over here, sir. Uh-huh. Oh. No, you’re still gonna have to fuck her. I’m sorry to say it. Sorry. I’m sorry to say that. Why, I said it already five times, didn’t I? I failed. Sorry, sir. You’re still gonna have to have sex with her, So you won’t be getting lucky. Yes, ma’am? Will you get married? Do you have somebody you’re engaged to? And do you know anybody you want to marry? You haven’t met nobody to marry yet? Carolyn: I’ve been married once. You’ve been married once but you don’t know nobody.

Like, right now, I have a very good suggestion for all My fans and all y’all here. I love you so much. Now, a lot of us are on antidepressants. And we’re very depressed and this and that Over the quarantine and the fact of what they’ve done to us, What we’ve just lived through. But I found a way, drug-free, alcohol-free, To be able to lift my own spirits, And I want to pass it on to you. And it really, really works, too. Now, what it is– What I do is, I write suicide notes to everyone in my family, Blaming them for my death. And it really helps. I mean, it really lifts me up in my spirits. You know, it really, really does. It’s so wonderful. “dear mom, remember those party dresses you sewed for me And forced me to wear to third grade Because you said they were slender-izing, The ones with the hoop skirts that I couldn’t lift up fast Enough or push out of the way on the potty, Causing me to pee on the back of them And then to be laughed at by all the other students The entire day? Well, now it seems that I’ve killed myself, And I just want you to know that you’re to blame. [audience laughs] Had you been a better mother or seamstress, I might be taking those western swing dancing classes with you and your new boyfriend, Arnie, right now. But instead, I’m stepping cold and hanging in the closet Like that goddamn dress. Thanks, mom!” [applause] It’s just– it’s just amazing how it’s lifting. “dear daughter, when you called me a racist simply Because I told you that your boyfriend was An unemployed, crack-smoking Mexican fellow, that in no way meant that I don’t love the Mexican people themselves, As I do. As I pointed out to you, you could have picked A Mexican gentleman who didn’t smoke crack, had a job, and no facial tattoos, and I would have celebrated with you. But now, I’m rolled up in the dirt like a burrito, And it’s your fault I’m dead. Hasta la vista, baby.” And something that really, really pisses me off here. “dear McDonald’s, your refusal to offer the McRib sandwich Year-round–” Because you never know when it’s gonna come back, do you? You think they could afford some kind of advertising plan Where they’d say, the McRib that comes on July 4th. July is the time for the McRib. Or they could go, Christmas is for the McRib or just anything. But no, they never tell us when it’s gonna come back, do they? So we can’t plan our lives or anything. “dear McDonald’s, refusal to offer the McRib sandwich Year-round has left me with no other choice Than to wash down a fistful of Vicodin with a jumbo bottle of vodka from Costco. Because you, sirs, have barbecue sauce as well as my blood On your hands. And I’m loving it!” [audience laughs] [applause] And finally, “dear abc–” [audience laughs] Oh. [audience cheers] But as I was watching the ID channel, This commercial came on, you know. And it goes, “sometimes suicide is misplaced homicide.” And then I was like, hey. That gives me a whole new idea. What the hell here? “dear ABC, when you asked me, once again, to come back And bail out your shit, low-rated network, I did so with the same sass and vigor That I’ve always delivered, and I gave you the highest ratings You’ve seen in 10 years. Unfortunately, network executives Are not what they used to be. It was your bright idea to kill off my character And throw me under every bus that you could find. Well, guess what? I’m not the one that’s dead, bitches.” [audience cheers] Ladies and gentlemen, my final message of the evening. Don’t wait till it’s too late to tell the people you love How you really feel about them. I think that’s the message I really want to give to you all. Tonight, go home tell those you love to fuck off right now. [audience cheers] Thank you for coming. Thank you. [audience cheers] Love you. Thank you so much. [audience cheers] Thanks for all the support you’ve given me all these years. [audience cheers] Thank you. I appreciate it. Love you all! [audience cheers] (singing) I’mma watch it.

       " ['In this stand-up, comedian Sammy Obeid humorously addresses the lack of global awareness about Palestinians, using famous figures like Jesus and DJ Khaled to highlight the region’s historical and contemporary complexities. He explores the serious issues of identity, conflict, and suffering in Palestine, labeling the situation as genocide and advocating for peaceful resolutions and understanding. Obeid reflects on the challenges of discussing such sensitive topics through comedy, emphasizing the importance of unity and recognizing the resilience of the Palestinian people amidst ongoing strife and division. Published on YouTube, November 12, 2023 * * * First of all, I think America doesn’t know a lot about Palestinian people, and that’s probably because America needs someone famous from a group to know about a race, right? And you think, like, who are famous Palestinians? Nobody really knows them. You have like Yasser Arafat and Jesus, and it’s like, who are those guys? I’ve never heard of them. Oh, and DJ Khaled. DJ Khaled is actually ours too, yeah. We’re giving him away though; you can have him. But, uh, isn’t that crazy though? The two most famous Palestinians in history are Jesus and DJ Khaled. They’re very similar when you think about it. Jesus and DJ Khaled. In fact, when they came out with the New Testament, they were like, “Another one!” I know a lot of people do get upset with that joke because I say Jesus was Palestinian. A couple of things about this, okay: First of all, the name uh, Palestine, traces back to a root that goes before Jesus’s time. In fact, Syria Palestina was what the Romans and Greeks called the broader area, so it was a term that existed. But Jesus specifically was born in Judea, and he was ethnically Jewish, but he was born in the land that is now Palestine because Bethlehem is in the West Bank of Palestine. So, if someone',\n",
       "  '’s born here in America 2,000 years ago, we call them Native American. By the same logic, Jesus is native Palestinian. And yes, he’s Jewish. He was ethnically Jewish. Jesus was Jewish and Palestinian; he was the solution to the Middle East in one person. Yeah, this isn’t a sermon, don’t worry. I’m just saying. I’m just saying. We know Jesus was Jewish because he didn’t celebrate the Christian holidays, right? He didn’t do Christmas. He really didn’t like Easter, definitely did not do Easter. Every Christmas Eve, he’d be at a Chinese restaurant, locally like, he was for sure Jewish. And we know Jesus was Palestinian ’cause he broke out of a cave in a matter of 3 days. That requires a tunnel. We know this. Jesus was Jewish and Palestinian, and black, for sure. He was black. It is nice that America’s finally waking up and becoming aware of how serious this issue and how this issue affects all of us. Watching everything fall apart in the last few weeks has been extremely disheartening. I know I come off as like, you know, I know how to put on a game face for shows, but I’ve been really depressed. There are people right now who are suffering a deeply tragic situation. People are being killed right now, and we are not over there; we are here in the first world. So, I think it is important for us to remember that we should not be the ones adding fuel to the fire. We should be helping. We should be stopping this madness. That’s my opinion, okay? Um, but the Palestinians are going through right now is, by definition, a genocide. You can get upset with that if you want, but a lot of people are like, “Oh, you’re changing the definition of genocide.” No, you didn’t know what the definition of genocide was. You have to look it up. It turns out there’s been a lot of genocides that you didn’t think about because that’s the definition of genocide. Here’s the positive',\n",
       "  ' part: The Palestinian people are strong. The Palestinian people are very, very strong. They’re the only ones who could be surviving this madness. You have good, innocent civilians fighting for their lives against the deprivation of basic human rights, like, we’re going to cut off their food, we’re going to cut off their water. It’s like, uh, have you heard of Ramadan? They’ve been training for this their whole lives. You’re messing with the wrong folks. This just brings them closer to God. Can you imagine if the people who controlled America’s water and food cut off our water and food? We’d be storming the Capitol tomorrow. We’d be eating each other on day three; the vegans would go first. You’d have like 10 January 6 at the Capitol. We’d be eating Nancy Pelosi right in front of her. Can you imagine if people blacked out our internet? Gen Z’s head would explode the first day. There couldn’t even be a genocide; there would be a mass suicide before it even started. So, people are suffering, and the least we can do is try and help and try to create an aura of peace. And this also means seeing through propaganda. There’s a lot of propaganda going on right now that’s trying to destroy the character of a lot of different people and divide us all. You have to understand there’s propaganda that’s making Arabs look bad; it’s a full-on smear campaign against Arabs and the same thing for Jewish people too, a shmear campaign. Um, if you’re Arab, if you’re Muslim, if you’re Jewish, you need to know that we are being divided and we are being torn apart by fucking warlords right now. This is not us; this is not reflective of our people, of our histories. And um, you know, correct me if I’m wrong, plus or minus, but there’s about 7 million Jews in Israel, and there’s about 7 million Palestinians, could be plus or minus, could be about six to seven. Jewish people wan',\n",
       "  't a Jewish State, Palestinian people want a Palestinian State. There’s only a couple of ways it’s going to happen: there’s either going to be two states, there’s going to be one state where the land is shared, or there’s going to be a genocide. Be on the team of not choosing genocide. That’s all the basic premise is: don’t choose the genocide. Mathematically, the land is to be shared, not taken. I wrote that myself when I was high. The land is to be shared, not… I wish we could just spread the whole world like a CBD Mist over the whole world at one time, but nobody would allow that. You couldn’t get that clearance through the government. You’d have to just a full-on Grassroots movement to just, and an indica too, no sativa. Fucking, we don’t need more anxiety in this world. Just spray the whole world down with an indica, get everybody in the couch, and then we can have a real conversation. Trust me, I’ve been making bits about the situation for many, many years. It’s very hard to do it without being a complete downer and also without coming across as insensitive. I also choose my words very carefully, and you can never satisfy everybody, you know. People are always going to get offended by one thing you might say, and then there’s the other camp of people who are like, “You didn’t go hard enough.” Somebody asked me, “Why don’t you make jokes about Israel?” I usually say Palestine because you can often get in trouble for criticizing Israel. That’s the other thing too; people aren’t pronouncing the names right. That’s a really annoying thing. I heard somebody call it Palestine, like this is in Ohio, bro, like. I heard somebody call it Gaza, like no, no, it’s Gaza, or if you’re Arab, say Gaza. Yeah, or Israeli, say Hamas. Hamas, even Israel too, Israel too. You have these Southern politicians like, “Israel, I stand with Israel,” like dude, if you stand w',\n",
       "  'ith them, say it how they say it. They say it Israel or as Arabs call it, Palestine. Like, learn just learn the names, learn the names. But my friend was like, “Why don’t you make jokes about the Israeli military? Are you scared?” I’m like, no, I’m an American, I pay taxes, I can make fun of anybody I support, right? The reason I don’t make fun of the Israeli military is that I’ve tried before, and it’s failed. I posted a joke about the Israeli military, and everybody hated it. Even Palestinians were like, “Take it down,” so I did. I listened to the people. I didn’t give up. I tried again. I posted another joke about the Israeli military, and people were like, “Don’t quit your day job,” which hurts ’cause I don’t have a day job, so I took it down. But I don’t, I never give up; that’s the perseverance of the Palestinians. I posted another one, people flagged it so much Instagram took it down, so yeah, I don’t do that ’cause when the people beg me to stop bombing, I stop. All right, just want to make sure I’m not bombing right now, right? I just want to make sure I’m not bombing or my jokes didn’t go up into the air and misfire. I just want to make sure that we’re on the same page here. * * * Your email address will not be published.

       " ['Girls and boys, please welcome to the stage. Sarah Silverman! Hi. Well, thank you. Thank you so much. I am so happy you guys are here. I’m sorry about the metal detectors. That is my bad. I, um… Tweeted something, and, uh, it made some people feel the need to express, um, wanting to kill me. And… I’m sorry I called for a military coup. I knew it was a long shot. You know, when you’re a comedian now, you really have to think things through before you post them, you know, on Twitter. Who do we think we are, presidents? Oh. Not necessary. But appreciated. I’m, uh… I’m not a fancy person. I don’t, um… You know, I’m wearing a onesie. I’m not… I have friends that love jewelry, and I love them. But I… I don’t really understand the value of jewelry at all. That said… I love a nice hotel room. I need a soaking tub. So, I have my things. And I was just on the road, and I got to stay in some really nice hotels. And, um, I’ll never complain, because I’m so afraid of being, like, a complaining Jew. Which is a stereotype. Based on facts and patterns. And then, like, deducing from those patterns. Why are you selling out your culture, Sarah? Sorry. Did it get a laugh? Yes. Okay. Um… But I did call down. And I was like, “Everything is so amazing.” Thank you so much. Um, but I… noticed there seems to be, um… semen on the… I think it’s called a duvet. And… Or a comforter. And also, um… There’s also some on, like, the nightstand. And, um, also, I noticed there’s come all over my tits. It’s… I’m sorry. I just, you know, if there’s a… I hate to complain. If there’s an upgrade to be had, I would… “in I’d take it.” Can you hear me when I just talk like this? This is a good sound system. You can hear me when I just talk like this? I, uh, got laser hair removal. And… Did you just applaud that? You’re like, “Finally.” I got laser hair removal. I waited a really long time to do it. Uh… I wanted the science to be at its peak. You know, like, we landed on Mars… I think it was August 2012. Are you just impressed that I remember the date? What I’m saying is… we landed on Mars in 2012. I waited four more years. And then I looked up the highest-rated laser hair removal place within three blocks of my apartment. And I went there. It was called LaserAway. And, um… it wasn’t what I… I think I was naive, and I just thought you go, and you get… And your hair gets removed. But it’s a much longer process. For every section of hair you want removed, you have to go have eight separate sessions, you know, like on each… So, for me, I was doing, like, from right below my belly button down to the floor. And then back up to about the middle of my back. And, um… Isn’t that funny that that’s funny? And it’s a lie. I did my arms, too. But, um… I can’t lie to you guys. I can’t. Uh… Right. So, they make you pay up front. Which makes so much sense, now that I think about it. Because… it hurts so much. By the second session you’re like, “Oh, I would gladly pay $3000 to never come back here again. That would be a bargain.” It’s so painful. And I have a… I feel like I have a high pain… I think most women have a high pain threshold. I’ve been punched in the face thrice. And that’s another story for another time. But I… It’s a different kind of pain. It’s like nerve ending… Like nerve damage. Like, they give you stress balls, and you squeeze them. And by the time you pry your fingers open, they’re just, like, pyramids of powder, basically. It hurts so much. I remember telling myself like, “You are a grown woman.” That is your money to waste. You earned that money. “Throw it out the window. It doesn’t matter.” And, uh, as I was walking back to my car after the second session… I actually can remember exactly, like, the words I was saying to myself as I was walking to the car. I was like: “What you just went through was trauma.” “That was traumatic.” And right in that moment I got a text message from my boyfriend, who was in Guatemala at the time with UNICEF. And it just said… It said, “I just spent the morning” with a woman who watched her son get murdered.” And I was like, “You think that’s bad?” ‘Cause I have… I have a hard time with perspective. Like, I don’t gain it with experience, I guess. I was walking around here in Los Angeles, judging people. And that’s not me being my best self. I’m not proud of it. But that was just the scenario. And I remember just thinking, like, “You fucking…” petty, small-minded, materialistic twats. “You do not get it.” With their, like, $1500 purses. It’s a bag. It holds shit. Get a backpack. You’re silly. You know? I’m like, “You don’t even get it.” We’re breathing egos, acting like we aren’t a speck of dust on a speck of dust on a speck of dust hurtling through outer space. “We’re nothing.” And then in the very next moment I’ll be like: “I want my face on money.” I really do. I feel like I deserve… I want my face on money, period. I just… I want my period face on money. It’s like: No, it’s more stoic. It’s like: Aw, I just heard my sister laughing. She’s dead. No, she’s here. I’m kidding. She’s here. I, um… I had a dog for many, many years. And he was my best friend. And I was always talking to him. Whenever I was home, I was talking to him. And then he died, and I stopped talking to him. Makes sense. Or does it? I don’t know. I mean, does that really make sense? He’s just as much a part of the conversation now… In a box on my desk. I stopped… This is what it is. I stopped talking to myself because there wasn’t a dog in the room. That’s crazy. So, now I have a new dog, Mary. I, um… I rescued her. Or I like to think she rescued me. I don’t know which is the less cunty way of putting it. But I have her. And she is my world. And, uh, I love her so much. She’s my everything. She’s young, and she’s full of life. And she’s obsessed with squirrels. And she’s kind of gotten me into it, too. And she’s just, like, such a cuddler, and we play. And we, like, spoon at night, and… I’m just gonna put a pin in that for a second and double back and say… that squirrel line, I would call that, in comedy, a throwaway joke. I knew it was gonna get a laugh when I said: “She’s obsessed with squirrels, and she’s kind of gotten me into it, too.” But you just keep going to that main joke. That’s a throwaway joke. It makes it extra cool. Now I’ve ruined it ’cause I doubled back and, like, I’m, like, talking about it. Now it’s ruined. It’s not a throwaway joke anymore. But it was. This is probably for two people in the audience, but I would say a throwaway joke is cool… the way that it’s cool, like… I play basketball. If you, like, during a pickup game, you make, like, a sweet three-point shot, and then afterwards, you don’t smile. You just go right back into defense. That’s the same coolness of a throwaway joke. All right. So… Really? That’s never gotten a laugh before. Well, you didn’t have to undo it. Keep laughing. So, um… The truth is, I am… I have gotten into squirrels. And now I’m gonna get you into squirrels. I’m not kidding. Wait until you see. I learned a fun fact about squirrels… that I’m so excited to tell you. I can’t… I’m… Okay, this is what it is. It’s this. Squirrels… cannot find 80 percent of the nuts they hide. Are you kidding me? Is that the greatest thing you’ve ever heard in your life? First of all, animals aren’t supposed to make mistakes. But secondly… I made this realization that is gonna blow… Hold your skulls in, because your brains are gonna fucking explode. That’s how trees are planted. Are you fucking kidding me? That’s how trees are planted. God, or the universe, or nature, or whatever the fuck, created this anxiety-ridden… Paranoid cokehead… that thinks that everybody wants their acorns. Nobody wants your acorns. No one else in the world eats acorns. Only you. That they hide them everywhere. And then they’re so fucked up on coke… They can only find two out of every ten. Squirrels plant trees. In Israel. Right. That I added. That’s not true. I added that. So, Mary is my dog. And I love her. And she got me into squirrels. And she’s young, and she’s full of energy. But… she’s dying… in that, it’s out there. It might be in two weeks. It might be in 12 years. But it’s out there, and it’s looming over me. And my heart can’t take it. I made a mistake. I shouldn’t have gotten another dog. It’s too much. I’m… Don’t judge me. I’m gonna put her to sleep now. I just… I need it to be done. And you know what? In my defense… in the scope of history… whether she dies tomorrow when I put her to sleep, which I’m doing… Or she dies naturally in 12 years, it’s not even a blip in the scope of history. It’s the same exact time. So, I’m right. And I… And she won’t die in vain, ’cause I’ll crucify her. Oh, my God. How cute would that be? I didn’t tell you, she’s little, and she’s got, like, long legs. And, like, her feet kind of naturally do that thing anyway. And then like: Oh, I would have to break her arms. I would. Listen, if you wanna be a legend, you’ve gotta suffer. You think Jesus would be famous if we put him down like a household pet? No. Jesus, son of God… died for your sins… uh, in his sleep while surrounded by his favorite toys? That’s ridiculous. I’m gonna… Okay. I’m gonna be indulgent… and tell a story that’s just a true story. Um… It’s about one of my sisters. I have three sisters. This is about one of them. Um… I won’t say which one. But… her name is Jodyne. Um, Jodyne went to Boston University. And if you’re familiar with BU, they have coed dorms. Which most u',\n",
       "  'niversities have now. Um… But they have coed bathrooms in the coed dorms. And Jodyne, uh, got the drunkest she had ever been her freshman year, like so many freshmen do. And she stumbled back to her room, and she managed to get her, uh, jeans off, you know, and just passed out in a T-shirt and underwear. And a few minutes later, the room started spinning. And she ran to the bathroom, and she started throwing up. And she’s vomiting. And while she’s vomiting, she can feel that somebody is tugging her underwear down. But she couldn’t turn around or stop it, um, because she was throwing up so hard. And she’s vomiting and vomiting, and they’re tugging her underwear down. It’s going down, all the way down to the ground. And she finally finishes throwing up, and she whips her head around to see who’s there. But she didn’t see anybody. Because she had been shitting herself. That’s… That’s a true story. I’m gonna say… Like, I would call that a relief laugh. Or, like, a release laugh. I know that I’m your show. But you have to understand, like, you’re my show. And you were so beautiful. You were so… You had so much empathy. You were so worried. You could hear a pin drop in this story. It was so nice. And, you know, I understand. You thought she was gonna get raped. And she thought she was gonna get raped. She thought she was about to get raped. And I’ve really thought about this. And I… I think this may be one of the only scenarios where you can look down at a pair of underwear… just: Just filled with your own shit… and think, “Oh, thank God.” Oh, my God. “Oh, literally, yay.” My sister came to visit me. Not the “shitting in her pants” sister, but the, um… My oldest sister. Although, I’m sure she’s shit her pants. She’s a Silverman, after all. Uh, no, this is my oldest sister, Susie. She is a rabbi. She lives in Jerusalem. Um… “Oh, my God, a godless comedian” and, like, a total God-person rabbi are sisters? “What must that be like?” is something you can muse about in the car. So, Susie came to town. And she said, “Sarah, I’m meeting my friend Amber tomorrow.” And then she told me all about Amber. She’s like, “Amber is so amazing.” She was born and raised in Ethiopia. She single-handedly ran an orphanage there. She’s so inspiring. I’m meeting her tomorrow at 8 a.m. “Can we use your apartment to meet?” And I said, “Of course, sure.” You know. “Use your key. I’ll be sleeping. But, yeah.” So, the next morning, she forgot her key, of course. And she’s knocking at the door, and I go to answer the door. My eyes are, like, glued shut. And I open the door, and she goes, “Sarah, this is Amber.” And I said, “Amber, it’s so nice to meet you. I’ve heard so much about you.” And I grabbed her hand. And her hand was a hook. And… Not important to the story, just for color, both of her hands were hooks. But, um… I was in too deep. I just… I shook it. I shook her hook. And it was such a false moment, too. I’m sure she would have appreciated if I was like: “You have a hook for a hand. I don’t know what the etiquette is.” And she’d be like, “Thank you for being real with me.” Nobody’s ever real with me. “Yes, you can shake it, whatever.” And then we would be real friends, and we’d probably have inside jokes, and that’s how it plays out in my mind. But… I just shook her hook as if to say: “This is what a hand feels like to me.” Bye. And went back to sleep. And pretended it was all a neat dream. But Jesus Christ, rabbi. She must have told me nine things about Amber. Two of them should have been hooks, right? I’m not being an asshole. Minimum. She’s got hooks for hands. She’s amazing. She lives in Ethiopia. She single-handedly ran an… That would have made more sense. She’s brilliant, she’s inspiring. Double back, just a reminder… she’s got hooks for hands. But not Susie, not the rabbi. She doesn’t see color. She doesn’t even see hands. That’s how amazing she is. I’m a… I’m a… I’m a very sexual person. Um… You can always tell a sexual person because they, um, tell you as a segue to their next bit in their stand-up act. It’s kind of a little hint. I am, though. I… I know that it’s cool to talk crazy during sex, and I… I have tried that. And it doesn’t work for me, because I just… I find that the truth, uh, gets in the way, I guess. Like, I… Like, “God, your cock is so… Oh, no, never… It was a shadow.” What I do, I feel like, is way crazier. I like to talk crazy right after sex. When things have calmed down a beat. Get right in his face, real quiet. “What do you think would happen if I went to the hospital” and got a rape exam right now? Yeah, what do you think? You think they’d find your semen all over and inside me? ‘Cause I do. Oh, I really do. Maybe you should tickle my back till I fall asleep. “Is that a good idea, motherfucker?” My boyfriend’s foreign, so, then I get, like, really nose to nose with him and go, “USA’s number one.” He’ll be like, “Number one in what?” “You don’t worry about it.” It’s important to us that we’re number one. “Juvenile diabetes.” What is the etiquette…? I don’t know if there are, like, any Emily Post-ish people here. But for postcoital cuddling, uh, or after-sex cuddling, if you’re stupid, what is the…? What is the etiquette for where I would put my… “his asshole” fingers? Is it just straight out to the side? Or… under a pillow? Or just… Just sever it. Just cut it off completely. That’s… That’s what happened to Amber’s hands. I’m kidding, you guys. Come on. Relax. It was land mines when she was 7. Look, sometimes I like to end a joke with a sad truth. Thank you, Jodyne. You’re killing it, Sarah. We give our daughters Barbie dolls so that they have an image of what they should look like when they grow up that is not attainable so that they can learn that they’re a piece of shit and they should kill themselves. It’s so important. We have to teach them young. I’m not sure, uh… who designs the schematics of these Barbie dolls, or Bratz dolls, or any of the sex-worker dolls. I’m not sure who we’re protecting. Uh… Where the obscenity lies, or… Okay, so, Barbie. Like, her legs are twice the length of the rest of her body. And her feet are just: They’re just on tiptoes. She can only wear high heels. She couldn’t wear flats if she wanted to. When she’s taking a shit at 3 in the morning, she’s in heels. ‘Cause she’s a lady. Her breasts… Okay. So, uh… she only has, like, the big, fat, shiny part of the breast that guys jerk off to. We have to protect our daughters… from the life-nourishing nipple. We… That’s just too obscene. No nipples. We can’t have our daughters seeing what nourishes life. Just the part that can sandwich a hard cock. No pubic hair. That is attainable. You’re right, audience. You know what? Thanks for keeping me honest. That’s important. It is attainable. Not everybody can pull that look off, but yes. People always want Angelina Jolie’s lips. And I’m not bragging. I basically have Angelina Jolie’s lips. It’s not all it’s cracked up to be. But, um, mine are in my underpants. But… That’s why I like a nice… groomed but triangular… nuanced bush. That doesn’t technically make sense, but it sounded fancy. I did a, um…\\nArt reflects life. Okay? And then, uh, life informs art, you know? And then, um… But we don’t… Movies, I don’t feel like really reflect life totally for women. It’s more of like a male’s projection of it. It’s getting a little better, but even in artsy-fartsy movies, like, if you see a woman masturbating in a scene, she’s always on her back. All dreamy and sexy. She’s never on her stomach, dead-eyed and slack-jawed, like it is. It’s work. We learn what love is from movies and television, and it’s ruined love for us. Romantic comedies, all that shit, it’s ruined love. We… It’s taught us that we are incomplete people who need to find that one person in the whole world that will complete us. I promise you, there are thousands of people that are perfectly good matches for any one of you. And I don’t want to be complete… I don’t… I’m working very hard to be a complete person every day, you know? I don’t… I don’t wanna make you whole. I want you to come whole. I want you to be in… And I know I just said “come hole.” Another thing Barbie does not have. That would be a really weird feminist stance. “Why doesn’t Barbie have a come hole?” “I don’t know. What is that? It’s subjective.” Noted. I did a fundraiser here a few years ago with, um, my friend Lizz Winstead’s organization, Lady Parts Justice. Check it out. And, uh, it was basically… I always say it was like a, you know, um, “right to choose” kind of thing. But it was, technically, literally, just for women in Texas. Because, at the time, every abortion clinic was being shut down in Texas. They were down to five. It’s since gotten much worse. But, um… And we just literally wanted to raise money to give to women in Texas so they could, like, hire a babysitter while they drive 12 hours to get an abortion. Or an affordable mammogram, or a, you know, pap smear, or whatever. And, uh, so, we did this show, and there were protestors outside. Um, you know, “right to life,” uh, Westboro Baptist Church-y, NPR people. And… Not NPR. NRA. That is… They are different. Completely different tote bags. Um, and they were outside protesting. And I’m not gonna shit on them, because I am them. We’re the same. You know, I’m the product of how I was raised. I was raised by a couple of liberal bleeding-heart Democrat Jews, and now I am one. And I would love to think that I’d get there on my own, bu',\n",
       "  't probably not. I’m the product of how I was raised. And these people were raised by people who loved them who said, “There are people out there that want to murder babies.” If I was that kid, I’d be like, “We have to stop them.” And I’d be outside there protesting. So, I went outside, and I just wanted to say hi and show a warm, friendly face to baby murderer. And I said, uh, “Hey, hi. Isn’t it great…? I just wanna say”, isn’t it great that we live in a country where I can put on this show because it’s something that I believe in, and you can protest this show because of what you believe in, “and we can occupy the same space peacefully?” And he said, “God, you’re totally right.” I’m just kidding. He goes, “You’re going to hell.” And I was like, “Okay, nice to meet you.” But there was, like, a 9-year-old girl there with a little pink cardigan. And she had a huge… She had a sign, like, twice her size. And it said, uh, “Abortion is bloody murder.” And the “bloody” was, like, in red paint, dripping down. And that was the first time I was like, “Oh, they had to go to, like,” Michaels or Blick’s or something and buy crafts. “Hobby Lobby, probably.” And she goes: “God hates you.” And I was like, “Do you really think God hates?” And she goes, “Yeah, he hates you.” And then… Oh, I told her a doodie joke. And she was like: It really is the great unifier. But she is right. Abortion does kill, like, your whole day. It literally sucks the life out of you. Look, I know those last two jokes, they aren’t smart. They have nothing deep to say. They’re just wordplay. But I love them like my… very own aborted fetuses. Um… Put a pin in that. Congratulations, Texas. Texas was almost the third state… uh, but then a judge put the kibosh on it. You should know this. I’m not blaming you for not knowing about this law, because we’ve been… Just atrocity after atrocity has been coming at us every day. But you’re not gonna believe this. It’s true. They have a law where if you get an abortion in those states or have a miscarriage, you are responsible for paying for a funeral for the fetal tissue. What? What? Crazy. And heinous. And I want to speak at those funerals so bad. He died the way he lived. The size of a sesame seed with no discernable brain function. He will be returned now to the soil… where he will… I don’t know, get eaten by a cricket, maybe. So, anyway, this fundraiser. This is the thing, is the religious right knows that it will be a bear of a… Not the religious right. I guess the government now… knows that it would be a bear of a job. To overturn Roe v. Wade, to just make abortion illegal all at once. So, what they do is they chip away at it from the sides, you know. They make little laws, insincere laws, that kind of are an ends to their means. You know, uh, “All right, uh, your clinic has to have hallways” that are 18 feet wide.” And then the clinics are like, “We can’t…” We don’t have… I mean, that would cost… We couldn’t afford to… “. “Well, I guess you’re gonna have to close, then, aren’t you?” You know, it’s very, uh, Boss Hogg from Dukes of Hazzard or something. You know, like, smashing your headlights and going: “Looks like you can’t drive. You got a smashed headlight.” It’s exactly that. And violating… Uh… Infantilizing laws about abortion where women have to think about it. Go home for three days and think about it. Yeah, I think I’ve been thinking about it, fuckface. Or, like… Violating ultrasounds, you know, where they shove a camera inside you and make you look at the ultrasound and see the life in your uterus. And… Put a pin in that for a second. Because I have another fun fact for you you’re gonna love. This is true. Scientists have known this for almost two decades. If you believe in science. That… And this is it. Sperm can smell. I know… I know sperm can… We all know sperm can smell. But… Sperm cells… Seashells by the seashore. Sarah, come on, focus. This is a big night. This is serious, though. Sperm cells have a sense of smell. They have olfactory senses. That’s true. And you know what that means. That means that sperm is life. And you know what that means. We’ve gotta legislate that shit. We have to protect the babies. I… I just wanna save the unborn babies. That’s all I’m worried about, and this is what we’re gonna do. The next time you feel like you’re gonna jerk off into a gym sock or down your shower drain or, uh… I don’t know why, I peg you as an “on the belly” guy. It doesn’t matter, though. It doesn’t matter. Whatever your jerk-off style, there is no judgment here. I was right, wasn’t I? I have a sense. If only that was a superpower that could help the world. But… This is what we’re gonna do. Before you do jerk off, whatever style it is… Um… I feel like keeping going. Like… you are like a hands-free fucking the mattress. Like, you’re just flat… Blink once if… I knew it! You guys are humoring me. You guys are nice. All right. Come on, Sarah. Before you do it, you’re gonna come on down to the clinic. We’re gonna take a long, thin… Like a knitting-needle-shaped GoPro camera, basically. It’s gonna go up your urethra, your penis hole. Up, up, up. Really picture it. And then down, down into your testicular sac. We’re gonna bring the ultrasound around, and you’re gonna be able to actually see the life in your balls. I truly believe… that most men will not even want to jerk off after that. And that’s a beautiful thing. Show business is so weird. I don’t know why this is when it really struck me. But I did an episode… A few years ago, I did that show, The Good Wife. Okay? And it’s, like, a law drama. And it was really fun. And maybe it’s ’cause I was, like, sitting and watching a lot of them shoot. You would never believe how show business works. It’s so crazy. Like, okay. Let’s see if I can explain this. Like… It’s… So, this scene is a big boardroom scene, right, ’cause it’s a law drama. And it’s got a bunch of characters in it. And they’re all talking, and all this shit happens in it. So, the first shot they do, they do a big, wide shot of the whole scene with all the characters and everything. They do that a few times. Then they go in close and they shoot, like, a tight shot where it’s just, like… You only see, like, three of the characters. And when they exit that scene, like, in our minds we see the whole room because we’ve seen it before. But in reality, when they’re shooting it, the rest of the room isn’t even there. It’s, like, filled up with, like, reflecting boards and cameras and lights and, you know, all this other shit, you know. I don’t know all the words. Cameramen and, uh, all that shit. So, it’s like, uh, Christine Baranski will go: “I want those papers on my desk Monday morning.” And she’s literally in her skirt suit and heels. Christine Baranski in a ball because she can’t leave entirely, ’cause there’s so much shit blocking the way. But she has to get as low as possible so she doesn’t block the lights for the rest of the scene, for the actors that are still in the scene. So, she’s like this. And then Josh Charles is like: “She’s a piece of work. I’ll see you Monday.” Everything you watch is that. I just burped. I’m a human being. I was, uh… Three weeks ago, I was at a red light. No, put a pin in that for a second. Okay. I took an acting class when I was 10 in New Hampshire. This goes together. And, first of all, this acting teacher was mean. I remember he said, like, um… Oh, one assignment was, bring in your favorite song and, like, act out to it. And then I brought in my favorite song, which is, like, um… ♪ Just a city boy Born and raised… ♪ “Don’t Stop Believin’.” Sorry. And, like, I thought that acting was mouthing it. So, I was like: And he went bananas on me. And you know, I wish at 10 I had the wherewithal to be like: “You know what? He’s probably going through something.” “That’s his.” No. I didn’t know to do that when I was 10. I just assumed I was a piece of shit. But that’s not the story I wanted to tell. So, the first day of acting class, he said this: “Acting…” “is reacting.” And I’m like, “What does that mean?” Like, “re”? I knew “re” meant again. So, I was like, “Acting again?” Anyway… Three weeks ago, I was at a red light. And I was like: “Oh, reacting.” Right. Oh, yeah. I agree with that, yes. Acting is reacting. “You should have said it that way.” Latent… realizations. That’s the theme of this chunk when I do my special. Latent… Latent realizations. Like… Okay, I had to go to sleepaway camp… every year since I was 6 years old. And, uh, it was terrible for me because I was a chronic bed wetter till I was, like, 15. So, it was a nightmare. I learned a lot of skills, like complete disassociation. Making a cot over soaking-wet sheets while I stink like piss and pretending like that’s not the case. What kind of parents would send a chronic bed wetter to sleepaway camp? They must be monsters. No. They’re not monsters. Here’s the thing. Okay. Like, my dad… his dad beat the shit out of him every day. And then during the school year he was sent away to goyim. To boarding school. I’m sorry. To boarding school. And then at boarding school… he got the shit kicked out of him every day, called a dirty Jew kike, because it was back when, like… America was great. And… And then in the… All right. That was pretty good. And then in the summertime, he went to camp and blossomed and was a star and was, like, everything he wanted to be. And so, parents, they just think… You know, he just thought, “No, camp is great.',\n",
       "  \"” It will define her. It will be her joy. Because that’s what it was for me.” You know? So, I had to go to camp. And as a compromise, he would give me joke books. Because I loved jokes. And then, also, maybe I’d make friends that way. So, I remember the summer I was 8 because I had just learned to read when I was 7. Someone in the audience when I was in Vermont was like, “I was 4.” Fucking good for you. I was 7. I learned to read when I was 7. So, I was 8, I was excited. I had books. I was gonna read. And my dad has no boundaries. I don’t know if he flipped through these at all or didn’t. Um, but it was Truly Tasteless Jokes book one and two. And I remember the first joke on the first page. It was a paragraph long, but I can tell it in two seconds. It was “Little Red Riding Hood, blah, blah, blah.” And then the big bad wolf is like, ‘I’m gonna eat you.’ And then Little Red Riding Hood’s like, ‘Eat, eat, eat. “Doesn’t anybody fuck anymore?'” And I’m like, “What does this mean?” Then when I was 30 I was like, “Oh, Jesus Christ.” That’s so inappropriate.” He was, uh… My dad isn’t… He has no boundaries. He’s not approp… I don’t really… He… He treated us like bros. Like, um, I remember one time when I was really young, he and my mom went on a double date. And when he came home, he, like, plopped down on the front hall… There was, like, a bench in the front hall. And I was sitting there, and I asked him how it went. And he was like, “Oh, it was the fucking worst.” Uh, we were supposed to go out with the Sterlings, and then only Mr. Sterling showed up. Because he said Mrs. Sterling had her period. And when she gets her period, it comes out like liver. “And I’m like, ‘I don’t need to know that.'” I was like, “Dad, I get it.” Like, I’m 5, and I don’t even need to know that.” But my dad, um… Camp was where he thrived. And, like, they’re still his best friends to this day. His best friends are his friends from camp. And he’s about to be 80, and they’re having a reunion, even. And he has a picture of all of them, uh, when they became counselors. And it’s amazing. It’s from 1953. And I said, “Dad, you have to send me this.” And he sent it to me with, like, a glossary of who everybody is and what they’re doing now. And it’s like: “This is Phil Holman. He’s a judge now.” This is Arnie Goldstein. You know, he owns Martin’s House of Cloth. This is Danny Gold. Danny Gold once gave Punchy Kramer a BJ and we all watched. This is Cy Schwartz. He works at the Clam King. This is bah, bah, bah. He da, da, da. This is Morris Simon. This is Punchy Kramer. “This is, you know, blah, blah, blah.” I’m like, “Dad, open with it or close with it.” He has no sense. So, he went to camp all the way up until he became a counselor. And, uh, you know, we think of counselors, like, as grown-ups. But, you know, they’re 16-year-old kids. So, for each camper, he had to fill out a form, uh, every week for each camper. And it would say, like, “Is he behaving?” Is he sleeping? Did he brush his teeth? “Did he go to the bathroom?” And under that it said, “L/H.” And my dad didn’t know what that meant. But he was too embarrassed to ask anybody. So, he just used his logic, and he’s like, “Okay.” It comes after bathroom, so it must mean… “‘loose or hard.'” So, for a summer… My dad had his campers come get him… after they took shits… so that he could go look at them… and make a rough guesstimate… if it was indeed loose or hard. I love that so much. It just means there’s, like, a generation of old men in therapy… who are like: “Well, I did have a camp counselor that was, like, obsessed with my shits. Is that…?” You were sexually abused. Oh, it meant “letter home.” But thank God he didn’t ask. That would have been so embarrassing. My parents got divorced when I was 7. And my mom went back to college to get her degree. And my sisters were older. So, I got babysat by nuns. I went to, like, a nun… A convent, I guess. But it looked like a… Like a Victorian house or something, where nuns were. And they had day care. And I have since met amazing nuns. These were not them. These were cunts. They… They were. They hit us. It was… I had not been hit before, you know. And I was so scared of them. Like, if we weren’t sleeping on our, like, little mats during nap time, they would hit us. And then, like, um, for lunch we would go out into the woods, ’cause it’s New Hampshire, and they gave us these peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches, and we had to eat the whole thing, or they would hit us. And I loved peanut butter and jelly. But this was different. It was peanut butter and jam. And jam is… I hadn’t experienced jam before. It’s like… It’s different. It has, like, pieces in it. But we had to eat the whole thing, or they would hit us. I was so scared, I… ‘Cause I didn’t know I could take a punch at that time. And I… Okay, wait. Put a pin in that. Put a pin in that while I tell you something. This is human behavior, that we tell ourselves horror… Horror stories. Horror stories. Horror stories. Horror stories. Horror. Horror stories. We tell ourselves… I said it too many times. We tell ourselves horror stories. That’s just the human condition. You know, like we go, uh, “I have to pass that crack in the road before that car passes me, or I’ll die.” That wasn’t just you. That’s everybody. Everybody does that. My therapist says it’s how we deal with mortality. Um, so, I was eating this peanut-butter-and-jam sandwich, and I was telling myself horror stories. And the horror story was… this jam is the nuns’ period blood. But I had to eat it all. I was so scared of getting hit. I ate it like this. And I gobbled it down. I don’t know what… put in my head that… jam would, you know, have, like, chunky liver-like pieces in it. Okay, I’m gonna try to tell you this story. I almost died this summer. I really almost died this summer. I, um… I was on the road. Had a shitty sore throat. Didn’t think much about it. Kind of turned into a cold, that kind of thing. Uh, then I came home, and I got that same sore throat again. So, I go, “Ehh, I’m home. I’ll go to the doctor.” Which I never do. So, I went to the doctor. And, uh, he made me wait, like, a long time. And I was going to go, like, “Oh, fuck this.” But I stayed. He looks down my throat, and he’s like: “We’re going to the emergency room.” I had a… Like an abscess at the top of my… windpipe, which is where your breathing comes from. So, um, like, this abscess was either gonna grow another millimeter and stop my breathing and I would die, or it was gonna explode, and it’s filled with poison, and that would kill me. Um… Don’t be scared. It’s really rare. It’s not going to happen to you. Unless it does, I guess. But… So, I had to go to the hospital. And then, um, they put me under, like, a general… Like a… Some sort of drug just to chill me out before surgery. And, like, unbeknownst to me, they’re telling my, uh, friend Amy and my boyfriend, Michael, they’re like, um, “This is a very dangerous surgery.” She might not make it. You know, it’s very risky.” Blah, blah, blah. Meanwhile, I feel fine. And I’m just like, “I’m not high enough.” I was complaining that I wasn’t high enough. And I can tell you exactly what happened because Amy had the utter distaste to record this whole thing. So… You just see me going like, “I’m not high enough.” And then they’re like, “You’re okay.” And then I proved to them that I wasn’t high enough, um, by explaining Brexit. And it was very nuanced, and I had opinions. It was, like, really perfect. Like, you can hear the anesthesiologist go, like: “Wow, she’s right on.” And, um… And then, uh, you see me, like, getting wheeled out. And then, um, like, Michael and Amy couldn’t come with me, like, past the operating-room doors or whatever. So, as I’m leaving, I said to Michael… Which is something we like to do, if the elevator doors are closing or something: “I wanna see other people.” And then… And then the last thing you see on the video is me looking into her phone and going like, “Play this in slow motion on my death reel.” So, um… So, then I had this surgery. And I lived. And, um… But it was really… It was a rough week because I have very low blood pressure, I guess. And so, they couldn’t put me to sleep for it. And so, I had to have… Once the surgery was done, they put a breathing tube down my throat. And then because it’s human nature if you’re awake to pull something that’s in your throat out, they had to tie my hands down. So, every time I would wake up, I would go to pull this thing out of my throat. And then I would see that my hands were tied down, and then I just thought what anyone would think in that situation, which is, “I’ve been captured by ISIS.” And it was so scary. And then a sister would have to come to my side and be like, “Sweetie, you’re okay. You just had surgery. They have to have your hand…” You know, and then I would understand. And then I would fall asleep, and a minute later I would wake up and the whole thing would happen again. And it was really scary. It was a nightmare. I don’t remember… Like, I was awake, but I don’t remember anything. And there were a few funny stories. Like, um… I would be really itchy. The medicine that was in me was so itchy. But my hands were tied down. And my sisters would fight with the nurses to just let one hand free so I could scratch. So, they finally did. And, uh, it was… like, I had an itch, like, just vagina-adjacent. And I… It felt… It was, like, so much relief. And then my friend Jo\",\n",
       "  'hn was standing in the corner. And I guess… I don’t remember this. I was told this. I pulled my hand out and then I, like, served it to John. And then, another time, like, my hands were tied down. And, um… That I served it? And then, um… He was like: In my mind. I don’t remember. Oh, another time… I was told, a nurse was in the room, and I, somehow, like, even though I had no mouth or hands, but I, like, made it clear to her, like, it was an emergency. I had to tell her something. And they had given me paper and a pencil. And I’m writing, and it’s, like, so important. And I finally finish, and then I show it to her, and she looks, and it just says, “Do you live with your mother?” With a picture of a dick. And, I mean… it’s really proof that once your conscious mind is out of the way, it’s just, like, sheer comic genius. You guys, we’ve reached the denouement. Were you making a noise because you’re impressed that I knew that word? Thank you. You’ve been very vocal, but in the perfect amount. You’re welcome. Like, the next time you wanna, like, be like, “Yay,” for me or something, let’s do this. You can go like this: Okay, the denouement. Did I say it right? Now we’re gonna have to, like, pick up a shot of you going: Um, yeah, because we’re here. Um… Jesus is coming back. Oh, on my back. That’s what it is. It was water. He turned it to come. How clever is that? I don’t know if there’s God. I mean, I cannot imagine there’s God. But I don’t know. Neither do you, you know? But if there is God, it’s a God that’s, like, totally fine with murder and, uh, children starving and… spin class. You know, all the… All the atrocities of life. I take… Spin class is great, if you love being punched in the vagina 70 times a minute. While just an ocean… Thank you, Steve Agee. While just an ocean of white people are singing the N-word with such glee. It’s because they play hip-hop music in there. Did I need to say that? Oh, my gosh. Were you guys like, “Is that what they do in there?” “Can I burn calories doing that?” Yes. I feel… I feel like a fraud because I feel like I talk so much about God and Jesus and all this stuff, and… I’m embarrassed to admit this, but I’m going to admit it. I have not read the Bible. I’ve tried. I have tried. In my defense, it’s unreadable. It’s so boring. It’s so dense. But it’s, like, not as deep as it thinks it is. And it just reads like a super-shitty Game of Thrones spec script or something. When is that coming back, Game of Thrones? – Not until… – June. – April? – June. – June. – June? It just was June. Oh, my God. I love it so much. It’s not perfect. It isn’t perfect, though. It’s like they… ‘Cause, look, everybody wears 900 pounds of armor. Then nothing from here to here. They just have this area to breathe. You know what the number one cause of death is in Game of Throne-y times? Neck stabs. Head-chopped-offs. Throat slits. I’m just saying, there’s a blacksmith in the fictional past that should be fired. The app that I do Twitter with, I can, um… I just sounded so old saying that. The app that I do Twitter with, it’s like I can schedule tweets. Which I like, because sometimes I’ll think of two, three tweets. I don’t wanna spoil you. I space them out. Many years ago now, the beginning of Twitter, practically, I scheduled a tweet. I scheduled it for 8:05 p.m. Pacific Time. Why would I remember that? Because at 8 p.m. Pacific Time… we captured and killed Osama bin Laden. The Twitterverse was aflame. At 8:05… I tweeted: “Why do my dog’s doodies come out cold?” Let me just remind you, I scheduled that tweet. That’s how good I thought it was. And I feel a little bit like Peter Sellers in Being There. Like, people put more depth on me than I have at all. I bet there were people that saw that tweet and were like: “You know what? That was cold. But it is our duty.” Okay, this is how I’m gonna end. I’m guessing this is a pretty godless crowd. Um, I like to… I’ve been on the road, and I like to end by asking if there’s a… Now I feel like a bully because it’s so godless. Usually when I’m in the rest of the country, I’m the only godless one, and then I don’t feel like an asshole. But are there any guys here that believe in God? Not like, “I believe there’s something.” I mean, like, an organized religion. Like Christian, Muslim, Jewish, bah, bah, bah… You’ve got, like, five seconds to raise your hand, if you’re close. Yeah, I didn’t think so. Really? Can you come up closer to me so that I’m in the light? But just come up to the stage. What’s your religion? Uh… I would say I’m Christian. You would say you’re Christian? There’s, like, a lot of different words we could use. I’m Protestant. I would probably classify myself as Lutheran. All right. Okay. What is your name, sir? – Troy. – Hi, Troy. – Hi. – Thank you for doing this. This is very brave. We’re in Los Angeles. It’s very godless. I draw the godless out. So, I don’t want you to feel bullied or something. It’s okay. I raised my hand voluntarily. What did you say your name was? Troy? – Troy. – Oh, okay. That’s fun. All right, Troy. I’m dying to ask this question. I’m so excited there’s a God person here. All right, you’re a Christian. – Right. – Protestant area. This is a question… that I think should be one of the big questions, even. Okay. Yes or no… would you let God come in your mouth? – No, no. – No? – No. – Okay, go back to your seat. Oh, my God, no. Thank you very much. Thank you, Troy. No. That’s mind-blowing to me. And yet not unique. Not a unique answer, I’ll tell you that. I would say the answer has to be yes. Um, but I will tell you that as I’ve been touring the country, 80 percent, at least, of men say no, like Troy. So, congratulations on not being unique. And yet being wrong, in my opinion. That is, uh, so petty, I think. You know, it’s like, up until now, Troy, you’re saying, “God…” I know that there’s AIDS and rape and famine and genocide and murder. But I know you have a plan, and I am your servant. Unless you’re serving come. “Then I’m out.” That’s so petty. God told Abraham to kill his son. And you know what Abraham said? “No problem. Chip! Get down here!” I know, I didn’t read the Bible, but everybody knows Abraham’s son was Chip. And Abraham was gonna murder his son. And then right before he did, God was like, “I’m kidding.” Can I come in your mouth?” Abraham’s like, “Is that a test of my faith?” God’s like, “Sure. Yes.” And then God came in Abraham… This is turning into fan fiction. But God came in Abraham’s mouth. And Abraham’s like: “Wow, I really thought that you were gonna stop at the last second like you did with the killing my…” Or I guess he’d be like, “Like you did with the killing my son.” God’s like, “I work in mysterious ways.” Thank you guys so much. – Okay. – I’m sharp as a tack. – There you go. – But they did just put something in intravenously. And it… And it feels like maybe… I’m getting high. Am I getting high? It feels like… It’s not that big a deal, actually. It’s not very intense. I feel like I could give a… I could argue a political side. Mm-hm. So, tell me… Talk me through Brexit. Brexit is like, you know, the same people that, uh… name their kids… Bentley ’cause they think that’s classy. They are the people voting for Brexit. Completely unknowing, innocent. Uh… Thinking it’s in their best interest. They’re voting completely against their best interest. These things that the EU provide their lives to make them livable. Uh, they’ve just ousted that. And they’re counting on the NHS, and that was a big sham promise. Mm-hm. Uh… You know. So, what are you gonna do? There are a lot of Bentleys in the world. A lot of Mercedes and Porsches. And they’re gonna be strippers. But some of them might be Supreme Court justices. Mm-hm. And I have hope. And I believe in people. We’re all just listening to the same… To different sets of lies. Maybe you should… – And she’s still making sense, too. – Maybe you should give her more. I am. I don’t feel very high. No, that’s right. No, no. That’s good. You’re perfect. You know… just if people were spoken to… This is what she’s like every day. By people who don’t have agendas and can just honestly make an earnest decision based on what they think is best for themselves and the country, we would have wild success all around. I know, right? But we don’t have that, unfortunately. I’m not high yet at all. This stuff is shit. Well… They’re gonna roll me into the ER and put me to sleep for a few days with a breathing tube. Some kind of new diet. Is that what you were expecting when you woke up? That wasn’t what I was expecting. – Okay. – Bye. I love you both so much. – I love you. – See you soon. See you on the flip side. Michael, I wanna see other people. Damn you. Okay, we love you. Love you. Bye-bye. Play that last bit in slow motion on my death reel.

       " [\"Shane Gillis’ debut stand-up comedy special, recorded live at The Creek and The Cave in Austin, TX, offers a blend of edgy, controversial humor and personal anecdotes. Gillis touches on a variety of topics, from his own haircut mishaps to observations on family dynamics, politics, and societal issues. He jokes about his father’s Fox News obsession, racial dynamics in football, and the absurdity of modern social media culture. The special includes candid reflections on his family, like his sister’s struggles with addiction and recovery, and his own experience coaching in the Special Olympics. Gillis also delves into political satire, poking fun at both sides of the political spectrum, and provides irreverent takes on pop culture and current events. His approach mixes dark humor with a candid examination of the absurdities of everyday life. * * * All right, I was thinking about the first time Congress had to come up with an age of consent. Imagine those in powdered wigs, that had to be a rough day for the fellas. It’s like some guy coming up first, like from Rhode Island, “12!” And everyone’s like, “Ew, ew, no dude. I don’t know why I have to go first on this one. It’s like the hardest one to go first on.” [Laughter] This is exciting. I was a little too excited. I panicked and got this haircut. What an insane f*ckup. My hair was fine, totally fine, and then two days ago, I was like, “I gotta salvage this.” It’s crazy that I thought the hair was the issue, like fixing my hair would make me look good. That was the final piece of the puzzle for me. There’s a Dominican barber shop by my house in New York. I think I’m the first white guy that’s ever been in there. I was basically Christopher Columbus of this barber shop. And they f*cked me up, dude. Don’t get a Dominican haircut if you’re white; you end up just looking more racist. It was nice though, he kept trying to reassure me the whole time, “No, man, your head’s good.” I was like, “Oh, thank you, whatever this haircut is. How are you guys?” [Applause] It’s good, it’s good. I’m happy, it’s nice, everybody’s back inside and all that shit. I don’t know, I had a good time. I live in New York, so I left. I went back to my parents’ house because I have white privilege. Some people didn’t get to leave the city, I did, because of my privilege. And I used it. You gotta use it! You know what I mean? Does it feel more disrespectful to waste it? You know what, then we’re all just being racist for nothing. But no, it’s good. I went home. My parents, I haven’t lived with them in over 10 years. They got old. They’re old as f*ck. I’m back on milk. Been f*cking crushing milk lately. I got f*cking milk fat this year. It’s a weird time in life to have a milk renaissance. I’m 33. It was nice. I think my favorite part of the year was watching my dad watch the news. It’s a rough year for my dad and the news. He’s a Fox News guy. Don’t do that. It’s fine. Also, I see you guys, most of you have Fox News dads. How dare you deny your fathers? That’s a good dad. I don’t watch Fox, but that’s a good Fox News mom. That’s fat. You don’t want Fox News mom, that’s a bad mom. She smokes in the house. But a Fox News dad, that’s a good f*cking dad. Can you imagine if you had a f*cking MSNBC dad? There’s some guy every night at dinner like, “We need to start focusing on renewable energy.” It’s like, “Ew, dude, I didn’t know dad was gay, talking to me about solar panels like a f*cking lady.” He might have her straight as hell, dude. We f*cking hate the environment. That’s how straight we are. All we talk about is eating pussy and fracking. We hate nature. We go fishing. We don’t even eat fish. We just catch them and f*ck… He’s good, he likes Fox. He watches it every night like every Fox News dad. My dad watches Fox every night until he can’t. That’s how long they watch. They watch every night until they get so angry they have to go to bed. My dad will watch for like two hours and then out of nowhere, he’ll just stand up and be like, “F*cking Mr. Potato Head’s trans, I’m going to bed. This world’s going to hell.” He’s all about it, dude. He loves it. Like every Fox News dad, my dad watches Fox with one goal. He’s just trying to get one fact. That’s all he’s doing. He’s sitting there, trying to retain one piece of information that he can then relay to whoever’s unlucky enough to enter the living room while he’s watching. And you’d think it’d be easy to get one fact, but every once in a while, there’s like a commercial for like a commemorative 9/11 gold coin, just f*cking wipes their hard drive. “What was I watching? I gotta get one of those. I got my hands on those patriotic coins.” [Laughter] My dad drinks too, so he can never get a fact, ever. He’ll come in the living room, we’ll be, he’s hammered, watching the news every night, which is the wildest way to take in world politics. Like, just hammered on a a recliner, like, “Whoa.” It’s like footage of rocket attacks in Israel, he’s like, “Whoa, what the hell are they doing over there? What’s this guy’s problem?” But he can never get a fact. Like, he tries. He uses Fox News as like a PowerPoint for what he’s trying to say. Like, everyone, like, we’ll be eating dinner and like Hannity will be saying something, he’s like, “See that? That’s what I meant. Look at that. That’s me talking. I can’t say it that good.” He can never get a fact. You’ll walk in the living room, he’s been watching the news for three hours, he’ll be like, “Alright, what’s going on in the world?” He’s like, “Do you want to know? I’ll tell you. F*cking Nancy Pelosi is a bitch… All right, settle down, dude.” That was the news last, that’s the news every night from my dad. They’re just like, “Breaking, did you know Nancy Pelosi is a bitch?” I had a feeling. But he likes everything they say. He agrees with it. He’s all in. I realize, like, Fox News is basically Black Church for old white dudes. You know what I mean? Like, literally, everything they say, my dad just, “Say it, like, ‘Yes, preach, Tucker!'” Every once in a while, he gets hit with the Holy Spirit while he’s watching it. The Holy Ghost visits him, he’s just like, “Oh, Lord, build a wall! Can I get a wall?” He needs a wall. My dad needs a wall. For a guy who lives in central Pennsylvania, securing the southern border is oddly important to him. I don’t know what he’s worried about, like he’s going to lose his job. You know, like some guy from Honduras is going to walk the whole way to Pennsylvania, just slam a resume down on my dad’s boss’s desk: “You’re here for the sales position? Stay quiet, also.” I was just at the border of Arizona and Mexico. There’s a wall. I had no idea. I got down there, saw the wall, and I was like, “Holy shit, he built it.” They were like, “No, it’s been here, it’s been here for like a century.” You got to tell my dad. It’ll f*ck him up. He gets fired up every night. It’s a crazy way to go to bed every night, just… So, there’s apnea mask on every night. You walk in the living room in my house right now, my dad, he’d hit you like, “Southern bord\",\n",
       "  'er’s a mess, right?” It’s crazy. But I make fun of him for it, and then I do the exact same thing, just with my phone. Every night, I just look at my phone until I can’t. I’m like, “Mr. Potato Head’s trans, that’s it.” Every day, I just get on, read opinions from people I know are dumb. Like, in person, I know they’re dumb. I’ve talked to them. I’m still reading their Twitter, their political opinions. It’s great. And my Twitter is crazy. It’s half where I’m from, which is the middle of Pennsylvania, so it’s white trash. And then half, now I live in New York, so it’s crazy, they all got Twitter, they all get f*cking fired up, they have like zero followers and just tweet into the void… They love it, they do it for the love of the game. And now all my new friends, they’re literally communists from Brooklyn. So it’s wild, dude. My social, like, I’ll get on Twitter, and the first tweet I see will be someone from back home that’s just like, “F*cking Colin Kaepernick better stand up. Like this tweet if you support the police, share it if you’re not gay.” “I’m like, f*ck it, I’m sharing that.”And then the next post is just one of my new woke white friends that’s just like, “I’m not racist.” That’s it. Every day, for the last year, just a different white person popping up, like, “Look at me, look at this article I shared to my Instagram story. I’m not racist, right?” It’s like, “Alright, are you sure?” I don’t know if you know this, like being racist isn’t like a yes or no thing. You know what I mean? It’s not like you have it or you don’t have it. Being racist is more, it’s like being hungry. You know, it’s like, “Yeah, you’re not hungry right now. But a cheeseburger could cut you off on the highway, you get hungry.” We’re hungry all day. The cheeseburger is Jewish in that joke. No, okay. Cheeseburgers, whatever, whatever type of cheeseburger you thought it was in your racist heart. Anyway. That’s it. I just get online, read opinions from people. The news, like other news, is kind of like, “This is the most divided this country has ever been,” say with the, like, the red states and the blue states. It’s like, “Why? Because we tweet at each other?” You know, we had a war, right? You know, this country had a Civil War. That was pretty divided. Like, at least nowadays, we’re communicating with each other. Back then, those guys never… They got the news like once a month. Some guy would come by on a horse, and they were like, “Who’s talking shit?” The guy was like, “The South is talking shit.” “F*ck that, I don’t like that. Give me my gun. I’m gonna go down there. I’m gonna walk down there for a month straight, shoot the first f*cking guy I see down there.” The Civil War was basically just the North just shooting racism out of the South. That’s what happened. The North was like, “South, f*cking chill.” And the South was like, “No.” So a bunch of guys had to walk down there and shoot them a lot. And they’re like, “Alright, we’ll let them go, but we are not gonna be nice to them for a while until we find out they’re good at football and then, Roll Tide.” [Laughter] Yeah, “Roll Damn Tide.” I don’t like Alabama football. I watched this documentary on Alabama football. It’s great. It’s about… Well, it’s not… I don’t know if you should say it’s great. But it’s about Alabama football. It’s about when they desegregated their football team. So, up until this point, Alabama football was just white, alright? And everybody down there was pumped about that. They would pack the stadium, everyone would be like, “Look at all those whites running around, catching it.” Hey, look, I’m not knocking them too hard because I still have a little bit of that in me. You know, like if a white guy catches the ball on Sunday, I’m like, “Oh shit, go, go, go, go, go! Ah, they got him. They got him. It’s a tough run, a smart run, heads up run there.” But no, they took it too far. And uh, so the documentary focuses on that. It focuses on Bear Bryant. Bear Bryant, legendary head coach. He was the head coach that brought the first black players onto the team. So the whole documentary is like celebrating Bear Bryant. They’re like, “F*cking way to go, Bear. You did it. What a hero.” And then you find out it was 1971. Yeah, well, a little late for high fives on this one, fellas. Holy shit, 71? Like, we had been to the moon. There were literally people on the moon before Alabama had black guys in their secondary. [Laughter] Does anyone understand? There were white corners. White cornerbacks. You understand how preposterous that is? Some of you are too young to have ever even seen a white corner. They’re extinct. They don’t exist. There are two left at the San Diego Zoo. They won’t reproduce. You’ll never see a white corner. But that’s what happened. It wasn’t like… The reason they desegregated the team it was — that’s what the documentary focuses on, which is great — because it wasn’t like\\xa0 “Oh hey, fellas. It’s 1971. Maybe we should get with the times.” What happened was Alabama scheduled USC, Southern Cal. Alabama was confident. They’re like, “Oh, white boys will take on anybody and then USC came down to Alabama with a bunch of black dudes from L.A. and just beat the f*ck out of Alabama. And then after the game, Bear Bryant gave like a speech, and he was like, “Hey, y’all, come on.” That was it. That’s all it took. Everybody down there was like, “Yeah, we get it. We’ll be less racist if it means we can win.” What? That’s what it is. Like, as big as racism is in America, football, that’s true. That’s true. Look, the GOAT. There’s a Disney movie, Remember the Titans, dedicated to what I just told you. The whole point of that movie was one high school football season. Remember the Titans was like, eight weeks. You know, that whole town went from like centuries of like, “Don’t let them in our school,” to just like, “Oh shit, the high school team’s 4-0. Those are my brothers.” [Laughter] All right, I’ll get off the topic. The point I’m trying to make, the point I’m trying to make is, if you want to get rights in America, you just gotta put together a good football team. You know what I mean? Like, if the transgenders got together and put together just a f*cking hard-nose, run-it-down-your-throat ball club, the trans, just three yards and a cloud of dust of transgenders, if the trans community could just somehow upset Alabama, everybody down there tomorrow would be like, “Those are some tough bitches… actually, right.” [Applause] All right, we got out of that. There are some rough patches in there. That’s all right. Well, this won’t go great either. [Laughter] You know how like every show and movie now, it’s like a remake of something? They just remake an old thing and just make it more progressive and just put it out. Like, they remade Ocean’s 11, like a heist movie, with all gorgeous women. That movie should have been 10 minutes long. They literally should have got to the casino and just blown the security guards. They’d be like, “Here are the keys to the safe. Take everything. I love you. You guys, you crazy',\n",
       "  \" bitches. I love you bitches.” It’s just… That’s all they make. They either make that or they make slavery movies every year. Those are for no one. I have black friends. I was like, “Dude, you guys like these?” They’re like, “No, we thought these were for you.” Like, “No, we all hate those.” Stop making them. It’s uncomfortable. Civil Rights movies are good, though. I like, like Judas and the Black Messiah was sick. Remember the Titans is great. Hidden Figures was the movie about the black ladies at NASA, or as my dad likes to call it, “Medea Goes to the Moon.” Look, that was him that said that. He said that. As soon as he said it, I was like, “What did you f*cking say? You don’t talk like that.” So every movie is just remade, more progressive. I just think it’d be funny if, like, the right started remaking, you know what I mean? If they just start, like, conservatives, like, there’s a new Scooby-Doo coming out. And it’d be funny if, like, the right remade it. It’s just like Scooby and the gang going around ripping the wigs off of transgender people. It’s like, “That’s not a woman!” Some guy, “I would have got away with it.” “We solved the case of the Starbucks ghoul.” [Laughter] Has enough time passed that we can admit that Trump was funny? Can we finally admit that? He was funny. Well, hold on, I don’t like the tone on that, that’s not what I’m going for here. “Yeah, the great leader…” He was funny. Now, whether or not that’s a great quality for the Commander-in-Chief, that’s definitely up for debate. But he was funny. I saw it. And I lived in New York, so the whole time he was in office, I would be like, you know, something would happen, I’d show my friends, like, “Look at that.” They’d be like, “What? It’s funny, okay? There’s nothing funny about Donald Trump.” I don’t… I don’t know. During Hurricane Dorian, he was like, “Maybe we should nuke it.” Like, that was a real suggestion from the president. The president of the United States. He was like, “Hey, we got a big storm coming. You guys want me to blow it up?” And I was like, “No, what the f*ck are you talking about?” “I don’t know, I just f*ck around dude. That’s what I do.” I don’t know. Now that he’s gone, I’ll never watch a debate ever again. Can you imagine, like, just a regular debate now, after we went like… We witnessed the GOAT, undefeated in debates, and he never said a fact. You know how impressive that is? He was funny, and he argued like a fifth grader. He was unstoppable. People tried to hit him with statistics and facts, he would just go, “Wrong.” Holy f*ck, dude. How is no one prepared for this? Go back and watch those debates. You forget how good, how electric that shit was. Don’t tell your friends in Austin, they’ll be mad. Just get a six-pack, toss on a Trump highlight video on YouTube. It’s a good night, dude. Why, I went back. I watched his first debate. That’s like my favorite one. At the time, Trump was pulling at like less than one percent. Like, he was nobody. If you guys like him now, you didn’t back then. And I know that because my dad, my dad at the time, any time Trump even came on TV, my dad was like, “Get this f*cking joker off the screen.” And then now, my dad’s like, “Guys can’t go to the Capitol? He’s like, ‘Guys can’t have fun anymore?'” It was because of the debates. That’s what did it, dude. That’s how we got Trump, these debates. And the first one is the best one. So it’s a Republican primary, everyone’s up on stage, and they’re all still doing their political shit So like the first couple of guys that talk are like, “I’m from Kentucky, and I love education.” And the crowd’s like, “Nice, we didn’t know what was coming.” Then the next guy’s like, “I’m from Georgia, and I love religion.” The crowd’s like, “Pretty good, this is a good one.” It was a heated debate. And then it finally got to Trump’s turn to talk, and he was just like, “Rand Paul is ugly.” And the whole crowd was like, “Oh, we didn’t know you could do that in this. You can just do that as your thing?” And Rand Paul was like, “Alright everybody, settle down. We’re trying to have a debate here.” And the whole crowd was like, “Shut the f*ck up, Rand Paul. Ugly bitch!” And we just kept throwing dorks up on stage to make him debate Trump. It was not fair. It was mean for us to have done that to people. These guys were in politics their whole lives, and they just had to debate a f*cking maniac up there who didn’t give a f*ck. And I hated him, but it was fun to cheer for him in the debates. It was fun to cheer for him in the debates because, dude, he was going up against guys that had been in politics for like 40 years, and then he showed up to the event like, “Oh f*ck, what are we talking about?” He had no clue. Every week, he had no f*cking idea. There’s one debate, there’s one debate, he’s like in the middle of it, going back and forth about the economy with Ted Cruz. They’re literally talking about the economy, and in the middle of it, he’s just like, “Ted’s wife is ugly as a dog.” Holy shit, dude. Ted was like, “I’m from Texas, you don’t talk about a man’s family like that.” And Trump’s like, “You’ve got a dog wife, Ted. Everyone knows.” Yeah, and a week later, Ted Cruz was on TV like, “I support Donald J…” He’s like, “You pussy” I will say this, the one thing that sucked about Trump losing was, for me, it was because I just figured out kind of how to do his voice. That’s kind of a bummer. It’s not hard to do Trump. It’s very… all you have to do, do that, do that a second off from where it should be in the sentence, and then all you… like, you don’t have to sound like him, all you have to do is get his cadence down. It’s very easy. All you have to do is describe something and then say you described it that way. That’s it. It’s every time, like, “What a big room this is. I walked in here, I said, ‘Wow, what a big room.'” [Applause] “Austin, a lot of homeless. I walked in here, I said, ‘Wow, that’s a lot of homeless’.” You guys got it. You got a lot of homeless. What are you guys doing about it? Whatever you guys are doing is not working. So cheap. Switch, I don’t know what to do either, but do something. “A lot of tents.” [Laughter] “Why?” It’s been making me laugh, thinking about Trump, like not understanding why people are homeless. “I walked out, I saw them, I said, ‘Why are you living in tents?’ I could never. These guys…” But I will say this about Trump, I don’t want you guys to get… I don’t want to turn this into a rally. I will say this, so don’t freak out, just listen. I will… I think it’s fair to say that of all the presidents we’ve had, I think it’s fair to say that Trump would have been the funniest one to see get shot. You know, dude, the patriots got fired up on that. Dude, I was having fun at this show. No, look, I didn’t even say it would be funny. I said funniest. It’s a huge difference. Technically, there’s the funniest of everything. There is. It doesn’t make it funny, but there is, like, think of the worst thing you can think of. There’s a funniest one. I’ll go first. I’ll think of one.\",\n",
       "  \" School shooting. None of those are funny. Zero funny. But maybe there was one where, like, the horse girl in the class, like, could sense something was coming. You know what I mean? They’re like, “What’s wrong?” And she was like… [Laughter] But back to what I was saying about, if you had… What I said was true. If you had to rank them, from least funny to funniest assassination, easy, number one. Really. He’d be talking shit, like, when it happened, he’d be doing like a rally, “My opponent’s gay. I walked in, I saw him, I said, ‘Wow, this guy’s gay.’ ” The shooter would be coming out, “Sit down. You’re gay.” Get hit. He’d definitely make a funny noise into the… Like, he’d get hit, fall funny. I will say, I did write that joke before Biden could be added to the rankings. I don’t think he would be the funniest, but the only reason Biden might be the funniest is because I think Biden’s the first president you could punch assassinate. You know what I mean? Just walk right up through the metal, “Texas, Mr. President, the hell are you doing, dude?” It’s a body shot. [Laughter] I’d add that joke… My dad’s… “He can’t be talking about killing presidents.” What about body… Music. My dad’s… He’s a good guy. He’s an alcoholic, but he’s good. He’s like a good alcoholic. He’s not hurting anybody. But everyone’s, he’s always got an excuse for why he’s drinking. That’s what’s funny about it. Like, he can never just get hammered and be like, “Yeah, I got f*cked up.” It’s always like, “You’ll see him on like a Monday, you’ll be like, ‘Damn, it’s Monday, you’re getting f*cked up?’ He’s like, ‘It’s Monday Night Football. Have a couple of drinks, geez.'” You’ll see him on like a Tuesday, you’ll be like, “Damn, it’s Tuesday, you’re getting f*cked up?” He’s like, “It’s Tuesday. There’s no football.” [Music] What the hell. And my sister does heroin, and uh, and that one, we’re like, “You do need to stop doing that.” Which sucks for her because if she played guitar, everybody would be like, “She’s a genius.” Instead, she’s a hairdresser, so it’s not as cool. Relax, it’s my family. It’s my family. Don’t worry about it. Actually, based on this crowd, I’m sure it’s actually a lot of your guys’ families too. And that’s all right. We’re allowed to talk about it. My sister, since she was doing heroin, we had to have an intervention for her. She lived out in Pittsburgh. We live in the middle of Pennsylvania. So we had to trick her to come home. You got to trick them. I don’t know if you know these guys, they’re not just f*cking stopping by. They’re very busy. They’re the busiest people. They get a bad rap for being lazy because they take a lot of naps. But if they’re awake, they’re f*cking…very busy. They’re scurrying around, dude, doing quests. That’s what they do. If you do heroin long enough, you run out of money. You got to start doing quests. You know, it’s… You know, it’s like a f*cked up game of Zelda every day. You just wake up to a new quest. It’s like, “You need to gather coppers. Gonna find a scrap yard.” It sounds nice. I wish I got quests. But eventually, the quests get pretty dark. Scrapyard, that’s like level one. Towards the end, the quest, you need to get titty behind the Home Depot. [Laughter] It’s when it’s time for a change. So we had to come up with a plan to trick her to come home for the intervention. The plan we came up with was we told her that we had won tickets to go to Six Flags. And it worked. She called back, she’s already, “Alright, I’ll be there.” Just got on the first bus. It’s like a seven-hour bus ride. There’s nothing to them, dude. No, if you take heroin, every bus is a bullet train. It’s a five-minute ride, tops. Anyway, so the plan was, pick my sister up from the bus stop, not take her to Six Flags. They could take her to a hotel, where we’re gonna have an intervention. I didn’t want to start the intervention with like a lack of trust, so I took her to Six Flags the day of her intervention. The morning of that day, she and I went to Six Flags together. And I thought that was a nice gesture, but it turns out an intervention is supposed to be rock bottom. You know what I mean? Like, an intervention’s supposed to be the worst day of your life, not like you’re tired from easily the best day humanly possible. I mean, she took heroin and rode roller coasters. It was… Dude, it was impossible. We sat down with her, like, “You better\\xa0 f*cking change your life.” She’s like, “I’m going back tomorrow.” And I was with her. She was… She was f*cked up. If you know anyone from Pittsburgh, you know what she was wearing. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants. Steelers pajama pants. She dusted off her finest Hines Ward for the occasion. [Laughter] So we get in there, there’s a water park there. We didn’t know they added that. We haven’t been there since we were kids. We get in there, there’s one of those water slides, it’s just like a f*cking straight drop. No sides on it, no raft, just by yourself. She looks at it, she’s like, “I wanna go up on that one.” I was like, “Yeah, alright, yeah, f*ck it… you know, I knew she was going to rehab like that night, so I was like, ‘Yeah, get this one in. You’re gonna have a rough couple of months here.'” Also, I figured they would stop her. She was wearing a Steelers jersey and pajama pants, trying to get on a water slide. All they did was make her take her f*cking crocs off. Her yellow crocs. So she’s climbing up this ladder, she gets to the top of this f*cking giant water slide. You like when it’s your turn next on a water ride, you got to lay there in that water and wait to go? She nodded off. She took a nap, up at the top, like a Dracula, laying in front of some high school lifeguard that’s like, “Uh, ma’am, it’s your turn.” He just sent her down, asleep, just flying down this thing, dude. There’s a ramp at the end. She hit it, and we all got to watch her wake up in mid-air. She did the whole f*cking… I don’t know how that wasn’t f*cking rock bottom. So, you woke up in mid-air. Anyway, don’t be sad about it. She’s good. She did go to rehab, and that’s good. Yeah, she’s done. She stopped using. She’s sober. She’s all good. Two years clean. [Applause] Yeah, yeah, it’s good. She did… Uh, she did get cancer, though. So… And COVID. Cancer and COVID. So, I’ll tell you what, this was cool. I got… I was with her. I was with her. She was at home. She went back to my parents’ house because when you have cancer and COVID, you got to go home. You can’t keep hanging out. But no, I was with her. It was crazy. She… This year, she beat heroin, cancer, and COVID. It was like living with Rocky. It was crazy, dude. Every week, my whole family was like, “Give up. You’re never gonna win this.” She’s like… Just kept winning. When she got COVID, I was like, “Alright, you’re definitely dead.” “I ain’t hear no bell.” Just wailed on it, dude. Yeah, she’s got a hell of a chin. A hell of a chin on my sister. And what better quality could you ask for in a human? Anyway… Damn, dudes. F*ck that music across the street, dude, that f*cking bother\",\n",
       "  's me. I’m an old man now. “Turn it down. Okay, now what is that? Rap? Turn it off. Gotta talk about my sister doing heroin over here!” This has been making me laugh. I’ve been thinking about like the first time, uh… Like, uh, Jesus Christ. I do comedy a lot, and every once in a while, you can hear music from another room. And it’s like, “Damn, dude, music’s so much better.” Every time I hear music, I’m like, “F*ck dude, that crushes what I do.” Some idiot dressed like Cam Newton pressing play. It’s so much better than this. You guys want to hear about my problems? This guy’s like, “Take Molly, finger someone. I’m gonna press play. You guys do you.” F*ck they’re having so much fun over there. Get the f*ck out of here, go dance. I knew you wanted to dance. That guy wanted to dance all night. Alright, I like my family. It’s a good family. I had to go to my niece’s 7th and 8th grade girls’ volleyball match recently. No, I’m kidding. I’m kidding, dude. Shut up. Just relax. I don’t want to f*ck kids, but if you ever want to get out of something, that’s all you have to do. Like, if your friend’s like, “Do you want to come to our son’s T-ball game?” Be like, “What grade are the kids in?” And then, no matter what they say, go, “Fourth?” [Laughter] No, I went to this f*cking kids’ volleyball match. Can we knock it off with volleyball shorts on little kids? It’s weird. It’s gross, dude. Just get them gym shorts. That’s all. No, dude, it’s gross because then, you know, it’s just me and the other uncles up in the… up in the bleachers, kind of making eye contact with each other like, “Bro, are you seeing this?” [Laughter] Such a funny way to just destroy a show, just right at the very end, be like, “Aren’t kids hot? Yo, give it up for Trump. Aren’t kids hot?” No, I am. I truly am serious about the gym shorts, though. It’s weird. And so I got home from this f*cking volleyball match. My roommate, his girlfriend played college volleyball. So I’m very excited to, like, shit on volleyball whenever I can. So I get in there, and I was like, “Yo, volleyball is f*cking…, that’s a weird culture. Get them f*cking shorts. Get them gym shorts. The shorts they’re wearing is gross.” And she was like, “No, we need those shorts for speed on the court.” And I was like, “Uh, I know that’s not true. I watched the NBA. None of you are moving as fast as like a ref, and those guys are wearing like slacks, dress shoes, for some reason.” She was like, “No, we need those shorts. The tight shorts, they’re essential.” She compared them to like a helmet in football. I was like, “I know they’re not essential because I Googled the Special Olympics volleyball team.” [Laughter] All of a sudden, those shorts weren’t so essential for them. What’s that about? How baggy do you think they’re… They look like the f*cking AND1 Mixtape out there. Offensively baggy is how I would describe all of their attires. [Laughter] We’re all adults. We can… This, we all agree the Special Olympics is a good… It’s a good program. I just… It’s great. I just feel like the guy who came up with it had to be like a real risk-taker. You know what I mean? That’s a wild thing to suggest for the first time. Some guy in a board meeting like, “I got an idea. We should be racing these motherf*ckers.” Like, “What’d you say?” “Uh, town over said that they’re the fastest ones. Say we settle it, you know?” I’m not making fun of the Olympians. The concept is wild. It’s a wild, like, if your best friend invented the Special Olympics and told you about it first, you’d be like, “Don’t ever tell anybody that. Who the f*ck are you going to tell that to? What are you doing? Pole vault?” [Laughter] I actually, personally, I actually volunteered and coached with the Special Olympics for a little while. So, you know what? You guys do… No, don’t clap, please. I did it for those kids. [Applause] I look like this, so me coaching the Special Olympics, I was like a f*cking double agent. No one knew whose side I was on, dude. Player, chaperone, no one knew. I’d be standing there coaching, holding a clipboard, with five dudes that looked exactly like me. I always see the coaches from the other team looking over like, “I think they got… I think they’re f*cking letting one of them coach.” Yeah, no, I did coach the Special Olympics for a little while. And it’s fun. That’s another thing, you’re allowed to talk about it. It’s happy, everyone there’s sportsmanship. It is funny. Don’t let anyone tell you it’s not funny, dude. I was there. Everyone there is laughing. It’s fun. I coached basketball. Kids would catch the ball, just launch it into the bleachers. People be like “What the f*ck are you doing out there?” My whole team ruled. Everybody, every dude on my team, they were the funniest. They were bros. They’re bros, dude. My whole team loved two things: they love tits, they do. I don’t know if you know these guys, dude. They f*cking love the ladies. And they love John Cena. That’s it. That was the news every day. We’d be in the huddle, they’d be like, “A lot of ladies here tonight.” I was like, “Yeah.” They’d be like, “What do you think John Cena is up to?” “Oh, you’re gonna have to get way worse before you meet him.” See, he’s just like the angel of death for those guys. I told my guys, I was like, “You see Cena coming, you get the f*ck out of there. He’s taking souls with him.” [Laughter] Every year, Hooters would sponsor our one basketball tournament. Alright? So, every year, Hooters would bring like three or four waitresses, and they would present like a big cardboard check donation to the Special Olympics. As soon as the girls entered the gym, the game changed entirely, dude. It went from like hugs and sportsmanship to just like dudes got competitive. Like very competitive. F*cking ripping down rebounds, just hitting layups. [Laughter] And then at the end of the game, there’d be a hug line, you know, between the waitresses and the players. And yeah, that went about exactly how you would imagine that went. We had to break out the f*cking jaws of life, dude. My boys, my boys were ragging on those young sluts. And I’m not knocking the players. They were totally in the right. The girls were hot. The waitresses, like every year, I would sneak into the hug line myself. Alright, I think I’m going to get out of here, guys. Thank you guys very much. This was a lot of fun. Thank you. [Applause] [Music] * * * \\n Your email address will not be published.

       " ['In his stand-up comedy special Live at the Lodge Room, Stavros Halkias delivers a raucous and candid performance, touching on a wide range of personal experiences and observations. He starts by humorously recounting his weight fluctuation during the pandemic, blending self-deprecation with sharp social commentary. Halkias then navigates through topics like the generational differences between millennials and baby boomers, the absurdities of everyday life, and the complexities of relationships and sexuality. His storytelling is both vivid and relatable, as he candidly shares tales of his struggles with sobriety, his adventures in dating, and his experiences as the son of immigrant parents. Halkias’ delivery is unapologetically honest and often outrageous, serving up a mix of poignant reflections and laugh-out-loud moments that explore the human condition with a blend of empathy and irreverence. Stav’s debut special was recorded at the Lodge Room in Los Angeles, 2022. * * * * * * [announcer] Coming to the stage now, the people’s champ, the crown prince of Baltimore. Please put your hands together for Stavros Halkias! Alright. Hell yeah. Alright. L.A. How we doing, gang? Huh? F*ck yes. Oh. Thank you for coming out. F*ck with your boy. How do I look, huh? Stop. Stop. Come on. You know, you know I had to come out here looking like a f*cking sidequest boss on GTA. I’ll have you motherf*ckers selling pornography all across San Andreas. Yeah. I’m happy to be out, man. I really am. It’s nice to be out and about. This is cool, being in a packed show again, you know? Sucked being indoors for, like a whole year, you know? Although, I have to admit, I had a pretty productive pandemic. I’m not gonna lie. I lost 50 pounds during the pandemic. Ehh? Thank you. Yeah. That was, that was during the second half of the pandemic. During the first half, I gained 45 pounds. So I kind of took the scenic route to losing five pounds. Yeah, dude. I was f*cked as soon as it happened. There was no chance. There was no chance I wasn’t gonna get fat as hell. You know what I mean? Yeah, because it was a scary time, right? We’re all, you know, we’re cooped up, we’re anxious, we don’t know what’s gonna happen. And I’m a very emotional eater, you know? Like I use food as drugs. But I also use drugs as drugs. You know what I mean? Like you shouldn’t be able to eat a whole pizza on cocaine, but. I’m five for five, you know what I mean? I power through every time. Yeah. Remember the first part of the pandemic where it was all Tiger King and online shopping? Remember? Where it was like, I swear to God, If this f*cks up Cinco de Mayo, I’m gonna be pissed. Remember that? I got fat as hell during that part. And I was f*cked up the whole time. I was just taking edibles like they were birth control, you know? Like an alarm would go off on my phone. I’d be like, Whoa! Time for 90 milligrams. Jeez, I almost had a thought today. That, that was a close one. I almost reflected today. It didn’t help that they made you feel like a hero for ordering takeout, by the way. Remember that? Every commercial’s like, Support your local restaurants. We need you right now. It’s like, Oh my God. Well, if called upon, I will serve. Hello? Yes. More lo mein. FAST. Hurry. We have to combat the xenophobia the Chinese are up against right now. More dumplings. I have to stop Asian hate. I have to stop Asian hate by almost stopping my own heart. That’s how it’s gonna happen. Yeah, I thought I was gonna die for a year in a row. Because I felt like sh*t. I would check the symptoms and I don’t know if you realized this, but the symptoms are just being fat. That’s it. That’s what they describe dude, right? Like every symptom’s like, have you ever had shortness of breath? Aches and pains? Or diarrhea? It’s like, every day since I’m nine years old. What do you mean? I had COVID in third grade, is that what you’re saying? Even loss of taste. Yeah, I’ve burned my mouth on a Hot Pocket before. Yeah, everyone young— I’m 32. I feel like me, everyone me and under. We’re f*cked. You know, it’s, millennials and under, we’re f*cked, right? We’re the first generation that’s gonna do worse than our parents statistically. You know what I mean? Which sucks. But the worst part is that our parents think it was because they were so smart. You know what I mean? That, I can’t stand that. I’m tired of hearing it from baby boomers. Right? Like their lives were so easy. You could just win a house at a carnival back then. You know what I mean? Just some guy, like. Oh. Nice. A three-bedroom. Awesome. Honey, we’re moving again. Yeah, have you ever tried to get advice from them about a job? They’re like, Well, did you look him in the eye and shake his hand? And it’s like, Yeah. I did that. Like, Huh? Well, that’s how I became the vice president of Circuit City. So I’m— I’m out of ideas. They all think we’re children too. These millenials spending all their money on lollipops. It’s like, okay, I need a CPAP machine, actually, but. And these lollipops have weed in them, by the way. So a little more expensive than you might think. Yeah. Sucks. They ruined the world. Global warming. That’s them, right? Not for anything good either. I think it was mostly hairspray, right? That’s it. Like every Bon Jovi concert took a centimeter off the polar ice caps, I’m pretty sure. Like, Oh, now I have to f*cking wash my yogurt cups. Why? Why? You wanted a Jheri curl so I have to rinse out garbage now? How is that fair? They ruined drunk driving. That was them, right? Come on. You know how fun that would be right now? Know what I’m saying? F*cking, get on one of those electric scooters four Truly’s deep. That would be sick. But no, somebody couldn’t handle their Quaaludes, so. But the good news is sh*t is only gonna continue to get worse. So we’re going to be able to do that to our kids. Right? I can’t wait to flex on my children. Right? Just talking to my adult son like, Hey, buddy, come on, you’re 30 years old. You can’t be splitting a tent with six people anymore. Alright? When I was your age, I only had one roommate, and I owned my Nintendo switch. So you got, you got a lot of growing up to do, pal. Okay? Go get a job selling your plasma just like everybody else. Oh, I need to be patient with you? You tell me about patience when you’ve jacked off to a dial-up internet connection, okay? When you’ve accidentally busted to a forehead that was still loading. Then we can talk about patience. When you have printed out a picture of WWE superstar Trish Stratus on an inkjet printer to jack-off to later. Then we can talk about patience. Now quiet down. The Boston Dynamics robot might hear us. Yeah. There’s no like part of the bit where I’m like, But you know what? If we all stick together, we— No I think we’re f*cked. Unless somebody, you know, shmassassinates Shmeffrey Shmezos. I didn’t say it. Legally, I didn’t say anything. You can’t get me legally. Yeah, we’re f*cked. Like that guy gets to just go to the moon and this guy will never see a doctor in his life. You know what I mean? Yeah. But hey, whatever. Just get us sucked off as possible. That’s what I think. Yeah. Focus on yourself, you know? Have some goals. Improve yourself. Have a good time. I got goals. I got stuff I want to improve. Right? I want to keep losing weight. You know, that’s one of my goals. For a lot of reasons. though, you know? Number one, I’m tired of being fetishized. You know, that’s. Not sexually but platonically. You know? ‘Cause people look at me and they think, Oh, Oh, there’s a big fat party animal. Right? But that’s a lot of pressure, you guys. You know what my Hawaiian shirt budget is? It’s crazy. You think I only want to do cannonballs? No. I want to do other dives, you guys. But everybody expects a certain thing from me, it hurts my feelings. I had a real fat boy pet peeve happen to me the other day. I dropped a slice of pizza on the ground and enough people saw me that I had to throw it away. That— Oof. That was tough. Oh, boy. Just gonna take this to the trash. Of course. That’s where I was going. That’s where I’d be going if you weren’t here. That’s for sure. Definitely wouldn’t be eating this with 10% less enthusiasm. Yeah. I had another moment happen where it was, like, really showed me I need to get back in the gym a little bit, you know? Like I was taking the steps on the subway and I fell down the steps, and none of the Black teens around me made fun of me. They were all just concerned for my well-being. Do you know how much that stings? To be too fat for the scorn of Black teens? It’s like, No, come on, man, don’t call me sir. Take your phone out. Record me! Make me feel alive. They wouldn’t do it, dude. They were just good Samaritans, it broke my heart. Yeah. I don’t know. It’s not just weight loss, though. I got other sh*t I wanna work on. I want to grow— I’m 32. I feel like I should grow up a little bit, you know? Like, I feel like this is the year. No more floor pills, right? No more finding loose pharmaceuticals on the ground, and trying to get f*cked up off what turns out to be heartburn medicine. Like that’s over for me. I am trying to stay sober, though. That’s real. I’m trying to stay sober. It’s been about four w',\n",
       "  'eeks, you know? Four weeks since— Alright. Thank you. Yeah. It’s alright, I’ll be back. Don’t worry. After this show, I’ll be back. If I’m being honest with you guys. Yeah, I just had to cool my jets for a sec. It’s hard, man. I— My problem with sobriety is I keep doing drugs, you know? Because drugs rock, right? Here’s how good drugs are. You know what my favorite movie of all time is? It’s this nature documentary about tropical fish that I watched on mushrooms at my friend’s place. And the colors were so vibrant and the story was so gripping. Halfway through, I’m like, Dude, what is this? I got to look this up. And he looks at me and goes, You are watching a screensaver right now. It’s like, Hm. Okay. Well, don’t touch the mouse, please. I’m rather invested in this right now. I’d like to see how this ends. Thank you. I’m trying to stay sober. I’m trying to watch less porn, trying to be off porn. One of my friends, he was off porn, too. I was like, Sick, dude, what’s your secret? Let’s compare notes. And he was like, Oh, I’ve just been having sex with a lot of women. It’s like, Okay, man, that’s not being off porn, right? You can’t be like, No more video games for me. No more Madden. I’m just on the Dallas Cowboys now. No more Call of Duty. I bought a gun, so. Take this for a spin. Yeah. I keep trying to improve year by year. You know, I was real depressed a few years ago when I first moved to New York. Things were tough, you know? And I was venting to a friend, and they tried to cheer me up. They’re like, Dude, you shouldn’t be depressed. If child-you could see what your life is like, he’d be thrilled. It’s like, really? That’s the metric we want to use? That a child wants my life? It’s like, yeah, he does, but for the wrong reasons, right? He’s like, Hey, what’s life like? Will there be ice cream? There’ll be ice cream every day. Sometimes for breakfast. For breakfast? Won’t that taste weird when you brush your teeth? You’re not— You’re not doing that that much anymore. Oh, really? Will there be sleepovers? Will I see my friends? You’re gonna live with four of your friends. Every day is a sleepover that you can’t escape. Oh, that rules. I hope no girls come and ruin it. I would not worry about that one right now. That last one is not gonna be an issue, unfortunately. No, that’s an old joke. I f*ck, of course, but. Things were tough. I’m not going to lie to you. Yeah. When I first moved to New York, I didn’t have my own room. I had the corner of a large living room, and I’m glad I’m out of there. But there is something I miss about that. There’s a certain level of camaraderie that comes with that kind of poverty. You know? Like, I miss clowning your boy when you heard him bust too fast. You know what I mean? Because there was five of us in a three-bedroom. Everybody knew the exact tempo everybody else f*cked at in that apartment. There was nothing funnier than hearing that IKEA bed frame stop squeaking just a little too fast. You know? Letting out an audible laugh that cut through your paper-thin walls. Pretty soon, everybody’s joining in. Ha ha ha ha. It was nice. Yeah. I’m doing better now, though. You know? Things are pretty good. I grew up pretty poor. I was poor until pretty recently. And I’m not poor anymore. But I’m not rich either. What I am is the richest a poor person could ever imagine becoming. You know what I mean? Like, I’m get appetizers every time rich, you know? Like, it’s not just for birthdays anymore. I’m dipping sauce rich, a lot, a lot of my money is tied up in ranch right now. I’m big ass TV, No health insurance rich, right? I got Xbox and PlayStation, but no Blue Cross/Blue Shield. That’s. Yeah, I don’t know. I did do one smart thing. I did do one kind of like investment thing. I bought a house. That’s something, right, guys? Thank you. It’s in the sh*tty neighborhood I grew up in. I grew up in southeast Baltimore. Greektown. I grew up in season two of The Wire to tell you, basically. Pretty easy to get a house there. I’m not gonna lie to you. To give you an idea, when we moved in, one of our neighbors warned us that the other neighbor was gay. So. You get a little idea of what the property values are like over there. Right? And the way he did it was hilarious, too, because he was like, Listen. Good guy and everything, but watch out. For what? What am I watching out for? What is this man? Some kind of gay raccoon? You know what I mean? Like, Hey, buddy. You’re gonna want to lock your dicks up overnight, okay? Cover ’em, chain ’em up, bring ’em indoors. This man’s got a real nose for a penis. Alright? He will get to a cock, I promise you that. Got me a couple times. Stay safe out there. Yeah, we got the best white trash in Baltimore, dude. Extra strength white trash. They got their own little dialect. You know? If you were talking to a guy that I grew up around, here’s how the conversation would go. It would be the dumbest thing you’ve ever heard, sounding horrible, but with the most confidence, right? It’s always some guy that’s like, Yo. You know what I don’t understand about traffic? Why don’t the guy in the front just go. Just f*cking go. That “oh” is brutal. It’s the trademark. It’s like a domestic abuse air raid siren. Ooooooh. Yo, I heard if you don’t pay child support for both your kids, that’s double jeopardy. They can’t get you on that one. You got to know your rights, brother. You got to know your rights. One of my friends overheard a guy in a 7-Eleven go, Damn it, Mikey spent all my sweatpants money on Doritos. What the f*ck does that mean? What could it possibly mean? Is the money in sweatpants? Is it for sweatpants? If it’s for sweatpants, why does your clothing cost as much as snacks? That’s my community, baby. Yeah, that’s— It’s a funny neighborhood, you know? It’s a bunch of those guys and then a bunch of, like, recent immigrants from South and Central America. And then a bunch of Greek people that are mad that immigrants are stealing their neighborhood. It’s a bunch of old Greek guys that are like, You know, they don’t even, they don’t even speak English. It’s like, Okay, man, you don’t speak English, right? What’s the issue? Yeah. It was a fun little immigrant upbringing over there. Any immigrants here? Yeah. Yeah? Nice. Where you from? Mexico. Mexico. Nice. Classic. Does that count here? Like this is Mexico, right? Like, it should be Mexico. But do you like your parents? Yeah. Yeah? Both of them? Both of them. Both? You don’t like one more than the other? The mom more than the dad. The mom more than dad. When’s the last time you and your dad hugged? Uhhh… We got him. Nah, it’s all good, dude. For me, me and my dad, It was the last time Greece got to the quarterfinals of the World Cup. That was— Yeah. Yeah. I don’t know if you guys know this. I don’t know if this is your experience, but immigrants, one of their favorite parenting techniques is child abuse. I don’t know if you guys knew that. Like, my dad didn’t hit us that much, but his go-to move was this, was just like. Do your f*cking homework. And to this day, he’ll be like, Well, come on, I never hit you. And it’s like, Yeah, but you always could have, you know? Never really felt off the table, Pops. I had a lot of friends from similar backgrounds. You know, I think you kind of attract that. And, you know, one of my buddies, we, we became really close later in life, and he’s still one of my best friends today. But when we were first friends, he was like opening up to me, you know? He was confiding in me and he was like, Yeah, dude. My dad used to just get f*cked up off wine coolers and beat the sh*t out of me. And, I knew it shouldn’t have tripped me up, but I was like, I’m sorry, dawg. You said wine coolers? Yeah. I just knew when I came home and I saw that daiquiri mix in the freezer I was in for a long night of being whipped with maraschino cherry stems. I didn’t get a lot of lessons from my dad. I’ll be honest. I didn’t, you know, he didn’t teach me a lot of stuff. I didn’t get a sex talk even. You know? The closest I got to a sex talk was one time, we were in Greece, and he was watching pornography just in the living room. Not, not in his chambers. Right? And it’s a James Bond-themed porno. And when James Bond starts getting sucked off, my dad looks at me. He’s like, Ehh? F*ckin’ ehh. And that was my sex talk. Just watching a British man get head with my father. Yeah, I’ll give him some credit, though. He was a really good dad when I was a little kid, you know? And then I think when I was like 10 or 11, he had a heart attack and he had one of those, like, near-death experience, moments of clarity. He was like, Oh my God, what have I been doing with my time on Earth? I have to start cheating on my wife. I can’t. I can’t be a present father. I have to buy a leather jacket from Costco and get pussy. Yeah, he cheated on my mom, and I don’t know how. Right? Like, if you’re some sexy rich guy, I get it. I don’t condone it, but I see what happened. What happened with my dad? Did some woman look at him and go, Oh, my God. When I saw that hunched-over Greek contractor take a piece of loose salami out of his pocket and eat it while laughing at a man in a wheelchair, I knew I had to have him. The way',\n",
       "  ' his shoulder hair waved in the wind. Yeah. I don’t know. I’ve been going to therapy, though. You know? Any therapy heads in the building? Nice. What’s your biggest trauma? I’m kidding. No, I’m just a little light crowdwork, huh? No, I’ve been going to therapy a bunch, and I have empathy for my dumbass dad, you know? That suck, you know? Seeing it from his side, you know? Because, look, was he the best dad in the world? No. But did he do his best? Also no. But, you know, whatever, he gave it a hot 65%. He did— I’ll give him credit again. He gave me a better childhood than he had, right? That’s really all you can ask on some level. Like his family was all f*cked up. Here’s how my dad’s parents met. Right? This is Greece in the forties, right? It’s still arranged marriages. And no one in my grandfather’s village wants to marry him. Nobody. Doesn’t matter how many goats they throw in the trade. No one’s biting, right? No one in mainland Greece will marry him, which is actually kind of impressive, right? Like there’s no Internet. This is word of mouth spreading about what a piece of sh*t he is, right? Basically, what they end up doing is they catfish a family on an island eight hours away. Right? There’s no way for them to meet before the wedding. They do the deal through letters. Finally, it’s set. Everything’s good to go. They take this eight-hour boat ride out to this woman’s island. And the second my grandfather steps off the boat, the woman he’s supposed to marry looks at him and goes, No, absolutely not. I’m not, I’m not marrying this guy. And then her dad goes, Oh, geez, well, you came all this way. Why don’t you marry my other daughter? And those are my grandparents. That’s them. Wild, right? Have you had like a bad Craigslist roommate? And you’re like, Oh, once this lease is up, I am out of here. Imagine if that lease was your whole life and that roommate creampied you because that, that was my grandma’s life. And, yeah. You’d think something like that would make somebody a bitch. And you would be correct in this instance, actually. I feel bad and everything, but really a tough hang. I’ll be honest with you guys. I went to visit her actually on her deathbed, and she had pretty bad dementia by the time I got to see her. And I’m trying to communicate with her. And she just looks at me and she goes, Who are you? You got fatter. It’s like, okay, pick one. Okay? Either you don’t know who I am or you don’t know I got fatter. That’s how that works. But I got to hand it to her. You know, she snuck one in right at the buzzer. Three, two, one. You’re fat. [buzzer sound] One of the best to ever do it folks. Hang her moomoo up in the rafters. I like my family though. They are pretty funny. My mom’s mom is funny too. My grandma on the other side. She’s great. She’s very accepting, but very ignorant at the same time. Which is a really funny combo. Like over the holidays, a couple of years ago, we watched this old Greek movie, and one of the characters, it’s revealed, thinks Jews drink blood, you know? And it’s like an old movie. He’s the village idiot. It’s obviously a joke. Everyone’s making fun of him. Everybody’s laughing. I look at my family, they’re laughing. I look at my grandma. She’s like, confused. I am like, Oh, Grandma, isn’t this hilarious? This guy thinks Jews drink blood. And she’s like, Well, yeah, but. They do, right? But the way she said it was, And you shouldn’t judge other people’s cultures, Stavros. What? You think Jews are vampires? But we should let it slide for diversity reasons? Incredible perspective, yia-yia. She’s great. But I will say, the more time I spend around Greek people, the more time I think it’s crazy the kinds of immigrants we’re banning in this country. You know, like it should be us, right? Like, we got enough Europeans, right? Like a racist might be like, Oh, well, we can’t have refugees from the Middle East. What if they commit sex crimes? It’s like, okay, well, have you ever met an Italian man? Have you ever tried to purchase pizza in this country one time? Hey, bella, how old you are? That guy’s getting waved through customs. Why? F*ck. You know how Inuit people have, like, 30 words for “snow” in their language? Italian is similar in that they don’t have a single word for “consent” in theirs. No, I shouldn’t sh*t on Italians. I’m Greek. We’re basically Italians that peaked in high school, right? We’ve been coasting on democracy for quite some time now. It is a gorgeous place, though. I do love visiting over there. It f*cking rocks. I remember I took a visit there a couple of years ago with my girlfriend at the time. And when you take an international trip like that with somebody, you learn a lot about each other. We’re gone for 10 days, just me and her. And what we learned is that we did not want to be together anymore. That was the big takeaway for us. Kind of tough, I’ll be honest with you, to break up on vacation, you know? That’s not how you see your chase Chase Sapphire Rewards going, you know? You ever paid $3,000 to be the saddest you’ve ever been? It was my fault, though. I took a rich girl on vacation. Right? Rich people don’t give a f*ck about vacations. Poor people, could you imagine breaking up on vacation? The only good week of your life? You’re not. You’re not doing that. But don’t get me wrong. She wasn’t like evil rich, right? She’s not space-for-fun rich. But I’ll put it this way. When the shampoo ran out in her home, they just threw the bottle away. Right? There was, there was no filling it with water and living off bubbles for a week, you know? She never had sh*tty bubbles hair. Right? There were no omelets for dinner, you know? Like, Whoa, hot dogs again? Mom’s the coolest! No buddy. Mom is not that cool. These are struggle dogs right here. We got to make these last till dad’s disability check comes in. Yeah, I don’t know if you know this, but making a pack of Hebrew Nationals last eight days, that’s actually white trash Hannukuh. Thanks. You know, it was a good relationship while it lasted. I’m not bitter. You know, things end. And we had a good time. We had a good sex life. You know, we were really into roleplaying. Anybody here? Roleplay? Nice. What do we do? Huh? Say it again. —Um, like schoolgirl. Schoolgirl. Classic. Very nice. Yeah, that’s good. Is this like teacher/schoolgirl or just like schoolgirl? Schoolgirl/schoolgirl. Schoolgirl/schoolgirl? Now we’re talking. Wow. A twist on an old classic. The Bud Light Lime of roleplaying. Nice. Hell yeah. I really like roleplaying because I always pick a guy that comes really fast. That’s my, that’s my character, is a guy that busts quick and then plays NBA2K for like a half hour. I really commit to that one. I’m sort of a method actor when it comes to that one. Yeah. I could tell, though, in hindsight that that relationship was kind of losing some steam. You know? I think you can tell in the way you initiate sex when the passion starts to go. You know, like when we first started dating, we’d go on these long dates, we’d talk for hours, there’d be a spark, we’d kiss. I’d be like, Wow, this is really gonna happen. The way I knew we were gonna have sex at the end of the relationship is, if I went to the bathroom and she was like, Wash your hands with soap this time! Like, hell yeah dude. Nice. Why’s she want ’em clean, huh? She’s not trying to get crumbs in there. That’s why. I’m about to have sex. It was good, though. I did— I learned a lot about myself being in a long-term relationship, you know? Like I learned I’m more traditional in some ways than I realize, even though I consider myself a feminist overall. You know? Like, do I want my girlfriend to shave her legs? Yes. But I will allow her to support me financially. So I’m sort of a modern guy in that sense. Thank you. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Please. I’m just doing my part. Nah, I’m a feminist, though. You know, that part’s real. And I think my, my favorite part of feminism is the concept of mansplaining, you know, because basically that means men aren’t allowed to explain anything anymore, which means I could just be dumb as hell. Right? Like, if one of my friends, if she’s like, Hey, what’d you think of this book? I’d be like, Hm, nice try. I see what you’re up to, but I’m not reading anymore. I’m a feminist. Thank you very much. Yeah, but anyway, that relationship’s over. It’s been over for a while. I’ve just been out there. Just a fat little slut. Just f*cking— Thank you. Just toss this little weiner around town, you know what I mean? Just throwing this five-and-three-quarters everywhere, you know? Six on its tippy toes. Don’t worry. Was this summer as slutty as you guys thought it was gonna be? No, right? It wasn’t that good, right? Pissed me off. I was f*cking ready, dude. Everyone was building it up. Everyone was like, We’ve been locked up for a year. People are going crazy. They’re going to be sucking and f*cking in the streets, you know? That was not my experience, I have to be honest. I think what happened is everyone was very excited. Everybody was like, went out one time, got crazy, f*cked, and then looked around, and was like, This sh*t’s still pretty bad out here, actually. The president just has a different kind of dementia now. No',\n",
       "  ' one’s really fixed anything, but there’s less funny tweets now. Yeah. I was pissed. I was ready for this horny summer. Right? I grew my hair out for this sh*t, you know what I mean? I was bald when the pandemic started. I was like, F*ck it, let’s see what happens. I’m trying to get my sh*t tugged on, you know what I mean? But it didn’t happen, dude. I had big plans. I was going to get pegged by somebody’s wife on a hammock, you know? Some big naturals on my shoulders. But the best laid plans of mice and men. You know what I mean? I was having this conversation with my gay friends, right? I was talking about the summer and I was complaining and they’re like, What do you mean? You don’t have sex? We’re having sex all the time. That’s not fair, you guys. A gay guy making fun of a straight guy for not having enough sex, is like a Harlem Globetrotter making fun of an NBA player for not scoring enough points, you know? It’s like, Come on, man. No one plays defense in your league, right? A lot of, lot of showmanship. Yeah, a lot of confetti. But not a lot of fundamentals, is all I’m saying. Yeah, I don’t know, though. I’m 32. You know, maybe it’s time I started doing some gay sh*t, you know? Looks like fun, you know? Like no one’s ever come in my mouth, but I love an overeasy egg. How different could it really be? Be honest with yourselves right now. It’s probably pretty close. Throw a little Tabasco on the guy’s cock, you know what I mean? Take me to brunch, big dog. There’s some pissed off dudes in the crowd right now. Hard scrambled from now on! I will not have gay eggs! Nah, I don’t know. Maybe that’s a little far for me too, is uh, sucking a man off with hot sauce in my mouth. But I want to expand the sexual repertoire a little bit. You know, I want some new moves. I’ve been doing some different stuff. I’ve been doing the pineapple thing, you know? Supposed to make it taste better, but everybody hates it no matter how much pineapple I put in my foreskin. And I don’t— What? Just chunk after chunk. What am I doing wrong? That might be the stupidest thing I say tonight. Here’s my real move, though, you know, here. Here it is. Because I was always jealous when you’re hooking up with a girl, and then she puts your hair up, like, suggestively, and it’s like, Uh oh. You know what’s coming next. That’s why what I’ve been doing is when I’m hooking up with a girl and I’m about to go down on her, I take out a huge bib. Num num num num num num num. That’s my move. I better not hear about anybody in L.A. doing the bib. Okay? That’s mine. And you definitely cannot say “my compliments to the chef” afterwards. That ties it all together. But I’ve been out there. I’ve been dating a little bit. You know? I was dating mostly younger women, not on purpose. Just because no one my age wants to be with me, you know? Like I’m 32. Girls my age want, like, stability, you know, they want, like, a real job. Health insurance. I could get you mushrooms pretty easily, you know? Like, that’s a style of 30-year-old I am. I don’t know what an IRA is, but I have acid on me right now. Sometimes people are condescending if you date somebody younger. They’ll be like, Oh, I’m sure the conversation was very intellectually stimulating. And you know what? I’m very stupid. So, yeah, it was. I’m learning a lot from these girls, a lot about astrology, I’ll tell you that much. They love the stuff. Everyone’s pretty freaky now too, I realize. Everyone I feel like has to bust in a strange way, you know? Like a girl I was with recently wanted to be tied up and then also pretend she was sleeping. And it’s like, I could just go, you know what I mean? Like, if that’s what it’s going to take to f*ck me, I’ll head home. No hard feelings. I don’t want to sound like a prude. Right? I’m not trying to kink shame up here. Tying up’s fun. Even the sleeping, I guess I don’t have a problem with. My issue with that situation is that she has no use of her hands and I’ve never successfully had sex without the guiding vagina hand move. You know that move? Where the girl’s like an electrician trying to connect two wires. Just like a real— I 98% know where a pussy is, but that last 2% I really need help with. Yeah. I’m not that good at rough sex. I think it’s because I love my mom too much. She called me recently and she was like, Hey, how’s your love life going? It’s like, Not great, because of all the support you showed me as a child. Would it have killed you to miss a football practice every once in a while? I have no resentment towards women. I can barely choke this girl, mom. You’re embarrassing me right now. No, I’ll choke you, though. Don’t worry, I will. No problem. It’s not my favorite, but it’s fine. Some people, though, they love it, right? Some people, that’s how they have morning sex. That is crazy to me, right? There’s birds chirping outside. You’re smelling pancakes from next door. You’re just like— Come on, man. There’s a fresh morning dew outside. Children are going to school right now. Let “The Price Is Right” come on first. Show some decorum. Even dirty talk, you know? I feel like you’re doing me a really nice favor having sex with me. I don’t want to say a bunch of rude things to you, right? That’s not how you treat a bud doing a favor, right? Your friend helps you move. You’re not like, Yeah, get that ottoman, you little slut. Just putting my fingers in my friend Jeff’s mouth. Pick up the credenza, Jeffy. [spit sound] You little mover. Here’s another move somebody asked me to pull, was one of these, was just a choke-finger combo. You know, just like a real— Is that is that still sex, you guys? I got to be honest, it didn’t feel like sex. It felt like gynecology in the 1400s, you know? Like I felt like I was punishing a witch more than anything. It felt like we caught her learning how to read. For the crime of female literacy. Little Pilgrim hat. If she’s squirts, she’s a witch. Yeah. I’ve been out there, you know? I’ve been on some sexual voyages, you know? You know, I’ve had to f*ck my way out of a couple jams. Had a couple threesomes, Didn’t all go my way, I’ll be honest with you guys. Anybody here? A threesome? Yeah? How’d it go? —Uh, it went pretty well, I guess. Pretty well, you guess? Alright. Nice. Who were these people? —I got hit up on Tinder like four in the morning. You got hit up on Tinder. By a woman’s account? A man’s account? —Yeah, a woman surprisingly enough. A woman at 4 a.m. Alright, nice. Just out of the blue, they’re like, This is the guy I need. Huh? —She said, Do you want to have a threesome? Wow. —I did not think it was real. Sure. Of course. You’re like, yeah. You’re just like, alright, just check— Make sure my kidney is here the next morning. —It’s like a 30-minute Uber ride. —I was like, this might be it. That is— You weren’t getting too much pussy before, I’m guessing, right? They caught you in a drought. They caught you in a big dry spell. You’re like, I could die. It’s 4 a.m. I have to work in the morning. It’s $75 right now. But by gum, I might just get double sucked, so. And who are these women? What are they looking like when you get in? Do the pictures look similar? Wow. —Yeah. Wow. —It was all pretty cut and dry. All pretty cut and dry. Like you’re f*cking hanging, like you’re doing shingles on their roof. You’re like, Yeah. Wasn’t too much water damage? Everything was looking pretty good. Get in and out job. Alright. So how quickly until you’re in the house, is your penis breathing fresh air, would you say? —Like an hour and a half. Hour and a half? So you warmed up a little bit. That’s nice. —Except they wanted to make sure I wasn’t gonna kill them. —I was like, —Right. Yeah. —I’m the one that took an Uber ride —Sure, sure, sure. —30 minutes away. Wow, it’s a Mexican standoff. Okay. And then after they’ve vetted you for 90 minutes, they’re like, This is good. We can f*ck this guy. Okay. And then, is it good? Did everybody bust? —Just not me. Just not you? What? Get the f*ck out of here. The rare the guy doesn’t come in a two girls, one guy? They gave me a f*ckload of Adderall. They gave you Adderall? What the f*ck is going on? Wow. Respect to these girls. Did they give you dick pills and Adderall? That’s a f*cking dangerous combination. And you don’t bust and you’re just f*cking, you’re driving— You’re taking a f*cking 40-minute Uber home. You’re like— Dick on titanium, just— That was pretty cool. And you know what? That’s a fond memory for you, isn’t it? You’re gonna be on your deathbed just like smiling. Your grandchild is gonna be like, What is it, Papa? And you’re gonna be thinking about not busting to two, I’m gonna guess Maryland five and a halfs. There’s no way— There’s no way these were hot women, right? Everything we know we can kind of through echolocation understand they were ugly. And you’re going to be thinking about not coming with these women. Then you’re gonna look at him and be like, How much I love grandma. That’s— Nice, how about a nice hand for our friend over here, huh? Anybody else? Any other threesomes? This seems like a pretty— Over here. Raising your glass? Is that the I-had-a-threesome salute? How’d it go? —Not too well. Not too well? Yeah. By the way, shouts out a fellow man of',\n",
       "  ' size, getting his dick sucked by two women. Who were these— What was the situation for you? —They looked like you. They looked like me. Alright. I don’t know why the f*ck I have to be disparaged in this. And you’re the one who f*cked them. I look like me. You f*cked two people that looked like me. How am I? How am I getting dragged into this? You couldn’t have said they looked like you? You know what I’m saying? Listen, we’re not too far off, pal. There’s a lot of different ways you could have phrased that that doesn’t throw me under the bus. Okay, so you were having a threesome in your weight class. It sounds like this was more of a wrestling match than a sexual encounter. Where did you meet these people? —Vegas. Vegas. Nice. Okay, so just three people down on their luck, just deciding to try to have a plus-sized threeway. That’s good. That’s good for the community. I like that. How many people came for you? —Only me. Only— Oh there we go. We’ve got the yin and yang of bad threesomes over here. I love it. Yeah. Mine was— Mine was closer to yours than his. But I’ll tell my story now. My threesome did not go good either. It was a surprise, first of all. I didn’t think it was gonna happen. And also, the day of my threesome, it started with a $40 Chinese food order. That was breakfast for me. You know what I mean? Just me, by the way. That’s $40 me. And it was one of those things where I was waiting. It was like, 10:59, 11. Hello? Yes, I’d like to— It’s like ordering Chinese food, like I’m waiting for Star Wars, you know? And so $40 Chinese food breakfast. There’s a real ceiling to your day when that’s how it starts, right? And I was also coming off the heels of a tender bender, which is when you have chicken tenders every day for two weeks in a row. Right? So I’m not where you need to be, nutritionally speaking, for a threesome, right? So I’m actually scrolling on Tinder and she’s gonna come to my show that night, but she’s bringing a friend. So in my mind, I’m like, okay, she’s coming to a public place. She’s bringing a friend, she wants to check out the vibes. And if you know, if the vibes are right, maybe we go on a date next week, just me and her. Maybe we f*ck next week, right? But there’s no sexual pressure on this situation. I just have to be a cute, charming little guy, and I think we all know how that’s gonna go. Right? So we get there and it’s a fun time. You know, the conversation is going really well. Her friend’s cool. She’s cool. And but, you know, like I said, I don’t think I’m gonna f*ck so I’m gonna keep eating, right? Because it’s one or the other, folks. I got a real problem. And so we’re chatting and I’m just f*cking eating like an asshole. I’m eating the way like a cartoon villain eats, you know what I mean? I’m just like, they’re talking just like sliders, like— You know? Just like a fish. The bones come out, like that situation. And it’s going good, but I’m getting sleepy because I’ve had a lot of carbs, right? And I’m about to talk to the girl I match with and be like, Hey, this was fun, let’s hang out some other time. But before I can make that pitch, I look over at them and they’re being really weird. They’re like texting each other. And I’m like, Hey, girls, what’s going on? And they’re like, Oh, nothing. We were thinking like, maybe we should all go back to my place and f*ck. And I was like, Yeah. Yes. Ha ha ha. Duh. That’s what I was also thinking. That’s what I am prepared for right now. But what am I gonna do? What, I’m gonna be like, My tummy hurts. I can’t get pussy. I had too many treats to get pussy tonight. I can’t do that. Right? So I’m like, F*ck it, I’m gonna thug this out. We’ll be fine. So we’re driving back to their place, right? And the whole time I’m doing this thing, I don’t know fellas if you’ve ever done this, where you try and make your dick hard with your mind. Have you ever done that? Just do a little check-in, I’m just in there like, Nothing. No movement whatsoever. Right? But I’m like, no big deal. I’m gonna get in this room. It’s gonna be me and four titties. I’m gonna be good to go. Right? And at first, I’m right. At first it rocks. I’m in there. Just me and four titties. I don’t know if you’ve ever seen— Have you seen one of those videos where they give a baby hearing aids for the first time? You ever, You ever see one of those? I’m just in there like— I’m having the time of my life, brother. It’s going awesome. But then, very quickly, the Chinese food comes back to haunt me, right? I just, I’m hitting them with dumpling dick, you know? Just think of a couple soup dumplings stacked on top of each other, you know? Very wobbly. Like, optically, I’m hard, but there is no structural integrity to my penis whatsoever. Yeah, it’s tough. I’m doing this movie a lot. I’m doing the okay sign. Have you ever done that? Where it’s like, Yeah, no, it’s hard. Uh huh, yeah. No, it’s hard. It’s actually definitely hard. Can you check? Can you check again? My dick is hard for sure. Like my credit card is getting declined. I’m like, Yeah, I called my bank. They said my dick was hard. So can you check? I’m blowing it, dude. I’m stalling for so— I’m eating pussy for so long. You could have just watched all of Rush Hour 2 the amount of time I’m eating pussy. One of them just falls asleep in the middle of it, you know? You know you’re not laying it down when you lose a participant mid-threesome, right? Yeah. I’m like, this is brutal. This is horrific. We got to end this. So I guess what I’m gonna have to do is jack off and leave. And that’s what I did. And in hindsight, it’s crazy that was my plan, right? Why the f*ck did I do that? Like, Oh, hey, girls, I’ve just been sexually disappointing you for two hours in a row. I’m gonna make a small mess in your home and get out of here. If that’s alright with you. And it was an angry one, too. It was one of those get the poison outs. You know? It was like a real, Aaaaah. I want to be free! So I do that and I’m just standing in this f*cking hallway dealing with a devastating bout of post-nut clarity. And I’m like, Wow, this is it. This is a tough L. This is the worst one of my life, probably. But you know what? That’s okay, because we can rebuild from this, right? It’s only up from here. This is rock bottom. So I’m gonna do it. I’m gonna f*cking rebuild my life like the, like the Phoenix, I’ll rise from these sexual ashes. Right? And that’s what I do. Eight months go by, my sh*t’s going great. My life’s going better and better and better. Things are going really good. And then out of the blue, I get a text from these girls and they’re like, Hey, want to f*ck again? And I’m like, This is a prank. Right? Like, I’m gonna get to their apartment. It’s just gonna be all my enemies, you know? Ha ha ha dude, we knew you couldn’t fuck. Ha ha ha. But that wasn’t, it was really them. They wanted to hook up again. And I wasn’t gonna ask too many questions, right? They had a whole little plan. You know, they had the day off from work. They were gonna go to the museum and then come over to my place after, which is a very European afternoon, you know? Like look at paintings and f*ck a fat guy with a little mustache. That’s, that’s Parisian, you know what I mean? And I had a plan too. I wasn’t going out the same way. This is redemption, you know what I mean? I’m f*cking hitting the elliptical. I’m f*cking drinking green juices. I’m drinking kombuchas. I buy $80 worth of illegal Indian Viagra off the Internet. Just from a guy that worked at a research lab. He was like, Yeah, just Venmo me and put “lunch.” Just comes in an unmarked vial. I’m just like, I take so much of it and my dick— it worked. My dick got hard as sh*t. But the rest of my body was failing, you know? Like, I was just f*cking and my joints were locking up. I’m just in there cold sweat, you know? Like the eyesight of my left eye is flickering like a light bulb in a haunted house. And I’m like, This is it. This is how I deserve to die. Is overdosing on dick pills. And if that’s how I went, I wouldn’t even want an open casket, you know? I would want a gloryhole casket, you know? Just everyone coming, paying their last respects, you know? He was such a good boy. Yeah. And so obviously the threesome wasn’t good, but there was one good part in the beginning, and that’s when I was I was eating pussy while getting my dick sucked. And it felt like I was sucking my own dick through a portal and that, that was the best moment of my life, I gotta be honest. Guys, thank you so much. That’s it. We did it. Hell yeah. Thank you.

       " [\"[upbeat music] [sentimental music] [announcer] Please welcome Taylor Tomlinson! [audience cheering] Thank you so much! [cheering] Thank you! Thank you, guys, so much! Thank you! I so, so appreciate you guys being here. It’s been a rough couple of years. I got bangs at one point. Shit got dark. [audience laughs] I didn’t even want bangs. I just needed people to check on me. And it works, by the way. You post a selfie in bangs, everybody’s like, “Fire emoji. You go, girl!” Then they text you, like, “You okay?” [audience laughs] Here’s what I did. I got bangs and then two days later, I did mushrooms for the first time. [audience laughs] And as soon as I did those mushrooms, I was like, “I should’ve done these first. [audience laughs] Probably wouldn’t have gotten these bangs if I forgave myself, huh?” [audience laughs] But you know what? Having bangs feels exactly like being on mushrooms. The whole time, you’re just looking at your friends, like, “Do I look weird? [audience laughs] You guys would tell me if I looked weird, right? Is it… Is it bad different? Is it not good… You know what? I changed my mind. I don’t want to do it. It’s too late? It’s already happening? Okay, no, I can be this person.” I got back into therapy. Anybody in therapy? [audience cheers] Mostly women. That’s the problem. [audience laughs] It’s very hard to stay in therapy. My old therapist told me that when I get close to people, I have a tendency to self-sabotage. And I thought that was bullshit, so I ghosted her. [audience laughs] And then… I finally went back because I finally dated enough people who all gave me the exact same feedback about my shitty personality. You know, that romantic quota you hit where you’re, like, [laughing] “Uh-oh! Might be me! [audience laughs] Oh, the reviews are in and they are [blows raspberry] unanimous. That’s a bummer.” So after a really bad breakup a few years ago, I finally took a long hard look at myself and said, “Okay, Taylor, five out of five dudes all think that in fights, you behave like a raccoon trapped in a trash bag.” [audience laughs] “So maybe it’s time to get some Klonopin or a rabies shot.” [audience laughs] I am fully medicated now. Anybody else? Anti-depressants? [audience cheers] Medication? Yeah. Nice. What are we on? Shout it out. [audience shouting indistinctly] Zoloft, Lexapro. Oh! Look at us. Gang’s all here! [audience laughs] Oh my God! I’m also on something. I would never say what, that’s very personal, but… [audience laughs] No, I’m kidding. I’m on a few things. I am on Klonopin as needed for panic attacks. I’m so glad I have Klonopin now because before I had medication for it, I would have panic attacks right when I had to be somewhere, which is the worst time to get them ’cause then you just have to pinch the panic attack off like a shit you don’t have time to take. [audience laughs] You know what I mean? When you’re, like, “Okay, I got 60% of that out of my system. [audience laughs] I’m not done but I gotta go to work. [audience laughs] I will get to the other 40 later or I’ll finish in the big stall at lunch if no one’s in there. [audience laughs] I got put on something else for sleep because I have night terrors. There’s no fun, casual way to say that. [giggles] “Wake up screaming and…” [audience laughs] These sleeper time pills I got are great. They don’t stop the nightmares but they do hold you down while they’re happening. [audience laughs] Which sounds bad but before, I’d wake up in the middle so afraid and now, I stay asleep until the nightmare’s natural conclusion, [audience laughs] which provides you with some closure. [audience laughs] You’re like, “Oh, he stabs me at the end. [audience gasps] Okay, plot twist, M. Nightmare Shyamalan.” [audience laughs] I thought I was on an anti-depressant. It turns out I’m not. It turns out I’m actually on a mood stabilizer that they use as an anti-depressant. Fun fact about prescription drugs. Everything they prescribe, they actually use for, like, four different things. So you don’t really know what your deal is until you find a combo that works and then Google all your pills by yourself. [audience laughs] So after years of trial and error, I finally found a combination of things that worked for me, and six months ago, I decided to Google it ’cause what the hell. And it turns out that everything I’m taking is primarily used for bipolar disorder. So I went back to my psychiatrist and I was, like, “Hey. [audience laughs] Do we think…?” [audience laughs] And she was, like, “Oh! Yeah!” [audience laughs] And I was, like, “Is this how you fucking tell people?” [audience laughs] And she’s, like, “No, of course not. We didn’t know. I’m glad we figured it out.” And I was, like, “We?” [audience laughs] I said, “You really didn’t know that I was bipolar?” And she goes, “No, of course not. We thought we were treating anxiety and depression.” And I said, “Okay. ‘Cause this kinda feels like a putting your dog’s medication in cheese situation.” [audience laughs] And I was, like, “I don’t know how I feel about this diagnosis.” And she goes, “Well, if it makes you feel better, you don’t have to say, ‘I am bipolar.’ You can say, ‘I have bipolar.'” [audience chuckles] Which feels a lot like someone going, “I said you were being a bitch.” [audience laughs] I’m so glad I know that I’m bipolar now. I mean, I have the right meds, I got a mood ring, I’m handling it. [audience laughs] But when I first found out, it was a very tough pill to swallow. And I’ve swallowed a lot of pills. [audience laughs] Because when you first find out something like that, you’re, like, “Oh man, am I gonna tell anybody? Should I tell anybody? And if I do tell people, am I hot and/or talented enough to be an inspiration?” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] Like, if I have a thing and someone else has that thing and they find out I have it too, are they gonna feel good or bad with that information? Because when I got diagnosed, they started listing names. They were, like, “You know who else is bipolar? Selena Gomez.” And I was, like, “That does make me feel better. [audience laughs] She is very pretty. [audience laughs] Okay, I’ll be bipolar.” [audience laughs] I did not grow up in a household that was very, like, mental health-conscious. Like, we were very religious. I don’t know if you’ve ever tried to tell your conservative dad that you have a mental health issue. It doesn’t go great. When I was in high school, I was like, “Dad, I think I’m depressed.” And he was, like, “You just need some protein. Get a scoop of peanut butter.” [audience laughs] Yeah, there’s a lot of dads out there just white-knuckling it through life right now, clinging to a jar of chunky Jif like it’s the answer, just a buoy in the storm. “It’ll pass!” [audience laughs] The only mental health advice my dad ever gave me is I was having panic attacks in high school and I didn’t know what they were and I was very stressed out. And I was, like, “I don’t know what to do. I don’t know what to do when I feel like this. I don’t know what to do.” And he goes, “Alright. All I can tell you is that when you feel like this, get as far away from the people you care about as possible… [audience laughs] …until you feel different.” Which is advice you give a werewolf, like… [audience laughs] “Just run into the woods ’til you’re not a monster anymore. Don’t let them see you change. They won’t accept you for what you truly are.” [audience laughs] And I had friends who scared me too when I was trying to get on medication. They were, like, “Ugh, I tried. I tried anti-depressants. I didn’t like how I felt on them. I didn’t feel like myself.” And now that I’m on them, I’m, like, “Yeah, me neither! It’s the best.” [audience laughs] Okay? And I do feel like myself. I just feel like now someone’s sitting on me going, “Shh! [audience laughs] Stop talking. You will ruin everything. We are… We are trying to help you. You’d be married right now if you just shut the hell up. [audience laughs] Remember that? Yeah, us too. We are trying to help you. Go to sleep. Choose a different adventure.” [audience laughs] And they warn you about the side effects when you get on medication. They go, “You know, your sex drive might go down.” And I’ll be honest, I have experienced that since I got on medication, but I can’t tell if my sex drive is lower or if my self-esteem is just higher now. [audience laughs] You know? [audience claps, cheers] It’s, like, am I not in the mood, or do I just not need the validation? Which is it? Because depression will bring you to your knees and you’re, like, “While I’m down here, might as well make someone feel good. I… do not want to waste a trip.” [audience whoops] If you’re not laughing, congrats on your serotonin. [audience laughs] And if you’re, like, “What’s serotonin?” Don’t worry. You have enough. [audience laughs] I wasn’t sure if I was gonna talk about it on stage, and then I needed new material and I was, like, “Fire sale! Everything goes.” [audience laughs] No, truthfully, I was surprised that I felt so bad about it ’cause I think I’m pretty open-minded. And I don’t think anybody should feel bad if they get diagnosed with a mental illness ’cause it’s just information about you that helps you know how to take better care of yourself. [audience cheers] Yeah. Being bipolar, there’s nothing wrong with it. Being bipolar is like not knowing how to swim. It might be embarrassing to tell people and it might be hard to take you certain places. [audience laughs] [audience continues laughing] But they have arm floaties. [audience laughs] And if you just take your arm floaties, you can go wherever the hell you want. [audience laughs] And… I know some of you are, like, “But Taylor, what if people judge me for taking arm floaties?” Well, those people don’t care if you live or die, so maybe who cares? [audience whoops] Maybe fuck those people a little. [audience cheers] I don’t know. That being said, you have to take your arm floaties [audience laughs] because it’s not cool to know you can’t swim, go to the public pool anyway, and jump into the deep end, making it everyone else’s problem. [audience laughs] And you thrash around going, “I’m good!” They’re like, “You’re literally drowning.” And then someone nice and handsome jumps in to help you. And you’re, like, “See? I’m fine. I can totally swim.” And they’re, like, “No, you’re holding him underwater. [audience laughs] You turned Kevin into an arm floaty [audience laughs] and that’s not a fair relationship for Kevin.” [audience laughs] Then someone floats by you on their back and you’re, like, “What was that?” And they’re, like, “Oh, that’s someone whose parents supported them in the pool… [audience laughs] …until they could be trusted not to die. [audience laughs] Here are your arm floaties.” [audience laughs] I was very nervous to tell friends of mine I was bipolar because I thought they would think of me differently. And then I told all my friends and nobody did and it was actually pretty insulting. [audience laughs] Because I’ve had friends tell me they were bipolar and I was, like, “What? You? You’re kidding.” And then I told my friends and they were, like, “That checks out. That’s… [audience laughs] That connects a lot of dots for us.” I told Dustin, one of my best friends in the whole world, and he goes, “Yeah, your mental illness was kinda like your middle name. I didn’\",\n",
       "  \"t know what it was but I knew that you had one.” [audience laughs] It’s really good. That was not the feedback I kept getting from romantic partners, by the way. [audience laughs] That’s not what finally made me get help. Every guy I’ve ever dated has told me I have trust issues, which is something liars say when you’re on to them. [audience laughs] [in deep voice] “You have trust issues, babe.” You have a hot co-worker and a locked phone, so… [audience laughs] I have trust issues but I earned them, okay? [audience laughs] I absolutely earned them, like, I got cheated on in college. My college boyfriend was sleeping with sex workers behind my back, or prostitutes if you’re old and don’t know that word’s not okay to use anymore. Sometimes older crowd members could get confused ’cause they’re, like, “What is a sex worker?” “Is that what my granddaughter does on Instagram?” [audience laughs] And you’re, like, “No, no, no, she’s just hot. That’s a FabFitFun box.” “That’s a different…” [audience laughs] “That’s a different thing.” [audience laughs] “Your granddaughter doesn’t… That’s not a job.” “That’s not real.” [audience laughs] You can’t say prostitute anymore. Calling a sex worker a prostitute is like calling a comedian a clown. You’re not technically wrong but you are a fucking asshole, so… [audience laughs] But I told my therapist I got cheated on like this and she didn’t say what I wanted her to say, which was, “Poor baby, sweetie, this session is free.” [audience laughs] Instead, she goes, “Well, you might be a self-fulfilling prophecy.” And I was like, “Oh!” And she’s like, “No, it’s a bad thing.” And I was like, [audience laughs] “Well, then could you say I have self-fulfilling prophecy? [audience laughs] Is Selena Gomez a self-fulfilling prophecy?” [audience laughs] And I said, “What does that mean, I’m a self-fulfilling prophecy?” And she goes, “Well, sometimes we expect someone to treat us poorly, so we treat them like they’re going to treat us poorly until they do.” “You thought someone was gonna cheat on you, so you treated them like they were gonna cheat on you until they did cheat on you, and then you were like, ‘See?'” [audience chuckles] And I was like, “Oh.” [audience laughs] “So I’m a witch.” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] And she’s like, “Oh! So close. You’re a bitch.” “You gotta…” [audience laughs] I’m like, “Whatever. All I heard was Gryffindor!” [audience laughs] I am working on my trust issues. I was so much worse when I first started seeing my therapist. I told her like first session, I was like, “The guy I’m dating keeps answering my phone calls, ‘Hey, beautiful?'” [audience laughs] And she’s like, “So, what’s the problem?” I was like, “I mean, I don’t know yet.” [audience laughs] “But when I find out who ‘Beautiful’ is…” [audience laughs] She’s like, “Do you think it might be you?” I was like, “I’m sorry. I thought we were here to work.” [audience laughs] I think I’m cute or whatever now, but I was an ugly kid with honest parents, and that shit stays in your bones, alright? If you were an ugly kid with honest parents, I don’t care how attractive you grow up to be, at any point, if someone’s like, “You look really nice today,” you’re like, “Yeah, whatever. I know the Goddamn truth.” [audience laughs] When I was ten, I said, “Dad, am I pretty?” And his response was, “Look.” [audience laughs] “I’m not the best looking guy, right?” “No, but I wake up every morning and I try.” [audience laughs] “I…” “I take a shower, I put on a nice suit, and I do okay!” [audience whoops] And then he went to work. [audience laughs] And I became a comedian, I guess. [audience laughs] That was his response to his ten-year-old daughter. Just like, “You and me, potato face, these were the cards we were dealt.” “Get clean and match.” “That’s all you can do. Don’t sleep on wet hair. Can’t do that.” “Maybe wear a hat sometimes. Cover up some of that head.” “I’m sorry there’s so much of it.” [audience laughs] I think I’m pretty. I have a big head. I know I do ’cause every guy I’ve ever dated has made a point to be like, “I love your big head.” [audience laughs] That’s my favorite thing guys do when they compliment the thing you hate most about yourself, they’re like, “I love your soft arms.” You’re like, “Okay. [audience laughs] Yeah? I love your weird balls. How does it feel? [audience laughs] [audience cheers] How does it feel to be accepted?” [audience chuckles] I’m a nightmare to date. [audience laughs] Anything nice you do or say, I’m just like, “Whatever.” I dated a guy once who told me that flirting with me was like punching water. [audience laughs] And I was like, “Why? ‘Cause it’s pointless or ’cause you look stupid doing it?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “Did you hear it?” I’m like, “I heard it that time. Yeah.” [audience laughs] And then he cheated on me, so, you know, prophecy fulfilled! [audience laughs] I can’t help it. At the beginning of a relationship with a guy, I just assume anything nice he does is he a move he pulls on everybody and I’m not gonna fall for your choreography, sir. [audience laughs] I’m like, “Oh, is this… is this your move? You open the car door for me on the date? [woman laughs] Is this like your move? [chuckles] This is how you do it? That’s cute. Bet that works a lot.” [audience laughs] “Oh, is this… is this your move? You go with me to my grandpa’s funeral, hold an umbrella over my head in the rain? [audience laughs] Is this like… Is this like your move? This is how you do it? [audience laughs] Like, ‘Whoops, don’t get wet.’ ‘Oops! I am.’ Whatever. [audience laughs, cheers] This ain’t my first rodeo. I used to have two grandpas.” [audience laughs] [audience chuckles] “Oh, is this… Is this your move? [audience chuckles] You die next to me in a hospital bed at 86 years old holding my hand for all eternity? Is this like your move? This is how you get pussy?” [audience laughs] He’s like, “We’ve been together for 60 years.” I’m like, “You’re a fuckboy and I know it! [audience laughs] Don’t bury me with this guy. He’s been dying with other people behind my back. [audience laughs] I can’t prove it. Check his phone when he uses the bedpan.” [audience laughs] And that’s why we’re in therapy. [audience laughs] People are scared to go to therapy because they think it’s someone sitting in a chair going, “You suck.” But it’s not. It’s you in a chair going, “I suck.” [audience laughs] And then your therapist is like, “That’s great. Let’s start there.” [audience laughs] Therapy just helps you to get to the bottom of why you’re trash, okay? You go into therapy and you’re like, “Here’s all the stuff that sucks about me.” And she goes, “Okay.” And she puts it all up on the wall like you’re solving a crime together. Fun! [audience laughs] And then she gets some of that red string that detectives use at home when they’ve been thrown off the case for going rogue [audience laughs] and she starts connecting each crappy thing about you to each one of your corresponding childhood traumas, and you’re like, “Oh my God! That’s why I’m like this.” And she’s like, “That’s why you’re like this.” And you’re like, “Am I fixed now?” And she’s like, “God, no! [audience laughs] No, no, no.” You’re like, “Well, what do I do now?” She’s like, “Well, you keep coming back in here every week with your credit card.” And you’re like, “What? Will I ever be fixed?” She’s like, “I don’t know. Bring your credit card!” [audience laughs] I’ve got to the bottom of a lot of stuff in therapy. I’m an emotional eater. I don’t know if anybody else identifies with that. [audience whoops] Cool. Seven people. Everyone else is like, “No, we just eat until we’re almost full and then we thank God for the opportunity, okay.” [audience laughs] “Food is just fuel for me.” If you’re one of those, fuck right off, for real. [audience laughs] I’ll refund your money. I don’t need your support. [audience cheers] I’m doing fine. If you don’t know what an emotional eater is, it just means you like eat to cope with uncomfortable feelings. So if I’m like sad or anxious or awake, I like to be eating to take the edge off. [audience laughs] If you still don’t know if that’s you, you can ask yourself a few questions to find out. Number one. When you eat nachos in public, do you get kinda mad that other people are there to see it? [audience laughs] Do you feel like nachos should come with a privacy curtain? I do. [audience laughs] Have all the best meals of your life taken place in your own car around 11 p.m.? [audience laughs] Under a flickering streetlamp? Have you ever eaten a brownie while you felt okay [audience laughs] and wished you were sad… [audience laughs] …so that it tasted better? [audience laughs] Sounds like more than seven of us. [audience laughs] In therapy, I figured out the day in my childhood I became an emotional eater. I was eight years old and I was eating a bagel in the kitchen and my dad came in and he goes, “You’re gonna want to put that bagel down. I gotta tell you something.” And that’s when he told me that my mom had died. So somewhere in my brain, something clicked, like, “Oh, when you stop eating bread, [audience laughs] people perish.” [audience laughs] I went back to fourth grade like the angel of death. Everyone’s like, “Step on a crack, break your mother’s back.” I’m like, “Stop eating bread, now your mom’s dead, dude. [audience laughs] They left out that second part but…” I had a lisp when I was eight. I tell you guys that because no one told me. [audience laughs] They pulled me aside a year later at school. Someone’s like, “Taylor, your teacher thinks you might be struggling with a speech impediment.” I’m like, [with lisp] “What’s a speech impediment? [audience laughs] [with lisp] Are you sure you have the right person, ’cause… I’m crushing it out there.” [audience laughs] And they’re like, “You didn’t do anything wrong. You just pronounce your words a little differently, like you say “sh” instead of “ss” for your S’s, does that make sense? And I was like, [with lisp] “I’m pretty sure I would have noticed [audience laughs] if I said ‘sh’ instead of ‘sh’. Hope you find who you’re looking for. [audience laughs] If you have any follow-up questions, I’ll be on the see-saw.” [audience laughs] I know dead mom jokes make people uncomfortable. I know that and if you are uncomfortable, I don’t know what to say, you should’ve worked harder so it was you up here. [audience laughs, cheers] No, honestly, I never want to make people feel uncomfortable with that information. So much so that I used to lie to everybody. Growing up, I used to tell everybody that my parents were separated so I wouldn’t have to say my mom’s dead. And that worked very well until recently a friend of mine found out I had lied and she was very upset. [audience laughs] She was like, “Your mom’s dead? Taylor, you told me your parents were separated.” And I was like, “Well, they were! [audience laughs] By Jesus.” [audience laughs] Both her parents are alive, so she has no idea how funny that is but… [audience laughs] She’ll get it eventually, right? Like that joke is a slow burn. [audience laughs] Kinda like cancer, which is what got mine, hey oh! [audience laughs] Okay, alright. [audience laughs] [groans] Here’s the deal, Boston. [audience laughs] We have another, like, six minutes of dead mom jokes. [audience laughs] I know. You’re getting like, “Whoa, no, six minu\",\n",
       "  'tes is a long time.” It won’t feel long. I have cushioned her, alright? [audience laughs] I have laid my dead mom to rest in a beautiful casket of dick jokes and pop culture references. There’s something for everybody over the next six minutes. You’ll laugh, you’ll cry, you’ll forget she’s dead. [audience laughs] But I know a lot’s happening for you as a crowd right now because you’re like, “Taylor, we’re good people. Good people wouldn’t laugh at dead mom jokes.” I’m here to tell you that if you’re trying to be a good person at a comedy show, you’re wasting your God damn time. [audience laughs] Trying to be a good person at a comedy show is like trying to recycle at a theme park. You’re already in here and part of the problem, put your hands up and have fun. [audience laughs] And I know you’re good people. You’re like, “Taylor, we’ve known you for 25 minutes. We hate that anything bad ever happened to you even once.” Thank you so much, Boston. But what you have to understand is the bad thing already happened and now I’m talking about it into a microphone in front of people who paid to be here, [audience laughs] which means now the bad thing is money. [audience laughs] Do you think I’d be this successful at my age if I had a live mom? [audience laughs] [audience whoops] [shouts] Fuck no! [audience laughs] I’d be a creative writing teacher who loved myself and I’d be sitting in the dark with you pheasants, okay? [audience laughs] She’s in heaven, I’m on Netflix, it all worked out. [audience cheers] That is a real thing I said in therapy. [audience laughs] To which my therapist responded, “You should come in twice this week.” [audience laughs] Some people get sad because I was eight when it happened. But eight is a great time to lose a parent because you’re so stupid, you barely know what’s going on. When I was eight, I was like, the only people I know with dead moms are Disney princesses. [audience chuckles] So like, this sucks but am I about to get hot? [audience laughs] Then I hit puberty and I was like, “Oh no, I guess God just hates me right now, that’s a bummer.” That’s a joke. God doesn’t hate anybody, alright? Not anymore. [audience laughs] But have you read the Old Testament? Holy shit. [audience laughs] The Old Testament is my favorite Taylor Swift album. It is… [audience laughs] It is banger after banger. Just like, “You don’t believe in me? [in singsong voice] Snakes! Look what you made me do.” [audience laughs] I’m a 20-something white woman, obviously, I’m gonna compare T. Swift to the Lord, alright? [audience laughs] She is the only god I still believe in, alright? [audience cheers] I don’t see God God revamping his old shit and let’s be honest, he probably should ’cause the people who own it now suck. [audience laughs, cheers] It does grow you up very quickly, losing a parent that young. I mean, I saw a dead body when I was eight which means I saw a dead body years before I saw a dick. And that is not the order that shit should go in [audience laughs] according to the American Girl Body book. [audience laughs] Although maybe it should be ’cause you know what’s crazy? A dick? Way more traumatizing than your dead mom. [audience laughs] Oh my God, it’s so much worse. I saw my mom, I was like, “That lady used to make me snacks, now she’s very still.” I saw a dick for the first time, I was like, “Oh my God! Who took Jabba the Hutt’s eyes? [audience laughs] You have done nothing for me. No, no, no. No, I didn’t say Beetlejuice even one time!” [audience laughs] I haven’t seen that many dicks and I don’t want to see any more and it’s nothing against men, I’m attracted to you for some reason but I swear to God, every time you see a new dick, there is an adjustment period, isn’t there? [audience laughs] Just a real quick like… [huffs deeply] and we’re back in it, alright. [audience laughs] I have stayed in relationships too long ’cause I just wasn’t ready to see a fresh one. I just couldn’t [audience laughs] couldn’t wrap my head around it, literally or figuratively. I just… I just didn’t have it in me, couldn’t have it in me. And… [audience laughs] I don’t care how many dicks you’ve seen, every time you see a new dick, it feels like jumping into a cold pool. Just like, [nervously] “Alright, let me just swim around, get used to this one.” “Okay, alright, this one’s deeper than the last one but that’s okay.” “That’s alright. This is why we take our arm floaties, you know, for moments like these.” [audience claps, cheers] [grunting] Just control your breathing, hot girl summer, bitch, you can do it. [audience laughs] I think of the genitalia options available, I think dick seem friendlier, you know. They’re up, they’re happy to see you, they’re wagging, I’ve never had sex. [audience laughs] It’s like a front tail, right? [audience laughs] I’ll Google it, it’s fine. It’s all speculation. I’ve never seen a vagina, not even my own, I’m a Christian. [audience laughs] But from what I hear, it is very spooky down there. It’s just a dark spooky hole, like, a hole? I’m sorry, what? Every time someone fingers me, I’m like, “You are very trusting, sir, because…” [audience laughs] “…I don’t even know where that goes.” “That might be where I keep the bipolar. That might be…” [audience laughs] “…where it has been… actually, if you see any, could you scrape it out?” “Could you…” [audience laughs] “…just like a mental health Pap smear?” “Can you just do…” [audience laughs] Don’t do that. Like, you gotta hook your finger, like when a baby’s choking, are you familiar? If you do that, it’ll push it in too far, it’s too late. But if you hook your finger, you swipe it, that’s how you get it out. [audience laughs] I like doing that joke because it goes too far but you do learn something that could save a life. [audience laughs] I just love the idea of years from now, someone being like, “If it weren’t for that dick joke, my niece would not be here.” [audience laughs] The craziest thing that happened is my mom died of cancer. See? You almost forgot. [audience laughs] And then my dad got remarried and then our stepmom got cancer. She’s fine, don’t worry. I wouldn’t do that to you twice. [audience laughs] That’s God talking to my dad. And… As soon as our stepmom got it, me and my siblings were like, “Holy shit.” “Is Dad giving people cancer?” [audience laughs] We thought he was a carcinogen. We were like, “Don’t microwave anything for him.” [audience laughs] “I think that’s how he’s doing it.” If he had taken down a second one, we would’ve put a warning on his Christian Mingle account. Like bare minimum, just like, “Hey, chemicals in here have been known to cause cancer.” “Ride at your own risk.” [audience laughs] I feel like some people don’t believe me that she’s alive. She’s completely fine, you guys. She’s happy, healthy, great lady. We actually call my stepmom Mom because when my dad married her, nobody was using it. So we were like, “Yeah, be Mom, who cares.” [audience laughs] Oh, I’m sorry, if your principal quit and you got a new principal, they wouldn’t be like, “This is Lisa.” Like… [audience laughs] Let her be principal, there is an opening. [audience laughs] Also, we were so young when it happened and my dad got remarried so fast, I think he was kinda hoping he could just like Indiana Jones switch them out [audience laughs] before anybody noticed. You know when you’re a kid and your hamster dies and your parents don’t want to explain death to you so they just buy you a new one that looks the same and they’re like, “No, that’s Connie, she just bites now.” [audience laughs] That’s kinda what he did. But with moms. But I never used to talk about any of that, I never used to talk about my mom dying because I didn’t want to make people uncomfortable and also, like most of us with childhood trauma, should be pretty much everyone in here. If you’re sitting here tonight going, “I don’t think I have any, I have great parents, I had a good childhood and this ‘comedy show’? It’s not that fun for me.” [audience laughs] Good. [audience laughs] I hope this is the worst night of your whole life. [audience laughs] ‘Cause it sounds like it’s been smooth sailing [audience laughs] and you might need some perspective. Most of us did have some childhood trauma and when you get to be an adult, you’re like, “Woo, made it! Never have to think about that again. Look at all my keys. The world’s my oyster.” [audience laughs] And so you just start pushing all that dark stuff that happened to you as a kid down, down, down ’til you don’t even think about it anymore. And that works for a long time. [audience chuckles] Until one day, [audience laughs] you stub your toe really hard on a curb and you just start weeping uncontrollably in the street and you’re like, “Okay, this is about something else. [audience laughs] I was keeping all my trauma in that toe. [audience laughs] And then I jostled it and now it’s everywhere. [audience laughs] [whispering] Gone over here.” [audience laughs] And if you don’t deal with that stuff, it’s gonna keep affecting you in ways you are not even conscious of. I realized in therapy that because my mom died young, I have this irrational belief that I am also going to die young, so I’ve been living in a very intense unhealthy way my entire adult life where I’m like, I can’t take a break, I gotta be working all the time, I have to hit these goals and achievements, otherwise I’m nothing. I got engaged a few years ago ’cause I was like, “I gotta get married before I’m dead” which is a super hot way to propose to somebody. [audience laughs] I call it “The Walk to Remember,” it’s kinda my move and… [audience claps] It did not work out with my ex-fiancé. I hate that I have to say that word now. It sounds like a spell, doesn’t it? [shouting] Just like, “Ex-fiancé!” It’s terrible. [audience laughs] He and I are not friends, not ’cause he’s a bad person, he’s actually a very good person. I don’t know if you’ve dated someone right before they find out they’re bipolar but it is what is known as “The Lord’s work.” [audience laughs] I think I was a great partner if nothing went wrong. If nothing went wrong, I was like, awesome. But if one thing went wrong, total nightmare. Like, I was like those spikes you drive over when you’re returning a rental car. Like as long as you keep moving forward, everything’s great. But if you back up even a little, I will slash all your tires. [audience laughs] And then be like, “What? I put up a sign.” [audience laughs] And you’re like, “I know, I mean, I know I messed up a little but like this reaction seems cra… like other speed bumps don’t react like that.” And I’m like, “Then go be with her!” [audience laughs] [chuckles] We are not friends, my ex-fiancé and I, because I think it’s weird when exes try to be friends with each other and they’re like, “We’ll hang out, we’ll get fro yo.” You’re like, “Fro yo? I know what you taste like. I’m not gonna sample yogurt with you, [audience laughs] you psycho. Do they have Kevin after a run, do they have that flavor at Yogurtland?” They do, it’s salted caramel, but still. [audience cheers, claps] I went back home after I called off my engagement for whatever holiday doesn’t offend you and… [audience laughs] …a lot of my friends are settling down. Some of them are just settling, period, end of sentence. [audience laughs] You guys know those couples? Everyone knows one couple like th',\n",
       "  'at where like one person in the couple is way hotter and cooler than the other person in the couple. I like to call those couples chocolate-covered raisins. [audience laughs] Because you’re like sure, you could put those two together, if you want. [audience laughs] But every time you see them, you’re like, “Chocolate, what are you doing? [audience laughs] You could’ve been with anybody. You could’ve been with caramel, you could’ve been with marshmallow, you could’ve been with peanut butter, who I heard cures depression, [audience laughs] and you want to be with raisin forever? Like, no offense, raisin, you’re great, we love you, nature’s candy, that’s you. But you belong with like oatmeal, like, you know that, right? This doesn’t feel good, right? Aren’t you scared every day that someone’s gonna come along and suck chocolate right off of you? [audience laughs] I love this joke ’cause I like to see couples in the audience looking at each other like, “Am I chocolate or raisin? [audience laughs] We’re both chocolate, right, babe? We’re chocolate-covered chocolate? We’re like those little Lindor guys in the foil, you know? I’m the creamy part and you’re the shell [sobbing] ’cause you’re so strong and if you leave me, I’ll be a mess.” [audience laughs] Some of you are like, “I am oatmeal and I am good with it.” [audience laughs] I made the mistake of talking to my happiest married friend after I called off my engagement, don’t do that. Your happiest married friend doesn’t remember what it’s like to be heartbroken. She’s like, “Well, what are you gonna do now? You’re gonna get back out there? Are you seeing anybody?” And I was like, “Nope, just gonna focus on my career for a little bit.” And she’s like, “Well, why can’t you focus on a career and a relationship at the same time?” And I was like, “How do I explain this [audience chuckles] in a way you might understand? [muttering] Why can’t I focus on a career and a relationship? Have you ever been on the freeway in traffic and your lane stops but the one next to you keeps moving, so you get in the one that’s moving, and as soon as you get in the one that’s moving, that one stops and the one next to you starts moving again. So you get back in that first one ’cause that one’s moving now and as soon as you get back in that first one, that one stops again and the one next to you starts moving. And after you go back and forth a few more times, at a certain point, you’re like, “Okay. Is it fucking me?” [audience laughs] And she’s like, “Yeah, I don’t know if I get it because you know, John and I, we usually just boop, get in the carpool lane. [audience laughs] And I was like, “Where’s your baby? Imma drop it!” [audience laughs] I actually did get into a new relationship pretty quickly after I called off my engagement. I wasn’t trying to, I really wasn’t. A lot of my friends were like, “You should stay single for a while. You should maybe get a cat.” And I was like, hard pass. I have never left an interaction with a cat feeling better about who I was. [audience laughs] Every cat reacts to people the way I react to seeing girls I went to middle school with in a Target. Just like… [audience laughs] [shouts] Oh, no! Like that’s every cat. [audience laughs] I don’t want to come home to that energy. [audience laughs] But I wasn’t looking for a relationship. I was trying to have like a fun, sexy fling which doesn’t usually go great for me because I have this round wholesome face that people think they should build a life with. [audience laughs] Every time I’m like, “We could bone or whatever.” Guys are like, “No, I’m alright but you could meet my mom, do you want to do that? You seem like you’d be better at meeting my mom than having sex.” And they are not wrong, alright? [audience laughs] I will meet your mom all night long. Moms like me so much for no reason. I was dating a guy years ago, we were totally on the rocks having problems, and I went to lunch with his mom hoping to get some advice, and halfway through lunch, she puts her hand on my hand and goes, “You know, Taylor, my son’s a lot like his father. [audience chuckles] And if I could go back in time, [audience laughs] I don’t know that I’d marry his father again.” [audience laughs] And I was like, “Are you saving my life in this Panera Bread right now?” [audience laughs] It was like a movie when an older character sacrifices themselves for the good of the journey, like she Gandalfed me. She was like, “Fly, you fool!” [audience laughs] She was a bad mom and a bad wife but such a good friend, oh my God! Hoes before sons, am I right? [audience laughs] I think about her every day. And my boyfriend wasn’t looking for a relationship either when we met, straight dudes usually aren’t, you know. Women are surprised when they find a guy who can make them cum and straight dudes are surprised when they find a girl who can make them feel genuine feelings in their heart. Like women are like, “He got me off three times.” And guys are like, [in low voice] “I mean, I just fucking like her, dude. [audience laughs] [in low voice] Like we talked all day, I didn’t want to hit her, it was nuts! [audience laughs] She’s just like my friend. I don’t know, I want to like lick her heart, I think.” [audience laughs] Straight dudes are so proud of themselves for falling in love. It’s really cute. They’re like, [in low voice] “I love you. Hell yeah, buddy, I knew you could get there.” [audience laughs] Women fall in love, we’re like, “I love you. [whispering] Fucking again? You dumb bitch. [audience laughs] You were supposed to love you first, you keep skipping that part! [audience laughs] It is eat, pray, then love! [audience laughs] Oh my God. It’s okay, we’ll try again in a year and a half.” [audience laughs] My boyfriend is seven years older than me ’cause I needed to get back on my dad for some stuff. [audience laughs] Older guys are just better. They’re just better, you never have to ask them to buy Pepto Bismol, they just have it in the house. [audience laughs] They pull it out after dinner like a nightcap, like, “You want some pink juice, baby girl?” You’re like, “Yes, I would, cheers.” [audience laughs] Older guys don’t call you things like “cute” or “hot.” They call you things like “stunning, gorgeous,” shit with syllables, things that would take a 20-something guy a little while to settle down. [audience laughs] And older guys aren’t like, cute or hot either. You know, they’re handsome, distinguished, like old pictures of your grandpa you shouldn’t look at too long. [audience laughs] You ever find one of those in an old dusty box? You’re like, “Who is that? Oh, that’s wrong. Okay.” [audience laughs] They’re not your family in those pictures yet. They’re just the past, it is a gray area. [audience laughs] Oh, I’ll get weirder. You ever see a picture of your parents when they were young and hot? And you get like weirdly mad ’cause you know they would’ve never dated you? [audience laughs] I saw a picture of my dad in college football once. I didn’t talk to him for three weeks. I’m like, “You would’ve left me at a drive-in, you Danny Zuko piece of shit!” [audience laughs] He’s like, “What?” I’m like, “I can’t hug you for a year and I don’t want to talk about it.” [audience laughs] It’s always awkward getting into a new relationship, though, especially right after you called off an engagement because you don’t feel like you can say any cheesy romantic crap ever again. Even if you feel it, you just feel like you’re a jinx. So when the next person is like, “I wanna be with you forever.” You’re like, “Oh, wouldn’t that be something? [audience laughs] I can’t… I can’t use the F-word anymore but I just need to build my credit back up but… [audience laughs] …samesies, bro, for sure.” New relationships are awkward ’cause you gotta tell a whole new person what you like in bed and the only reason you know what you like in bed is ’cause someone else did it to you first. [audience laughs] But you can’t say it like that, right? You gotta do that cute little tap dance of like, “Oh, babe, you know what would be so fun that’s never even occurred to me before?” “You know what your body is inspiring me to do right now?” But in your head, you’re just like, “Do it like Craig. Could you just…” [audience laughs] “Do it how Craig did it every time?” “Craig didn’t do shit right, he did that right, let me tell you.” “Can we just call him?” “Can we just call him and ask?” [audience laughs] “It’s not a big deal, we’re all adults here.” “Remember we reset the Wi-Fi router last month?” “It’s just like that, babe. He’s just a voice on the phone with the password.” [audience laughs] “That’s all he is to me now.” “No, I did block his number when you asked me to, of course I did.” “But when you block a number, your phone kinda just saves it in a different folder.” [audience laughs] Oh, some of us are gonna fight in the car, not everybody knew that. [audience laughs] You have to be able to talk about what you like in bed and you have to know what you can and can’t say, alright? Like I’ve been telling guys for years I like it a little rougher in bed. I don’t say it like that, I say like, “Oh, I’m damaged,” you know. [audience laughs] If you’re a straight guy, don’t say that. If a straight dude’s like, [in low voice] “I’m damaged,” fucking run! That guy… that guy wants your toes in a baggy. So… [audience laughs] Sometimes you think you like something and you don’t. I thought I like dirty talk, turns out, I just like dirty phrases we agreed upon earlier. [audience laughs] You ever tell someone you like dirty talk and then they hit you with something in bed and you’re like, “Nah, that was not approved by corporate, no.” [audience laughs] I was having sex with a guy once, I was on top and he just went, [shouting] “Look at you!” [audience laughs] [audience laughs, cheers] Like I was taking my first steps. [audience laughs] I’m like, “You better get the camcorder, daddy, ’cause I am never getting up here again.” [audience laughs] My parents don’t watch me do stand-up anymore, don’t worry. [audience laughs] Don’t worry, they’re not interested. No Christian parents want to watch their daughter talk about depression and dick for an hour. It’s not fun for them. [audience laughs] My parents don’t have a dark sense of humor and I do, and I’m glad I do because if you can laugh at the darkest stuff that’s ever happened to you while it’s still actively happening to you, sometimes that’s what gets you through it. For example, here’s a joke they will not like. [audience laughs] Did you guys know that sometimes when you call a suicide hotline and the call drops, they do not call you back? [audience laughs] Yeah, you think that’d be the time for star 69 but sometimes they just ring a bell in the cubicle, like, “Lost another one, that’s lunch!” [audience laughs] Some of you are tensing up like, “Did that really happen?” Yeah, a few years ago and it was fucking hilarious. I was on the floor of a DoubleTree Hotel, like, “Did this bitch just ghost me while I’m trying to ghost myself?” “That is…” [audience laughs] “I mean, I’ve been left on read, I’ve never been left for dead.” “That’s a new one.” [audience laughs] “That is brutal.” I wasn’t even mad. For all I know, that’s how they train those volunteers. Like, “Hey, some nights, we get too many calls. [audience laughs] Fridays are big for us, in those situations, you’',\n",
       "  \"re just gonna have to use your best judgment, alright? Like I usually wait for like a privileged white girl name, like a Chelsea, a Kelsey, a Taylor. Those are the salmon I throw back and hope they swim upstream on their own.” [audience laughs] Even if I was mad, what am I gonna do, hop on Yelp? Like, “One star, totally killed myself. [audience laughs] You’re gonna wish I killed myself after this review.” [audience laughs] I did that joke in Texas a few weeks ago and there was a girl, white, my age in the crowd who goes, [shouting] “And the wait times are ridiculous!” [audience laughs] And she’s right, okay? I think, personally, I think if you are a frequent caller, there should be some sort of rewards program. You know, like when you show loyalty to an airline. Like, you should be able to do that with suicide hotlines where you call in and they’re like, [in robotic voice] “Please enter your rewards number.” Boop, boop, boop. “Welcome back… [sobbing] Taylor. [audience laughs] Thank you for your diamond medallion status. You are now third in line. Would you like to use an upgrade and kick someone else out? [audience laughs] My parents are still very, very religious. My dad was so religious growing up, he used to insist on praying out loud in restaurants before we ate dinner, which is fine if you’re into that but keep it short. [audience laughs] He wouldn’t do that. He would do long, drawn-out prayers full of personal details that none of us signed off on at the table which made puberty pretty rough with your dad in public just like, “Thank you Lord for this food. Thank you for bringing us here together. [shouting] Thank you that Taylor’s a woman now and is getting the help she needs in math.” I’m like, “Can you not tell this Chipotle that I’m bleeding and can’t subtract? [audience laughs] I think God knows.” It’s why I don’t feel bad telling jokes about my parents on stage now ’cause anytime they’re like, “Do you have to air our dirty laundry in front of strangers?” I’m like, “Hometown Buffet, 1998. [audience laughs] You told everyone within a five-booth radius that I shat my pants the night before. [audience laughs] I can say whatever I want. [audience laughs] I’m not religious anymore. I have had some friends find religion as adults recently which is very upsetting. [inhales deeply] [audience laughs] If you grew up religious and you’re not anymore and your adult friends find religion, it feels like God is your shitty ex-boyfriend who’s now getting it together for your friend and you just have to watch it happen on Facebook. They’re like, “Have you met God? He’s amazing.” I’m like, “Yeah, I grew up with God, he’s a douchebag, alright? Did he tell you you were broken and you need him? That’s his move. That’s what he does. [audience laughs] He says that to everybody. Don’t drink what he gives you. You drink that, the next thing you know, you’re eating his body, the holy spirit’s inside you, it’s a whole system they have over at that frat house they call church. [audience laughs] Who else uses Roman numerals?” [audience laughs] That joke makes it sound like I resent my religious upbringing and I do, so I nailed it. But… [audience cheers, claps] No, honestly, if I had to come up with some stuff that was like positive about my growing up religious, I’m sure I could with enough time and money but… [audience laughs] I do have some issues with it. It gave me some serious trust issues and it just made me weird, growing up in church, in ways that I am still discovering. For example, I just found out that I masturbate wrong. [audience laughs] I will back up. Okay, so… [audience laughs] When I was growing up in church, kids had youth group and at youth group, they were like, “Don’t have sex.” And we were like, “For sure, for sure.” And then, they were like, “Don’t even masturbate.” And all the girls were like, “Okay, we didn’t even know that we could.” [audience laughs] And all the boys were like, “Why?” And… [audience laughs] …the way they explained it to us was, our youth pastor told us, he goes, “It’s not the physical act of masturbating that’s the sin, you guys, alright? It’s not even the orgasm. In fact, if you have a wet dream, thank God for the freebie and have an awesome day. [audience laughs] But what are you thinking about while you’re doing that to yourself, guys? [scattered laughs] That’s what the sin is. It’s the lust in your heart. It’s the impure thoughts in your head. That is what the sin is.” So when I got to be an adult and I wanted to masturbate, I was like, “Well, if I just don’t think about anything, [audience laughs] I could probably still go to heaven, right? Just like, clear your mind, get in there, get it done, see you soon, Jesus, right? [audience laughs] Touch nothing but the lamb.” [audience laughs] [audience claps, cheers] So I’ve been doing this my entire adult life. All my friends are like, “You gotta meditate.” I’m like, “I think I do.” [audience laughs] And I do mean my entire adult life, by the way. I did not masturbate until I was a grown woman. I was that afraid of going to hell, alright? Yeah. I had my first orgasm with my college boyfriend. Do you know how embarrassing that is to get your first orgasm from another person? That’s like having a realtor show you your own house. [audience laughs] They’re like, “And over here, we have a second bathroom.” You’re like, “A second bathroom?” [audience laughs] “You’ve been here for 19 years, you never went poking around on your own?” You’re like, “I did once but I thought Jesus would get mad, [audience laughs] so yeah, I don’t actually own this place, I’m just renting it from the guy upstairs, and… if I flood the basement, I do not get my security deposit back, so… [audience laughs] Is there anything else I should see while you’re here?” She’s like, “Yeah, let me show you the doorbell.” I’m like, “Oh, is the doorbell even important?” She’s like, “The doorbell is the only thing that matters. [audience laughs, claps] Nobody comes inside without touching the doorbell.” [audience laughs] “Oh, but I did touch it.” “You didn’t use enough pressure, it didn’t light up.” [audience laughs] So I’ve been masturbating like this my entire adult life and I recently mentioned it to a friend of mine and you ever say something out loud and realize you never should have ever? [audience laughs] I said it so casually over brunch, didn’t even think about it. I was like, “Oh yeah, I mean, I don’t think about anything while I do that.” And she was like, “What?” She put her fork down. “What? [audience laughs] You don’t think about anything?” And I was like, “Oh, no, I mean, I think some stuff, obviously. And she was like, “What do you think about?” And I was like, “Oh, you know, just like, ‘almost there, making good time.’ [audience laughs] You know, just like road trip thoughts, like… ‘keep your hands steady, don’t fall asleep. Can’t wait to get there so I can eat. [audience laughs] Better hurry up, Taco Bell’s gonna close, ‘ you know.” [audience laughs] And she was like, “That is so weird, Taylor, why don’t you just watch porn like a normal person?” And I was like, “Ugh, I don’t like porn.” Every time I try to watch porn, I’m just like, “You gotta shave there, too? [audience laughs] I’m tired and I’m cold.” And I’m not against porn, okay? I’m not one of these people that’s like, “If you watch porn, it will ruin your relationship.” I don’t feel that way, alright? I dated a guy once who was really into massage porn where the masseuse would like fuck their client at the end which means sometimes when we had sex, I get a massage! [audience laughs, cheers] That’s an example of porn working for you! [audience laughs] But my friend was like horrified. She was like, “Taylor, this like monk masturbation thing you do, [audience laughs] it is so much creepier and weirder than any porn I’ve ever seen and I’ve seen most of it.” [audience laughs] And she goes, “There are so many different options porn-wise on the internet now, you… just go home and Google ‘porn for women’ okay? Just do it, I promise, ‘porn for women.'” And so I went home and I googled porn for women so I wouldn’t be weird at brunch. [audience laughs] And a lot of surprising things came up when I googled it. First thing that came up when I googled porn for women was a link to Disney Plus where all the Avengers movies are. Now… [audience laughs] For me, personally, they jump around too much. There’s too many storylines. You’re almost there with Loki and now we’re on Captain America? It’s like, I have to start over. That’s a different speed, a different pressure and now there’s a raccoon? No. [audience laughs] The second thing that came up when I googled porn for women was a website where real-life couples are uploading amateur sex tapes. Yeah, real-life couples are like, “Hey, we’re so happy and in love, we thought that we would film ourselves making love and then put it online for you, a lonely person. [audience laughs] Is it working? Are you wet?” And you’re like, “Not in the right place, no. [audience laughs] But congratulations, what you have seems really special.” [audience laughs] The last thing that came up when I googled porn for women I did not know existed, it’s something called audio porn. It’s exactly what it sounds like. There’s no visual aspect, it’s all audio. It’s not really a porn star, it’s more like a porn voice actor talking you through a sexy situation. It’s like a podcast except don’t listen while you’re driving. [audience laughs] And because it’s “for women,” that just means there’s a story, right? Anyone can watch, they don’t check. [audience laughs] They don’t just hop on the mic like, [shouting] “Now it’s out, bitch!” Like they ease you into it. And so the one I found is 20 minutes long. I will send it to you if you DM me. [audience laughs] And the first 12 minutes, the story, is just a man calming you down [audience laughs] after you’ve been in a car wreck. [audience laughs] That is the foreplay. [audience laughs] And you guys, I came so hard. I… [audience laughs, claps] I mean, I didn’t even make it to the sex part. It was the comfort alone. He’s like, “It’s okay, take some deep breaths, don’t worry.” “The insurance companies will figure it out.” I’m like, “Oh my God, that’s right!” [shouting] “That’s why we have insurance!” By the time he was like, “What else can I do? Should I go down on you?” I was like, “Nah, man, I got Allstate, I’m in good hands.” [audience laughs] Thank you so much, Boston, you were absolutely amazing. [audience cheers] Thank you so much. I can’t tell you, I really appreciate you. Thank you. [upbeat music] [audience cheers] You guys were amazing. Thank you so much, seriously.

       " ['Ladies and gentlemen, from the Barclay Theatre in Irvine, California, please welcome to the stage, Whitney Cummings. Love you. All bitches, come on! Thank you, guys, so much for coming out tonight, man. It’s so good to be doing standup again. I took like a couple of years off. I was making a television show… You didn’t fuckin’ watch it! You did not watch it, no you didn’t. ‘Cause if you had watched it, I wouldn’t fucking be here right now. No. I would be here. This is my favorite thing to do in the world. It is so good to be back doing standup. The last couple years were kind of… interesting. I think the most intense thing that happened to me was I went through a really painful breakup, but I’m glad it happened because actually I learned a lot. I feel like, you know what, I figured out why couples breakup. I think it’s this… I think couples break up because we’re all operating under different definitions of the word love. If you think about it, we say this word to each other, and I think it just makes us raise expectations. You know, I feel like if we were all to just agree on a universal definition of the word love, we’d stop disappointing each other so much, you know? So to me, my definition of love is being willing to die for someone… that you yourself want to kill. Which is kind of confusing… like if someone were to break into my house and hold up a gun to the person I love, I would jump in front of the gun. I’d go, “Wait, no, stop! Let me do it! Dude, I am begging you!” I also think in this culture we express love in a very twisted way. In this culture we show love by giving each other presents… jewelry and trips and stuff… and to me, that’s not what love’s about. That’s too easy, you know. For me love is about the way you treat a person on a daily basis when no one else is around. Little things, you know? Like if you love me, for example, the second sex is over, if I was on top, don’t push me off you… as quickly as possible… If you love me, you will let me dismount with a little fucking dignity. You will let me dismount like the swan that I am. Thank you, sir. Or, if you were on top, by some fucking miracle… don’t use my body as a pushing off point. When you get off, don’t push off my face… to go check your phone. It’s about respect. Love to me is about respect. Little things, you know. If you love me and we’re taking a shower together, don’t pee. Why is that so confusing? Don’t-don’t make me stand in your piss… like a fucking asshole. Use your head. You know, if you love me, you’ll think ahead. Little things like if you love me and you buy me lingerie as a gift, don’t buy me a small top and a medium bottom. Okay? If you love me, you will buy me a large top and a small bottom, and I’ll exchange that shit on my own time. Love is just like don’t be stupid. You know, little things. Like if you love me, let me wake up before you start having sex with me. Can I get some gum? Can you just give me a sec… This isn’t prison. I’m going to say ‘yes’. Have a little faith in yourself, you know?\\nI also think that phrase “I love you” is tricky because I think when you’re in a relationship for a long time, it starts to lose its value, you know. It starts to deteriorate. Like when you first say I love you, it’s such a big deal. You know, you’re like “I love you”, but after awhile, you’re just like “Love you!” Then after that, you’re just like, “You, too”, and finally you’re just like “Fuck you!”\\nLove is dangerous, you know. It’s a very dangerous thing we do. We give someone else the ability to hurt us. At any moment you could just get your heart broken, have your life ruined just like that, and I think that makes us all a little tense. I think we’re all a little on edge, you know. Love is so insane that when you hear about someone who’s in love who does a terrible thing, you side with them. Like when I hear about a woman who killed her husband, the first thing I think I’m like, well, what the fuck did he do? That poor woman!\\nLove makes you think about things you never thought you’d do before, you know? Like getting married. This last relationship I thought I was going to get married. For me, I never thought I was going to get married because I have all this divorce in my family, you know, but I also think that when you get older as a woman, marriage just becomes a little more appealing because marriage is set up for girls as an offer that you just cannot refuse, you know? If someone came up to me on the street randomly and marriage as an institution did not exist, and someone was just like, “Excuse me ma’am. Hi, um, would you be interested in a beautiful diamond ring and a bunch of parties where your friends will buy you whatever the fuck you want?” And then you get to move into somebody else’s house and get on their health insurance plan… And then if they cheat on you, you get half their shit, no questions asked. Would you be interested in that? Yeah, man, yeah, yeah. How do I get all that shit? Well, you just have to have sex with the same man for the rest of your life. Ohhh. You know, fuck it. I have Tylenol PM. Let’s do this shit. Where do I sign up? It’s not that we love you. We just want shit, okay? It’s the same thing with sex. Like we don’t always have sex with you guys because we like want that dick. No! No! Okay? Half the time I have sex with a guy, it’s because it burns calories. I’m like oh, God. I had that lasagna today… I don’t have time to go to the gym, so… I should probably just fuck this guy. But I really go for it, you know. I wear a terrycloth headband and ankle weights. I get in there and… In this last relationship, I was going so insane that I started doing research to try to figure out what goes on chemically in your brain when you’re in love. And I read this book called The Female Brain. Has anyone read this book? Ooh! One… dude? All right, what you got going on over here considering the fact that you’re with a dude? Why would you need that book? I respect that. You just wanted to get a head start, just kind of figure it out. So you’re just here alone? I respect that. You’re not going home alone… that’s for sure. That book’s amazing, right? This book is all about the way women’s brains are wired, and essentially it said that we have like millions of more emotions and hormones and like synapses that connect… basically, it’s a miracle that we’re not crying all the fucking time… which is a bummer because I feel like guys hate that, you know? You know, I feel like guys hate that women are so emotional and sensitive, right? You guys think women are crazy, right? Yes? Okay. All right. You think this is fun for me? You think I would ever choose this for myself? You think I enjoy crying every time Adele is on the radio? That’s embarrassing, okay. You think I enjoy Googling your ex-girlfriend three hours a day? You think I have that kind of time? You think I enjoy trying to guess every one of your security question answers? Oh, shit! What street did he grow up on? It’s weird because that’s all I hear from guys is that women are crazy. Women are so crazy. But I have tons of girlfriends, and I hang out with my girlfriends alone all the time, and when guys aren’t around, women are super cool, rational, logical, but then they start dating some dude, and they lose their mind.\\nWomen are not crazy… you guys fucking make us that way. Okay? I’m just sayin’, take your passwords off your fucking phones. It’s just weird because I feel like being crazy and sensitive… like that doesn’t have to be a negative thing. I think that’s kind of an asset, you know? I think girls should be paranoid and hypervigilant and emotional because we’re responsible for raising helpless babies. Okay? We can’t think like you guys. We can’t be fucking sociopaths… or else babies would just die… all the time and our species would be extinct. Like if we felt like you guys, we would give birth to a baby, you know, take it home from the hospital if we even went to the hospital… because I don’t need a doctor. Then we would like put it in the sink for a month. Just throw Doritos on it, every now and then spray it with Axe Body Spray… And when we were done with it, we would just like put it on Craig’s List, like,',\n",
       "  ' ah, I can get a few bucks for that. I feel like you guys think that we like choose to be crazy, you know? It’s an act of choice. Like I feel like you guys think that we wake up on any given morning and just decide we’re going to have a terrible day. I feel like you guys think we wake up and we’re like oh my God, I’m going to have such a good day today. I’m going to hang out with my boyfriend, we’re going to go hang out, see a movie… you know what? No. I have a better idea. I’m going to wake up, feel fat for two hours… then get mad at my boyfriend because he said good morning in a weird tone… then I’m going to break up with him in my head… I’m not going to tell him we broke up. It’s none of his fucking business whether we’re together or not. Then I’m going to go spend $200 on jeans that don’t fit… then I’m going to go eat cucumbers with barbecue sauce on them… then I’m going to get mad at him again because he suggested we see a Scarlett Johansson movie… what the fuck is that? Then I’m going to go spend two hours online looking at wedding dresses. Not a great day for us, either, you know? I think it’s funny that guys are never called crazy because I feel like guys do things that are like, crazy, you know? But guys are never called crazy. Like, for a guy to get called crazy, he’s got to be like… he’s got to be like naked in an alley jerking off on a dead pigeon… singing bible hymns like “Over the River”… But even then we’re like, oh my God, that guy is homeless. That is so sad. Do you have a dollar? Give him a dollar. But for a girl to get called crazy, we just have to send you two text messages in a row. She’s fucking crazy, man. She’s fucking stalking me, bro. She’s obsessed with me, man. I’m like I don’t know, I’m not crazy. I’m just locked out of the house. Can you let me in the house? I’m not stalking you. I live here. My house. We live together. I’m not obsessed with you. I hate you, so… Guys are never called crazy, but I feel like guys do things that are actually crazy. Like things that would put you in an insane asylum. Like you guys will talk to athletes in the TV. You think they can fucking hear you. That’s literal schizophrenia. That is a mental illness. Like I was watching some of my guy friends a couple of months ago. They were watching a Giants game and they were talking to Eli Manning. They were having a conversation with this person. They were like, Eli, listen to me. Eli, listen to me. We have been through this, bro. I’m like, bitch, you’ve not been through shit with him, man. He cannot hear you, and even if he could hear you, why would he take advice from you? You can’t even get your Heinekens in the fucking garbage can. I feel like you guys watching sports should give you a little more sympathy for us because now you know what it’s like to yell at a man and have him completely ignore you. Every day is Sunday for us. You guys say the meanest things to these athletes, the meanest things. Like they were watching Tom Brady and they were like Tom Brady, you suck. Tom Brady sucks. I don’t know that much about football, but I’m pretty sure Tom Brady doesn’t suck at football. I’m pretty sure you suck. I’m pretty sure all you suck at football. I just wish these athletes would stand up for themselves, you know, against these horrible things you say. I wish just one time Tom Brady would look directly into the camera and be like, “Hey man, fuck you, I got this… “I make 20 million dollars a year “and you can’t even do a fucking sit-up… Get off my dick, man.”\\nThat’s where you guys get delusional about sports. Like I feel if we get delusional about like relationship stuff, but sports is where you guys kind of lose your mind. Like I have this guy friend who… he carries a football around in his car… like bitch, you’re 50. No one wants to play football with you. Like to him it’s like… like it’s not over yet, you know. Like in his mind he’s going to get a call… Like any minute he’s getting a phone call. If the coach of the Giants doesn’t call him like, “Hey, man. “Eli’s hurt… You still got that football in your car?” I’m trying to kind of take responsibility for my part in being crazy, you know? I’m trying to be more mature in relationships, and I don’t think that it’s just women who are biologically fixed to be crazy… I don’t think that’s it. I think there’s a lot of socialization that messes us up, too. Like I realize I have incredibly high expectations for romance, and I don’t even know where they come from. Like I realized recently when I get off a plane, I fully expect the guy that I’m dating to be waiting for me at the airport, surprising me. What shitty movie did we see… You know what? I actually… I think it was Crocodile Dundee… I swear to God. Remember in the ’90s all those guys were like just rushing to the airport? Because as an adult, today, I will fully get off a plane. I will go on the escalator and I will be like… Fucking asshole. Which is so unfair to you guys, you know? Because if you guys were to actually do that, it would be a complete disaster. If the guy I was dating showed up at the airport when I got off the plane, all tired and sticky and shit, I’d be like, dude, what the fuck are you doing? He’d be like oh, I just, you know, wanted to come surprise you at the airport. I’d be like, you drove to the airport? I drove to the airport. Now we have two cars at the fucking airport! What lot are you in? You’re in lot B? We have to take a bus to your lot? Oh, you piece of shit! That’s crazy, you know, but I think there are a lot of things that contribute to us being a little irritable, you know? I think that part of girls being crazy is the fact that being a female is just so frustrating. Like there’s so much work we have to do, there’s so much maintenance that goes into it, and most of what we do is to make you guys think we’re attractive, so we’re resentful, you know. I feel like by 9 AM we already hate you. Okay? Because of all this shit we have to do from 8 to 9 AM to make you think we’re fuckin’ pretty. Like do you know the kind of shit that goes on in your bathroom, sir? You don’t know. You’re wearing shorts. And what are those… are those Crocs? Oh my God, white people are so embarrassing. Unbelievable! And she… you don’t understand the kind of stuff that goes on in the bathroom. She’s working hard and you’re wearing… your pajamas. This is unbelievable. Do you realize the things that we do? We spray aerosol. We inhale aerosol every day. Okay? Then we put on makeup which is just chemicals and poison… then we put on perfume which is pure alcohol. It’s not that we bitchy… we’re just high… most of the time. Bitches are just lit up everywhere. Have you ever seen a girl put on perfume. She’s like eh, eh, eh… Ah-h-h. Okay, let’s go. Where we going? The torture we put ourselves through… it’s just annoying, you know? Like do you know what eyeliner is, sir? Do you have any idea? A little bit. A little bit, little bit, little bit. Sorry, I can’t stop looking at your scrotum. Unbelievable! Eyeliner… no idea. Just based on the word eye…liner. Zero? Nothing. Zip. Guys don’t even know. Do you have any idea, sir? – I can take a hint. – You can take a hint. Okay, let’s see. You apply it to your eye. See, this is… he’s my worst nightmare. This is my worst nightmare. This is literal guy. This is the guy who in a fight, he just sticks to the facts. To win… he’s the guy who’s like, “No, no, no I didn’t say you were a bitch. I said you were being a bitch.” And you’re like, okay, I got to go regroup… I’ll be right back. Does any guy know how eyeliner is applied? This amazes me. The guy has no idea. With a brush. With a brush… no! That’s another masochistic thing we do. That’s eye shadow… it’s applied with a brush. The point of eye shadow is to make us look like we have black eyes, so why don’t you take a good hard look at yourself and why you think that’s attractive, sickos. I can’t do eye shadow myself. It’s actually difficult to do. I just have to be like baby, can you punch me in the face? I’m going to work. Eyeliner… nothing. This is amazing to me. Eyeliner. What’s that? Do you know how? With a pen? No! What else, what’s close to pen? – A pencil. – Pencil! Doesn’t that sou',\n",
       "  'nd a little fucking dangerous to anybody else? We’re putting pencils in our eyeballs. Like I think the first thing you learn as a child is do not get a pencil near your eye… until you become an adult woman… in which case we want you to put it inside your eyeball every morning. We know you’re probably going to do it while you’re driving. We don’t care… only way to get a man to like you. I was worried that it was taking some kind of toll on our eyesight, like collectively as women, you know. I feel like putting ink and pencils and dye… this has got to be bad for our vision. You know, sometimes women see shit that’s just not fucking there. I think there’s a correlation. I used to always accuse my ex of checking out hot chicks in front of me. He’d be like what chicks… I don’t see any chicks. I’d be like I don’t know, motherfucker. I don’t have any peripheral vision anymore, from all this eyeliner. I see hot chicks everywhere. So much suffering. There’s so much pain involved in being a girl, you know? I don’t think women are weak. I think women are too strong because we just endure it. We just take it and don’t complain about it, but I do think that it manifests in other ways. Like next time you’re talking to a girl and you think she’s acting like shitty or unreasonable, just remember that she’s got a polyester string in her asshole. Yeah, she’s probably a little stressed out, okay? We’re all a little on edge, and I think that’s probably why. A guy will be like what’s up your ass? I’m like uh-h-h. I can tell you right now, it’s a polyester string I paid $35 for. That I can’t even put in the fucking dryer. Do you have a question? I can’t do a lot of it, you know. I can’t do high heels. I cannot do high heels because I feel like it makes me shitty. I get in a bad mood when I’m wearing high heels, you know. It’s just so weird to me. Some of you guys are here with girls tonight whose feet are bleeding. But you’re not doing anything about it. It’s not even weird… you’re not getting them a Band-Aid, nothing. It’s just accepted that we like limp around, you know. I also don’t like it because I feel like when I do, the guy that I’m with will get mad at me for wearing heels, you know? He’ll go why are you wearing those high-heeled shoes? It’s going to ruin our whole night because you’re going to be complaining the entire time about your feet hurting and I’m going to have to go get the car and pull the car around. Like um, hey bro, I’m wearing heels so that you want to fuck me. Because if I don’t, you’re going to leave me for someone who does. I’ve seen porn, and none of those bitches are wearing Aerosoles. Just go get the car. Like I’m always trying to look good for guys and it’s always backfiring on me, you know? Like when I’m taking too long in the bathroom… you’re taking forever in the bathroom. We’re going to miss our reservation. I’m like I’m sorry… I’m just in here trying to make you think I’m pretty. I’m not in a huge rush to get to the restaurant. It’s not like I can eat anything once we get there anyway. I’m fucking starving to death. I haven’t had bread since ’95, so just be cool, man. Then we get in trouble for that. Why are you always on a diet? You’re always on a diet. I’m on a diet because I’m trying to get the body of the women you jerk off to after I fall asleep. It’s not just that I love lettuce. Okay? I don’t love lettuce. What is the confusion. It’s always something, man. Why are you always cold? Why are you always cold? You’re always cold. I’m cold because I lasered my entire body… so that you would think I’m soft, you fucking pedophile. Unbelievable! Actually, there’s a lot of stuff you guys don’t know. You know there’s a lot of stuff you guys don’t know and I feel like if you knew about it, you’d be a little less frustrated with us, you know? Like there’s so much stuff you guys don’t know. Like you guys don’t know about the voices. No one told you about that shit, huh? You think it’s bad when our mouths are moving… no, that’s the best case scenario. It’s when our mouths are shut that you need to be concerned. Because that means we’re fucking thinking. That’s when all the problems start. Because I feel like in this culture girls are taught to be so self-critical. You know, we compare ourselves to such an impossible physical ideal that we’re always judging ourselves. You know, I’m so insecure at this point I just have this constant inner monologue saying the meanest shit to me all the time. It’s just like, “Hey, Whitney, “your thighs are touching… “You probably shouldn’t have had that cheese “last night, you fuckin’ pig. “You haven’t gone to the gym yet today… “that’s an interesting choice. “I guess you’re just going to die alone. “Even if a man does marry you, you’re so loud he’s going to leave you for an Asian girl.” Just the meanest stuff, constantly. But I feel like guys don’t have that same insecurity, you know? Obviously. I don’t think guys are self-critical like that. I feel like guys doing a monologue is totally different. I feel like guys doing a monologue are like, “What’s up, bro? “Looking awesome! “Really killing it today, per usual. “Dude, I don’t think you need to shave today… “that weird black hair growing out of your back looks cool. “Dude, do not shave your face. “Fuck your girlfriend and her bloody chin. “Fuck her! “Dude, I’m thinking you should wear “those awesome cargo shorts again today. With socks and sandals.” Must be nice. Must be nice to like yourselves. I feel like I spend so much time trying to figure out what guys are thinking about, you know? That’s like our favorite thing to do as girls, right… ask guys what they’re thinking, you know? “Hey babe, what are you thinking about… ” it’s always the same shit, right? “Nothin’.” Like we got to stop doing that. That has never gone well for any girl. Like no girl in the history of time was ever like “Hey babe, what are you thinking about…” And the guy was like, “Well… …I’m glad you asked. “I was just thinking about how young you look “and how much I love monogamy. Can we talk about it?” No, it’s always the same shit, right? “Nothin’.” But, you know what… I’ve finally come to terms with the fact that I think guys really do think about fuckin’ nothing. Like I feel like guys drive down the street and this is pretty much what goes on in your mind. Driving down the street just in your car… “Tree. “Tree. Damn, she’s got big tits.” But then that’s pretty much it. Right? If there’s no emotion, it’s just like thing, thing, stuff, thing, thing, stuff, thing.\\nBut for me to drive down that same street, nightmare. Stress. Memories, emotions, triggering. So much drama. For me to drive down that same street, it’s like, Oh my God, look at that tree. My ex-boyfriend had a tree in his yard. Oh my God! I miss him so much. Oh, look at that tree. That tree’s thinner than me. What the fuck… I hate trees. Well, who’s this bitch with the big tits? And that’s just to get to Rite-Aid. It’s just a saga. You know, I was explaining this to a guy friend of mine. I was explaining this to a guy friend of mine and I was just telling him, you know, that I think that being a girl is just more of a challenge sometimes because we have more to think about, you know. We have to worry about all this superficial stuff… our, you know, nails getting done, our hair, our clothes and matching and purses and stuff. He’s like “Yeah, yeah, but that’s not our fault. “That’s not our fault because women don’t dress for men. Women dress for other women.” Does anyone fuck… I will fight you right now… All of you. Women do not dress for other women. That’s such a ridiculous philosophy. Look, I’ve never been getting ready putting on a miniskirt like yeah, my waitress tonight is going to love this. Like, no, women do not dress for other women and I know this because I have girls’ nights in my house. And when girls are alone and no guys are around, we look like sea creatures. Okay? It looks like a pirate ship crashed into my house. Okay? We all got dreadlocks, we’re wearing slankets around, pajama jeans, all our leg hairs just in corn rows. We have our dicks hanging out. If a girl comes over with makeup on, I’m like, “Bitch, go wash your face. Whose team ',\n",
       "  'are you on?” I do think this idea, though, is kind of at the root of the philosophy that people think that women don’t like other women. I think that happens because when we’re super dressed up to impress a guy and we see each other, we avoid each other because we’re so embarrassed of all the pathetic, desperate shit we’re doing to impress a dude. You know, like when I’m super dressed up in a push-up bra and a mini dress and heels and I see a group of girls, I’m not like, “What’s up, bitches? I don’t think you’re ready for this jelly.” No! When I see a group of girls, I’m so humiliated at all the dumb, slutty shit I’m doing, I’m like, “Oh God, hi. “Um… “I know this is bad. “It’s just that he’s really shallow and um, “I’m in my 30’s now, so I’ve got to make a move, “you know what I mean… and he’s got a 401k… you get it.” I don’t like that idea that women don’t like other women. I don’t think that’s true. I just think that women support other women when it really counts. You know, we come in and have each other’s back when it really counts… like when we go to the bathroom together. You want to know what’s going on in there? There’s one girl having a bad night, a bunch of bitches who have never met each other in their lives are like soldiers at war, nursing each other’s wounds. One girl is on the floor… I’m like, all right, pull those Spanx up. Somebody get a Band-Aid for that blister. Someone… her eyebrow just melted off… gotta get a Sharpie to draw that shit back on. All right, someone get some Super Glue for those eye lashes. Her hair extensions just fell out… someone get a stapler to staple that horsehair back on her head. Now, bitch, you wipe the tears off your tits and you listen to me right now. You’re going to go back out there, put a smile on your face and pretend he’s interesting. Go! Thank you! I don’t like that at all. I think when women are nasty with other women, it’s much more subtle, like it’s much more insidious, you know. Like I have this girlfriend, every time I see her, she’d be like, “Hey, hooker. ‘s up, slut?” Which that’s never going to feel good, you know? But to me it’s just a reminder that I think we need to stop using the word hooker as a pejorative term. I have a lot of respect for hookers. I think they work very hard and they do a lot of the jobs that we don’t want to fucking do. They are cleaning up a lot of messes out there. They are American heroes. I also think hookers look at us like we’re the idiots, you know? They look at us and they’re like, “Those bitches are having sex for free? What a bunch of fuckin’ whores.” So silly. I don’t know, man. I feel like when I was trying to figure out what guys were thinking about, I came across some stuff that was just too discouraging, you know. Like I came across an article that said that guys think about sex at least every five minutes. Was that like disturbing, right? Like you guys are responsible for like really important shit like wars and bombs, and you guys can’t focus for five fucking minutes… Like important men are thinking about sex every five minutes which is like Barack Obama thinks about sex every five minutes which probably explains why he’s always stuttering during his fucking speeches. It’s like, dude, get your shit together, man, you know? But you’ll see it happen. You’ll see him giving a speech and you’ll see that five-minute mark hit. You’ll see sex enter his mind. He’ll be like, “We’re going to go into Afghanistan “and we’re going to discuss the… “um, we’re going to, “ah, we’re going to get on the, uh, Dude, I just saw that, man. You were just thinking about titties… Afghan titties. I saw it happen.\\nIt’s just concerning to me. I feel like there are a lot of jobs where you guys probably need to focus, right? Like heart surgeons think about sex every five minutes and heart surgeries are like five hours long, so that’s like 60 times. Like you know heart surgeons are just sitting there looking at an open heart like yeah, I’d put my dick in that. I said it.\\nIt’s kind of weird, though, that guys think about sex. Like we’ve accepted it so much as a society now. You know, it’s so institutionalized. We’ve embraced it, you know. Like there’s just a restaurant called Hooters… that’s just a restaurant. Whereas there would never be a restaurant like that for women, you know, called like Dongs. Where all the waiters were like in Speedos and shit because that would be a disgusting fucking restaurant. Nobody would ever eat there. We do not want to see your flaccid dicks in spandex… I gotta be honest. It looks like a hamster stuck in a water balloon. No. No. So it’s like some weird shitake mushroom coming out… It’s always going up like a snorkel. Like why is it up? Get it down there! It’s always like on one side, all mis… why is it so misallocated? Disgusting.\\nLike if there was going to be a restaurant like that for women where the waiters were dressed up to arouse the women eating there, they would not be in Speedos, okay? They’d be wearing suits, carrying briefcases, holding up their perfect credit reports. Like I feel like girls don’t need like sex while we’re doing our jobs, you know. Right? Like you would never turn on the Cooking Channel and see like a bunch of shirtless dudes like yeah, girl, ooh, yeah, yeah. Just put that butter on the pan, girl. Just get it in the roast. I just realized I don’t know anything about cooking. Did you see the wheels just turning there? Like it wasn’t even clo… Roast? No one does a roast anymore. I’m going to work on that. You guys just need sex all the time. Like in completely nonsexual situations, guys need sex, you know. Like sports, perfect example. Football. You guys are watching football and you’ve got these amazing athletes on the field doing amazing things, incredible. They’re flying, they’re doing phenomenal things. Not enough for you. You still need whores around the perimeter… of the field. God forbid there’d be two seconds without a tit in the background of something you’re watching. Cheerleaders crack me up, man. So funny to me because that’s so obviously a guy’s idea, you know. Like a guy obviously thought of that because the cheerleaders still cheer even when their team is fucking losing… they cheer. No real women would ever act like that. If her man was out on the field for five hours on a Sunday bombing, she wouldn’t be like go, baby, go, go. She’d be like Jason, we’re leaving. First of all, you’re embarrassing me, okay? Second of all, I’m freezing cold, I have to pee, and Target closes in 20 minutes. Wrap it up. I think I figured out why guys like sex more. I think it’s biological. I think it’s because sex is so much better for guys. You know, it’s so much easier. Like for a guy… sex is better for guys because it’s so much easier for you guys to have an orgasm. You know, like for a guy to have an orgasm, it’s just like… it’s like you just… Pretty much all that has to happen is you just have to kind of walk into something or… There has to be like a drizzle out, you know. Which, by the way, I have narrowed down men’s orgasms to three basic categories. Like there’s three basic ones… The first one is like you just got shot in the back with an arrow… The second one is like you’re puking… And the third one is a rare one, but it’s for the guys that are like secretly psychos and they hate women and it’ll come out like right at the finish line, you know, like out of nowhere. They’ll be like yeah, I love you, I need you, yeah. Shut up, you dumb whore! I’m like, oh no! I thought we were in love.\\nYou know for a woman to have an orgasm it is so hard… it is so hard to have an orgasm. It’s… I cannot wait to have one. I hear they’re great. I mean seriously, for a girl to have an orgasm, you’ve got to be like… you’ve got to be like focused. You have to be like emotionally connected. You’ve got to be relaxed. You’ve got to be in great shape, and it makes it even harder because you guys watch porn and you think that the porn stars are having orgasms, but they’re all faking it and they make it look so fucking easy. Like porn stars will be just like’ “Ooh, I’m coming, I’m coming, I’m coming.” That’s nothing. That’s she’s coming down from a meth binge. Nothing’s happe',\n",
       "  'ning to her. I can’t compete with that, you know.\\nLike if your girl is having an orgasm, she’s not going ooh, I’m coming, I’m coming. If your girl is having an orgasm, she’s going’ “Do not fucking move!” I swear to God, I will fucking kill you. Bastard! Slower. Tell me you love me… you better fucking mean it this time! Kiss me on the mouth, goddamnit! Pull my hair, not the extensions! Shut up, you dumb whore!\\nSeriously, for me to have an orgasm, like my right leg has to be behind my left shoulder… Like you’ve got a charleyhorse in your ass, you know. You got those crazy bloodshot eyes going, veins in our foreheads. Our foreheads look like your dicks… just veins…\\nI know it’s not easy for you guys, either. Now you guys have to like do so much work. You guys have to hit the same spot like 500 times, you know. That’s why I like to be helpful during sex, you know. That’s why I treat sex like the game “Operation”. If the guy misses, I’m just like… I used to be very against porn, you know. I thought it was bad for women and like degrading and shit, but now I kind of like it. Uh, because you know why… because I watched it, and when I watched it, I learned so much stuff that I had to be kind of grateful for it. I learned watching porn that the girls in porn they’ll request to the man where they want him to finish which I didn’t know that was an option. See, nobody told me that we had a vote in that. I’ve just been taking whatever shots have been coming at me… since 1998… I don’t know. I feel like I’ve been storming the shores of Normandy… That’s a history joke. I don’t know. Now that I know that’s an option… to request where you’d want the man to finish… I’m I’m ready. Now I’ve got some ideas. Maybe like, yeah, I really want you to come… In the bathroom? You just want to time that out… whatever you’ve got to do to just… In the sink! I like the big one, though.\\nThe big one in porn is the coming on the face. That’s the big one, right? Yeah. Let’s talk about it. Like I really think that as a society we kind of need to discuss why we like this so much, you know, and why you guys think that we like love it. Like who told you that we like need it? No, nobody ever wants this to happen to them. If a girl asks you to come on her face, it’s because she thinks you’re going to breakup with her. Always buys you at least another month or so. My problem with it is like the second it’s over. You know, I try to be fun. You know while it’s happening I can get into it, you know, because while it’s happening you can be like yeah, yeah, yeah, ooh, yeah. Look at us. Yeah, hit me, hit me. Yeah, ooh, yeah. We are so crazy. We are wild and crazy… Can I get like a towel or something? Or maybe like a baby wipe or some… or maybe like a pick ax because now it’s turned to stone. I can’t open my fucking eyes. He’s not going to help you. He’s too busy taking photos to send his friends. You guys are animals. But I get why guys watch porn. I get it now because it’s so obvious. It’s just that naked women are hot. All naked women are hot. You know, there’s so much to look at, yeah. It’s disgusting of you. You’re with a date, man. That’s going to be a fight. But, right? All boobs and butts… they all look amazing, you know? That’s why you guys watch porn. Girls don’t watch porn as much because naked guys… uck! Such a bummer, you know. It’s just such a… this whole Wes Craven situation you got going on… it’s just disgusting, you know. It’s a lot… it’s a lot to take. Because like when a dick comes on the screen, we’re not like yeah, “Look at that dick. Yeah, I want that dick.” No. When a dick comes on the screen, we’re like, “Oh, there’s a dick. “What’s it doing? “What’s the dick doing? Does it see me? Does the dick see me?” Like there’s just nothing attractive about it, you know. Like dicks are so ugly… that the second you guys are born, someone has to cut some of it off. To make it even somewhat presentable to society. You guys love your dicks though, man, you love them. You’re going yeah! Dicks! You guys walk around, you lead with it. Lead with it, just walking around, just letting it go. Yeah, just loving my dick. You know when you guys are alone, you’re just like… You guys walk around so proud of it. You guys walk around like you got a first place trophy in-between your legs. I got news for you… it doesn’t look like a first place trophy. Looks like an old yam. Have you seen it? Have you… you know what… no, you haven’t seen it because your hand is always on it. You’ve never actually seen it before. Always touchin’ it. Always touchin’ it, touchin’ it, touchin’ it. What do you… what are you do… Are you cleaning it off, like are you trying to get three wishes out of it? Leave it alone. Just let it just dry off.\\nYou know what that means, right? You’re always touching your dicks. You know what that means… you got dick on your hands… all of you. You have dick, dick, dick, dick, dicking hands. All of you. You see guys know that. Guys are in on it. That’s why guys are always giving each other the fist pump. They know, you know. Did you ever see two guys walk towards each other? Like hey man, what’s up, man? Yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah. I’ve been touching my dick today, too, man. Yeah, we both got dicks. We got dicks. Like that’s like your whole day. Just like eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh. That’s the trick. That is the trick of dating is that when you get back out there, you’ve got to see all these new dicks, you know? I know, it’s a lot. Like when you live with someone for a while or you’re married, you get used to their dick, you know? It’s like it grows on you. It’s like a basset hound… like it’s ugly but it’s yours. You know. It’ll come over and like hey, what are you doing? You’re like hi, dick, what’s u-up? Do you want to hang out? No, not really. But when you’re single, man, you’ve got to see all these new dicks. You know, you’ve got to, you’ve got to really get in there, you know. But the problem is when you see a new dick because every new dick is a whole new set of WebMD searches. You know. You’ve got to inspect the new ones. You’ve got to make sure everything’s legit. You’ve got to make sure everything’s, you know, safe. You know, but the problem is when you get that close to a dick, you’re that close to a dick. You know what happens when you’re that close to a dick. Yeah. You’ve got to put that thing in your mouth. And it’s not because we want to… it’s because something happens when a woman’s face is within like a foot of a man’s dick where a hand will come down… And you can’t get out… it moves with you. Oh shit! Fine! That is so rude!\\nMan, I don’t mean to be mean about it… I just feel like you guys don’t see it from our perspective, you know. You don’t see what we see. You know, we’ve got to see this super weird transformation happen that is so creepy, you know. Here’s the thing… anything that changes in shape, size, and color without your permission is a little fucking weird. You know. Like from our point of view, it is terrifying. Like this is what it looks like from our point of view, just so you guys know. Okay, it’ll start out just hanging, chilling. You’re touchin’ it, touchin’ it. Then you’re like… it’ll hear like a noise or… Um? “Would you like to play?” I love you guys. Thank you so much for coming down for the show, everybody. Thank you. I just want to say I really appreciate you guys coming out. Standup is my favorite thing to do in the world and I do it for you guys. So, thank you so much for supporting me. I love you very much.
